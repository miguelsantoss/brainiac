In terms of clinical utility, however, a more important issue concerns the ability of the technique to differentiate between normal elderly control subjects and AD patients with the very mildest form of the disease. We performed MRI-based volumetric measurements of the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala in 126 cognitively normal elderly control subjects and 94 patients with probable AD. The diagnosis of AD was made according to NINDS/ADRDA criteria, and disease severity was categorized by Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores. Patients with CDR 0.5 were classified as very mild, CDR 1 as mild, and CDR 2 as moderate disease severity. Volumes of each structure declined with increasing age in control subjects and did so in parallel for men and women. The volume of each measured MTL structure also declined with age in patients with AD. The volume of each MTL structure was significantly smaller in AD patients than control subjects (p < 0.001). Of the several MTL measures, the total hippocampal volumetric measurements were best at discriminating control subjects from AD patients. The mean hippocampal volumes for AD patients relative to control subjects by severity of disease were as follows: very mild AD (CDR 0.5) -1.75 SD below the control mean, mild AD (CDR 1) -1.99 SD, and moderate AD (CDR 2) -2.22 SD. Age- and gender-adjusted, normalized MRI-based hippocampal volumetric measurements provide a sensitive marker of the MTL neuroanatomic degeneration in AD early in the disease process.","authors":[{"name":"Clifford R.

In addition, the relationship between APOE-epsilon4 genotype and volumetric indices was examined.\n\nMETHOD:\nMRI-based volume measurements of the whole-brain, ventricles, frontal lobe, temporal lobe, hippocampus, and amygdala were acquired in elderly subjects with DLB (n = 27; mean age = 75.9 years), AD (n = 25; 77.2 years), VaD (n = 24; 76.9 years), and normal control subjects (n = 26; 76.2 years).\n\nRESULTS:\nSubjects with DLB had significantly larger temporal lobe, hippocampal, and amygdala volumes than those with AD. No significant volumetric difference between subjects with DLB and VaD was observed. Compared with control subjects, ventricular volumes were increased in all patients with dementia, though those with DLB showed a relative preservation of whole-brain volume. There were no significant differences in frontal lobe volumes between the four groups. APOE-epsilon4 status was not associated with volumetric indices.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nThe findings support the hypothesis that DLB is associated with a relative preservation of temporal lobe structures.

Linear mixed-effect models were used to estimate differences of rates of change and to provide standardized effect sizes (d) with 95% confidence intervals (CI).\n\nRESULTS:\nA composite panel of 10 informative markers was identified. Significant relative worsening (PD vs HC) was seen with the following markers: the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale I (d 0.39; CI 0.09-0.70), the Autonomic Scale for Outcomes in Parkinson's Disease (d 0.25; CI 0.06-0.46), the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (d 0.47; CI 0.24-0.71), the RBD Screening Questionnaire (d 0.44; CI 0.25-0.64), and RBD by PSG (d 0.37; CI 0.19-0.55) as well as VBM units of cortical gray matter (d -0.2; CI -0.3 to -0.09) and hippocampus (d -0.15; CI -0.27 to -0.03). Markers with a relative improvement included the Nonmotor Symptom (Severity) Scale (d -0.19; CI -0.36 to -0.02) and 2 depression scales (Beck Depression Inventory d -0.18; CI -0.36 to 0; Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale d -0.26; CI -0.47 to -0.04). Unexpectedly, cognitive measures and select laboratory markers were not significantly changed in PD vs HC participants.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nCurrent CSF biomarkers and cognitive scales do not represent useful progression markers. However, sleep and imaging measures, and to some extent NMS, assessed using adequate scales, may be more informative markers to quantify progression.","authors":[{"name":"Brit Mollenhauer"},{"name":"Johannes Zimmermann"},{"name":"Friederike Sixel-D\u00f6ring"},{"name":"Niels K.

However, the influence of AET on their motor learning capacities, as well as the change in neural substrates mediating this effect remains to be explored.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nIn the current study, we employed functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to assess the effect of a 3-month AET program on the neural correlates of implicit motor sequence learning (MSL).\n\nMETHODS:\n20 healthy controls (HC) and 19 early PD individuals participated in a supervised, high-intensity, stationary recumbent bike training program (3 times/week for 12 weeks). Exercise prescription started at 20 min (+ 5 min/week up to 40 min) based on participant's maximal aerobic power. Before and after the AET program, participants' brain was scanned while performing an implicit version of the serial reaction time task.\n\nRESULTS:\nBrain data revealed pre-post MSL-related increases in functional activity in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum in PD patients, as well as in the striatum in HC individuals. Importantly, the functional brain changes in PD individuals correlated with changes in aerobic fitness: a positive relationship was found with increased activity in the hippocampus and striatum, while a negative relationship was observed with the cerebellar activity.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nOur results reveal, for the first time, that exercise training produces functional changes in known motor learning related brain structures that are consistent with improved behavioural performance observed in PD patients. As such, AET can be a valuable non-pharmacological intervention to promote, not only physical fitness in early PD, but also better motor learning capacity useful in day-to-day activities through increased plasticity in motor related structures.","authors":[{"name":"C.

Although cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies show correlation between regional brain volume loss and cognitive impairment, there is only scarce evidence from longitudinal studies validating the link between cognition and brain anatomy in PD.\n\nObjective\nTo test the relationship between magnitude and spatial extent of atrophy in PD patients with progressive, significant cognitive decline and dementia (PDD).\n\nMethods\nWe followed thirty-three initially non-demented patients with prevalent PD for three years while monitoring cognitive function and brain atrophy. Longitudinally acquired T1-weighted magnetic resonance images were analyzed in the voxel-based morphometry framework of SPM.\n\nResults\nGroups did not differ significantly with respect to age or gender. More males developed PDD (7 males, 3 females) compared to those remaining intact (12 males, 11 females). Clusters of lower grey matter volume were found in PDD compared to PD in left uncus at baseline and an expanded region that included the left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus at 36 months. The cognitive status by scan interaction showed differential changes between groups in the right insula. At a more liberal statistical threshold we observed changes in the right insula and bilateral hippocampi as well as the right cuneus additional to the lower brain stem.\n\nConclusions\nRegion specific atrophy, consistent with the pattern of cortical Lewy body deposition seen in autopsy studies, can be detected with MRI in PD patients with significant cognitive decline. MRI may be useful for tracking cognitive decline in PD.","authors":[{"name":"Myrlene Gee"},{"name":"Juergen Dukart"},{"name":"Bogdan Draganski"},{"name":"W. R.

We also examined 15 pain-free healthy participants of similar age, gender, and cognitive state as a control group. We assessed pain by the King's Parkinson's Pain Scale, the Visual Analogue Scale for pain, and the Leeds Assessment for Neuropathic Symptoms and Sign. All patients underwent structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting-state functional MRI. We compared clinical characteristics, whole-brain cortical thickness, subcortical volumes, diffusion tensor imaging scalar measures, and functional connectivity by network based statistics.\nRESULTS:\nThe group with PD and persistent pain showed significant thinning in the bilateral temporal pole, left-medial orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral superior and left-inferior parietal areas, pars orbicularis, and right superior frontal, posterior cingulated, and precentral cortex. There were no significant subcortical volume and white matter differences between PD subgroups. Functional MRI showed a decrease of brain activity in the left frontal inferior orbital in PD patients with persistent pain, with greater activity bilaterally in the cerebellum and in the right inferior temporal areas. Only PD patients with persistent pain showed an accumbens-hippocampus disconnection without white matter and subcortical alterations.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWe showed that persistent pain in PD is associated with supraspinal structural and functional changes. We also highlighted the contribution of frontal, prefrontal, and insular areas in nociceptive modulation and accumbens-hippocampus disconnection. \u00a9 2016 International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society.","authors":[{"name":"Andrea Polli"},{"name":"Luca Weis"},{"name":"Roberta Biundo"},{"name":"Michael Thacker"},{"name":"Andrea Turolla"},{"name":"Kostantinos Koutsikos"},{"name":"K.

Variability in volume was high for all structures examined. When adjusted for a 9% larger total cerebral volume in males, there were no significant volume differences between sexes. However, sex-specific maturational changes were noted in the volumes of medial temporal structures, with the left amygdala increasing significantly only in males and with the right hippocampus increasing significantly only in females. Right-greater-than-left laterality effects were found for temporal lobe, superior temporal gyrus, amygdala, and hippocampal volumes. These results are consistent with previous preclinical and human studies that have indicated hormonal responsivity of these structures and extend quantitative morphologic findings from the adult literature. In addition to highlighting the need for large samples and sex-matched controls in pediatric neuroimaging studies, the information from this understudied age group may be of use in evaluating developmental hypotheses of neuropsychiatric disorders.","authors":[{"name":"Jay N.

The memory impaired PD patients had smaller hippocampi than other PD patients. The performance of PD patients in spatial working memory and attentional set-shifting correlated with the severity of motor defect, and not with hippocampal atrophy. Our results suggests that failure of verbal/visual memory may be related to hippocampal atrophy in Parkinson's disease. On the contrast, the defect in spatial working memory and attentional set-shifting may be sensitive to dysfunction of 'fronto-striatal' systems in PD patients.","authors":[{"name":"P Jr Riekkinen"},{"name":"K Kejonen"},{"name":"M P Laakso"},{"name":"H Soininen"},{"name":"K Partanen"},{"name":"M Riekkinen"}],"cluster":1,"date":"1998/05/11","id":"p7aadcd192c6b13f2","ring0":[],"ring1":[],"ring2":["p0efa1235d81453d8","p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b","padc524ddda484d04","pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8","pd95669bdd96047e4","pe79b3fc6b2f4c642","p3adb19dfff6f7898","p66b5b5e2afa23902","p36921b93f40c4161","p25066a75ce048c92","pbf5741583ce566a5","pd3d518b425c63c44","pc02d5774cf74a770"],"ring3":["p8d944f8de99287e1","p03357fdbc3285a1f","p4c71bbe7d05a72ef","pcba779ac0ec2c700","p0bf3d570e5f3350d","pa9238aa0a5f56f7f","pf37dc76323f6c28a","p5c9433861db6048e","pd9e19bca2600b2b3","p44489f4856976977","p48552e3cf5a7d428","p76d4e9088134dc50","pcb9c19017550a5b0","pd28c36a66168d75d","p25728be31519b600","pc00b3c65b5287be0","pf0a92ee32f8d2420","p0a9650062ef6b287","p225cc835ad930b3b"],"rings":[[],[],["p0efa1235d81453d8","p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b","padc524ddda484d04","pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8","pd95669bdd96047e4","pe79b3fc6b2f4c642","p3adb19dfff6f7898","p66b5b5e2afa23902","p36921b93f40c4161","p25066a75ce048c92","pbf5741583ce566a5","pd3d518b425c63c44","pc02d5774cf74a770"],["p8d944f8de99287e1","p03357fdbc3285a1f","p4c71bbe7d05a72ef","pcba779ac0ec2c700","p0bf3d570e5f3350d","pa9238aa0a5f56f7f","pf37dc76323f6c28a","p5c9433861db6048e","pd9e19bca2600b2b3","p44489f4856976977","p48552e3cf5a7d428","p76d4e9088134dc50","pcb9c19017550a5b0","pd28c36a66168d75d","p25728be31519b600","pc00b3c65b5287be0","pf0a92ee32f8d2420","p0a9650062ef6b287","p225cc835ad930b3b"]],"similarity_matrix":{"p03357fdbc3285a1f":0.20437911902945438,"p0a9650062ef6b287":0.13122122353378182,"p0bf3d570e5f3350d":0.0917222788609948,"p0efa1235d81453d8":0.3250343381234713,"p225cc835ad930b3b":0.19883750887630913,"p25066a75ce048c92":0.2530494592749065,"p25728be31519b600":0.19129750625883096,"p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b":0.3892142168957805,"p36921b93f40c4161":0.3055869189599392,"p3adb19dfff6f7898":0.3211037638766886,"p44489f4856976977":0.10238903896761911,"p48552e3cf5a7d428":0.11931221497832055,"p4c71bbe7d05a72ef":0.1876516749860914,"p5c9433861db6048e":0.20041526287111838,"p66b5b5e2afa23902":0.3248208295141163,"p76d4e9088134dc50":0.2197926589412625,"p8d944f8de99287e1":0.22289030798718745,"pa9238aa0a5f56f7f":0.134959720210975,"padc524ddda484d04":0.364331027900264,"pbf5741583ce566a5":0.3589240415161493,"pc00b3c65b5287be0":0.05654848588307319,"pc02d5774cf74a770":0.3658018192967084,"pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8":0.28171978708289047,"pcb9c19017550a5b0":0.19484090152237646,"pcba779ac0ec2c700":0.2155153823775109,"pd28c36a66168d75d":0.11211557320759295,"pd3d518b425c63c44":0.31377879670250036,"pd95669bdd96047e4":0.2909526090109453,"pd9e19bca2600b2b3":0.2330403461437944,"pe79b3fc6b2f4c642":0.34274343075436203,"pf0a92ee32f8d2420":0.19885134875998775,"pf37dc76323f6c28a":0.18382849088648362},"similarity_ring":{"p03357fdbc3285a1f":3,"p0a9650062ef6b287":3,"p0bf3d570e5f3350d":3,"p0efa1235d81453d8":2,"p225cc835ad930b3b":3,"p25066a75ce048c92":2,"p25728be31519b600":3,"p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b":2,"p36921b93f40c4161":2,"p3adb19dfff6f7898":2,"p44489f4856976977":3,"p48552e3cf5a7d428":3,"p4c71bbe7d05a72ef":3,"p5c9433861db6048e":3,"p66b5b5e2afa23902":2,"p76d4e9088134dc50":3,"p8d944f8de99287e1":3,"pa9238aa0a5f56f7f":3,"padc524ddda484d04":2,"pbf5741583ce566a5":2,"pc00b3c65b5287be0":3,"pc02d5774cf74a770":2,"pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8":2,"pcb9c19017550a5b0":3,"pcba779ac0ec2c700":3,"pd28c36a66168d75d":3,"pd3d518b425c63c44":2,"pd95669bdd96047e4":2,"pd9e19bca2600b2b3":3,"pe79b3fc6b2f4c642":2,"pf0a92ee32f8d2420":3,"pf37dc76323f6c28a":3},"similarity_values":[0.3250343381234713,0.22289030798718745,0.20437911902945438,0.1876516749860914,0.2155153823775109,0.0917222788609948,0.134959720210975,0.9999999999999982,0.3892142168957805,0.18382849088648362,0.20041526287111838,0.364331027900264,0.2330403461437944,0.28171978708289047,0.2909526090109453,0.34274343075436203,0.3211037638766886,0.3248208295141163,0.10238903896761911,0.11931221497832055,0.2197926589412625,0.19484090152237646,0.3055869189599392,0.2530494592749065,0.11211557320759295,0.19129750625883096,0.05654848588307319,0.19885134875998775,0.3589240415161493,0.31377879670250036,0.3658018192967084,0.13122122353378182,0.19883750887630913],"title":"Hippocampal atrophy is related to impaired memory, but not frontal functions in non-demented Parkinson's disease patients","value":12},{"abstract":"Hippocampal atrophy detected by volumetric MRI is a sensitive feature of early Alzheimer's disease (AD), but there are no studies evaluating hippocampal atrophy by MR volumetry in other dementing diseases. We therefore compared hippocampal volumes in a total of 113 subjects: 50 patients with mild to moderate AD, 9 patients with vascular dementia (VaD), 12 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) without dementia, 8 patients with PD and dementia (PDD), and 34 elderly control subjects. Thin, coronal, contiguous images were obtained by a 1.5-T MR imager. All patient groups had significantly smaller volumes of the hippocampus compared with the control group. In the PDD group, the absolute volumes were even smaller than in the AD group. In the PD group, the volumes were diminished to a lesser but significant extent. The volumes in the VaD group varied: of nine patients, two had no atrophy, three had unilateral, and four had bilateral atrophy. We postulate that hippocampal atrophy does not seem to be a specific phenomenon of dementia in AD but also occurs in VaD and PDD, and even in PD when no dementia is present. However, coexistence of AD pathology in our PD and VaD patients cannot be ruled out. Further studies with access to neuropathologic data are needed.","authors":[{"name":"M. P. Laakso"},{"name":"K.

Currently, with the exception of individuals with genetic mutations, postmortem examination of brain tissue remains the only definitive means of establishing diagnosis in most cases, however, structural neuroimaging, in combination with clinical assessment, has value in improving diagnostic accuracy during life. Beyond the exclusion of surgical pathology, signal change and cerebral atrophy visible on structural MRI can be used to identify diagnostically relevant imaging features, which provide support for clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias. While no structural imaging feature has perfect sensitivity and specificity for a given diagnosis, there are a number of imaging characteristics which provide positive predictive value and help to narrow the differential diagnosis. While neuroradiological expertise is invaluable in accurate scan interpretation, there is much that a non-radiologist can gain from a focused and structured approach to scan analysis.

For example, DTI may be used for the diagnosis and differentiation of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) from other neurodegenerative diseases with similar imaging findings and clinical symptoms and signs. The goal of the current study was to identify and analyze recently published series on the use of DTI as a diagnostic tool. Moreover, the authors also explored the utility of DTI in identifying patients with iNPH who could be managed by surgical intervention. METHODS The authors performed a literature search of the PubMed database by using any possible combinations of the following terms: 'Alzheimer's disease,' 'brain,' 'cerebrospinal fluid,' 'CSF,' 'diffusion tensor imaging,' 'DTI,' 'hydrocephalus,' 'idiopathic,' 'magnetic resonance imaging,' 'normal pressure,' 'Parkinson's disease,' and 'shunting.' Moreover, all reference lists from the retrieved articles were reviewed to identify any additional pertinent articles. RESULTS The literature search retrieved 19 studies in which DTI was used for the identification and differentiation of iNPH from other neurodegenerative diseases. The DTI protocols involved different approaches, such as region of interest (ROI) methods, tract-based spatial statistics, voxel-based analysis, and delta-ADC analysis. The most studied anatomical regions were the periventricular WM areas, such as the internal capsule (IC), the corticospinal tract (CST), and the corpus callosum (CC). Patients with iNPH had significantly higher MD in the periventricular WM areas of the CST and the CC than had healthy controls. In addition, FA and ADCs were significantly higher in the CST of iNPH patients than in any other patients with other neurodegenerative diseases. Gait abnormalities of iNPH patients were statistically significantly and negatively correlated with FA in the CST and the minor forceps. Fractional anisotropy had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 80% for diagnosing iNPH. Furthermore, FA and MD values in the CST, the IC, the anterior thalamic region, the fornix, and the hippocampus regions could help differentiate iNPH from Alzheimer or Parkinson disease. Interestingly, CSF drainage or ventriculoperitoneal shunting significantly modified FA and ADCs in iNPH patients whose condition clinically responded to these maneuvers. CONCLUSIONS Measurements of FA and MD significantly contribute to the detection of axonal loss and gliosis in the periventricular WM areas in patients with iNPH. Diffusion tensor imaging may also represent a valuable noninvasive method for differentiating iNPH from other neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, DTI can detect dynamic changes in the WM tracts after lumbar drainage or shunting procedures and could help identify iNPH patients who may benefit from surgical intervention.","authors":[{"name":"Ioannis Siasios"},{"name":"Eftychia Z.

We compared hippocampal, and extra-hippocampal volumes between PD, PDD (patients with PD who have mild cognitive impairment or dementia), Alzheimer's disease (AD) and controls using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants (10 patients with PD, 10 with PDD, 11 with AD, and 12 control subjects) had an informant interview, neurological examination, and psychometric testing. Established, reliable methods were used to measure the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal, frontal, and parieto-occipital lobes. Correction for intracranial volume was carried out before comparison. There was no age difference between groups (mean age, 74 years). On the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) cognitive impairment was mild (CDR = 0.5) in the majority of PDD and AD patients. Hippocampal (P < 0.0004) volumes were smaller in the patient groups. Effect sizes compared with the control group were: PD, 0.66; PDD, 1.22; and AD, 1.81. The other volumes did not differ significantly. Among PD and PDD patients, recognition memory (r = 0.54, P = 0.015) and Mini-Mental State Examination scores (r = 0.56, P = 0.01) correlated with left, but not right hippocampal volume.

We computed individual subject expression values for ADRP and PDCP in 89 patients with PD and correlated summary scores for cognitive functioning with network expression. We also evaluated changes in ADRP and PDCP expression in a separate group of 15 patients with PD scanned serially over a 4-year period.\n\nRESULTS:\nAnalysis revealed a significant AD-related metabolic topography characterized by covarying metabolic reductions in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and parietal and temporal association regions. Expression of ADRP, but not PDCP, was elevated in both AD groups and correlated with worse cognitive summary scores. Patients with PD showed slight ADRP expression, due to topographic overlap with the network underlying PD motor-related pattern degeneration, but only their PDCP expression values increased as cognitive function and executive performance declined. Longitudinal data in PD disclosed an analogous dissociation of network expression.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nCognitive dysfunction in PD is associated with a specific brain network that is largely spatially and functionally distinct from that seen in relation to AD.","authors":[{"name":"Paul J.

Voxel-based morphometric analysis of magnetic resonance images can contribute to in vivo identification of the cerebral regions predominantly involved in PDD.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nTo identify structural cerebral regions most closely related to the presence of PDD.\n\nDESIGN:\nMagnetic resonance images were obtained from 16 patients who had PDD, 13 patients with PD without dementia, and 13 age-matched healthy control subjects. Gray matter volumes were compared using optimized voxel-based morphometric analyses.\n\nRESULTS:\nCompared with healthy controls, patients with PDD showed gray matter volume decreases in several of the following regions: bilateral putamen, accumbens nuclei, left side of the thalamus, bilateral hippocampus, parahippocampal region, and anterior cingulate gyrus. Patients with PD also showed gray matter reductions compared with healthy controls in the right side of the hippocampus, left anterior cingulate gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThe hippocampus, thalamus, and anterior cingulate are the regions most affected in PDD.

dementia compared with Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and to determine whether MTA correlates with cognitive impairment in PD and PD dementia (PDD).\n\nMETHODS:\nCoronal T1-weighted MRI scans were acquired from control subjects (n = 39) and patients with PD (n = 33), PDD (n = 31), DLB (n = 25), and AD (n = 31), diagnosed according to standardized clinical diagnostic criteria. Cognitive function was assessed using the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG), and MTA was rated visually using a standardized (Scheltens) scale.\n\nRESULTS:\nMore severe MTA was seen in PDD (p = 0.007), DLB (p < 0.001), and AD (p < 0.001) vs control subjects. PD subjects had greater hippocampal atrophy than control subjects (p = 0.015) but less than subjects with DLB and AD, though not with PDD. MTA correlated with CAMCOG score and memory scores in the DLB group and with age in control, PDD, and AD groups. There were no correlations between MTA and cognitive impairment in PD, PDD, and AD. PDD and DLB had a similar profile of cognitive impairment and MTA.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nMedial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) was seen in cognitively intact older subjects with Parkinson disease (PD) and was not more pronounced in Parkinson disease dementia (PDD). Alzheimer disease (AD) and, to a lesser extent, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) showed more pronounced MTA. Results suggest early hippocampal involvement in PD and that when dementia develops in PD, anatomic structures apart from the hippocampus are predominantly implicated. Greater hippocampal involvement in AD vs PDD and DLB is consistent with clinical, cognitive, and pathologic differences between the disorders.","authors":[{"name":"C. W. C. Tam"},{"name":"E. J.

In some patients, however, MCI is a more benign condition, which may not progress to AD or may do so slowly.\n\nPATIENTS:\nEighty consecutive patients who met criteria for the diagnosis of MCI were recruited from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's Disease Center/Alzheimer's Disease Patient Registry.\n\nMETHODS:\nAt entry into the study, each patient received an MRI examination of the head, from which the volumes of both hippocampi were measured. Patients were followed longitudinally with approximately annual clinical/cognitive assessments. The primary endpoint was the crossover of individual MCI patients to the clinical diagnosis of AD during longitudinal clinical follow-up.\n\nRESULTS:\nDuring the period of longitudinal observation, which averaged 32.6 months, 27 of the 80 MCI patients became demented. Hippocampal atrophy at baseline was associated with crossover from MCI to AD (relative risk [RR], 0.69, p = 0.015). When hippocampal volume was entered into bivariate models-using age, postmenopausal estrogen replacement, standard neuropsychological tests, apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype, history of ischemic heart disease, and hypertension-the RRs were not substantially different from that found univariately, and the associations between hippocampal volume and crossover remained significant.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nIn older patients with MCI, hippocampal atrophy determined by premorbid MRI-based volume measurements is predictive of subsequent conversion to AD.","authors":[{"name":"C.

We tested the hypothesis that hippocampal N-acetyl aspartate (NAA: a neuronal marker) and volume used together provide greater discrimination between AD and normal elderly than does either measure alone. We used proton MR spectroscopic imaging (1H MRSI) and tissue segmented and volumetric MR images to measure atrophy-corrected hippocampal NAA and volumes in 12 AD patients (mild to moderate severity) and 17 control subjects of comparable age. In AD, atrophy-corrected NAA from the hippocampal region was reduced by 15.5% on the right and 16.2% on the left (both p < 0.003), and hippocampal volumes were smaller by 20.1% (p < 0.003) on the right and 21.8% (p < 0.001) on the left when compared with control subjects. The NAA reductions and volume losses made independent contributions to the discrimination of AD patients from control subjects. When used separately, neither hippocampal NAA nor volume achieved to classify correctly AD patients better than 80%. When used together, however, the two measures correctly classified 90% of AD patients and 94% of control subjects. In conclusion, hippocampal NAA measured by 1H MRSI combined with quantitative measurements of hippocampal atrophy by MRI may improve diagnosis of AD.","authors":[{"name":"N. Schuff"},{"name":"D.

We recently described our findings that atrophy of the entorhinal cortex (ERC) in frontotemporal dementia (FTD) is equal to that found in AD but that hippocampal atrophy in FTD is less than that found in AD. The MRI volumes of these structures provide a topographic representation of the region of interest. We hypothesized that two different dementias with distinct histopathologic and clinical features might, in addition to quantitative patterns, display topographically different patterns of atrophy.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe adopted a morphometric approach to monitor the pattern of atrophy of the hippocampus and the ERC by computing two-dimensional profiles from MRI volumes of the structures in control subjects and patients with FTD and AD.\n\nRESULTS:\nCompared with control subjects, atrophy of the hippocampus in patients with AD was diffuse. In patients with FTD, atrophy of the hippocampus was localized predominantly in the anterior hippocampus, suggesting a different pattern of hippocampal atrophy in FTD compared with AD. The amount and pattern of atrophy of the entorhinal cortex was virtually equal in both demented groups.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThis study provides novel data on the nature of medial temporal lobe atrophy in FTD.

We wished to estimate the effect of magnetic resonance image (MRI) spatial orientation on manual hippocampal segmentations to define optimal standard orientation of MRIs for hippocampal volumetry.\n\nMETHODS:\nThree expert tracers segmented twice the hippocampi of 10 ADNI subjects on MRI slices oriented perpendicular to the anterior-posterior commissure (AC-PC) line and the long hippocampal axes plane, following internationally harmonized landmarks. We computed intra and interrater reliability figures for total volumes and similarity coefficients.\n\nRESULTS:\nTotal volume reliability was similar for both orientations. Similarity coefficients were significantly higher for the AC-PC orientation (exact P = 0.002).\n\nDISCUSSION:\nThese data show that AC-PC orientation is slightly more reliable for manual segmentations, possibly due to better visualization of the cerebrospinal fluid spaces separating hippocampal head and amygdala. A Delphi panel of experts has used these data to decide on the optimal orientation for a Harmonized Protocol for hippocampal segmentation.","authors":[{"name":"Marina Boccardi"},{"name":"Martina Bocchetta"},{"name":"Liana G.

According to the new guidelines Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves not only dementia's phase but also predementia phase which is asymptomatic and pathological process in the brain is already present. For this reason it is very important to determine the suitability of markers which should be positive before onset of the first symptoms. One of these biomarkers is a structural magnetic resonance imaging with hippocampal volumetric assessment.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of structural brain magnetic resonance imaging with volumetric assessment of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal gyri: superior, medial and inferior, to predict the conversion of MCI to AD.\n\nMaterial and methods\nMagnetic resonance imaging of brain was performed at the baseline visit in 101 patients diagnosed with MCI. Clinic follow-ups were scheduled after 6.12 and 24 months.\n\nResults\nAmongst 101 patients with MCI, 17 (16.8%) converted into AD within two years of observation. All measured volumes were lower in converters than non-converters. Discriminant analysis was conducted and sensitivity for MCI conversion to AD was 64.7%, specificity 96.4%. 91% of patients were correctly classified (converter or non-converter).\n\nConclusions\nVolumetric measurements may help clinicians to predict MCI conversion to AD but due to low sensitivity it cannot be use separately. The study group requires further observation.","authors":[{"name":"Marta Nesteruk"},{"name":"Tomasz Nesteruk"},{"name":"Maria Styczy\u0144ska"},{"name":"Anna Barczak"},{"name":"Monika Mandecka"},{"name":"Jerzy Walecki"},{"name":"Maria Barcikowska-Kotowicz"}],"cluster":1,"date":"2015/01/01","id":"p76d4e9088134dc50","ring0":[],"ring1":[],"ring2":["p0efa1235d81453d8","p8d944f8de99287e1","pcba779ac0ec2c700","pa9238aa0a5f56f7f","p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b","pf37dc76323f6c28a","padc524ddda484d04","pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8","pd95669bdd96047e4","pe79b3fc6b2f4c642","p3adb19dfff6f7898","p66b5b5e2afa23902","p36921b93f40c4161","p25066a75ce048c92","pf0a92ee32f8d2420","pbf5741583ce566a5","pd3d518b425c63c44","pc02d5774cf74a770","p225cc835ad930b3b"],"ring3":["p03357fdbc3285a1f","p4c71bbe7d05a72ef","p0bf3d570e5f3350d","p7aadcd192c6b13f2","p5c9433861db6048e","pd9e19bca2600b2b3","p44489f4856976977","p48552e3cf5a7d428","pcb9c19017550a5b0","pd28c36a66168d75d","p25728be31519b600","pc00b3c65b5287be0","p0a9650062ef6b287"],"rings":[[],[],["p0efa1235d81453d8","p8d944f8de99287e1","pcba779ac0ec2c700","pa9238aa0a5f56f7f","p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b","pf37dc76323f6c28a","padc524ddda484d04","pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8","pd95669bdd96047e4","pe79b3fc6b2f4c642","p3adb19dfff6f7898","p66b5b5e2afa23902","p36921b93f40c4161","p25066a75ce048c92","pf0a92ee32f8d2420","pbf5741583ce566a5","pd3d518b425c63c44","pc02d5774cf74a770","p225cc835ad930b3b"],["p03357fdbc3285a1f","p4c71bbe7d05a72ef","p0bf3d570e5f3350d","p7aadcd192c6b13f2","p5c9433861db6048e","pd9e19bca2600b2b3","p44489f4856976977","p48552e3cf5a7d428","pcb9c19017550a5b0","pd28c36a66168d75d","p25728be31519b600","pc00b3c65b5287be0","p0a9650062ef6b287"]],"similarity_matrix":{"p03357fdbc3285a1f":0.2414112177281876,"p0a9650062ef6b287":0.18178367855254035,"p0bf3d570e5f3350d":0.11092168417780784,"p0efa1235d81453d8":0.3671497898082124,"p225cc835ad930b3b":0.41483850991295546,"p25066a75ce048c92":0.40797013233151025,"p25728be31519b600":0.2498888130484684,"p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b":0.33887785340317855,"p36921b93f40c4161":0.35715087129254347,"p3adb19dfff6f7898":0.34954242601941127,"p44489f4856976977":0.15949630213756893,"p48552e3cf5a7d428":0.2055862304395029,"p4c71bbe7d05a72ef":0.13791356685913198,"p5c9433861db6048e":0.19540798192274556,"p66b5b5e2afa23902":0.31748979786263704,"p7aadcd192c6b13f2":0.2197926589412625,"p8d944f8de99287e1":0.29984458222185123,"pa9238aa0a5f56f7f":0.2663360668353687,"padc524ddda484d04":0.35994218961927504,"pbf5741583ce566a5":0.48026073376101885,"pc00b3c65b5287be0":0.07059319353255303,"pc02d5774cf74a770":0.4122880808441995,"pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8":0.3607798692863863,"pcb9c19017550a5b0":0.2301807032868406,"pcba779ac0ec2c700":0.29767944668090257,"pd28c36a66168d75d":0.11518794799624148,"pd3d518b425c63c44":0.36567660451575656,"pd95669bdd96047e4":0.2995395123712921,"pd9e19bca2600b2b3":0.24565169306621915,"pe79b3fc6b2f4c642":0.2703495389761315,"pf0a92ee32f8d2420":0.25272729977776515,"pf37dc76323f6c28a":0.27859314755234404},"similarity_ring":{"p03357fdbc3285a1f":3,"p0a9650062ef6b287":3,"p0bf3d570e5f3350d":3,"p0efa1235d81453d8":2,"p225cc835ad930b3b":2,"p25066a75ce048c92":2,"p25728be31519b600":3,"p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b":2,"p36921b93f40c4161":2,"p3adb19dfff6f7898":2,"p44489f4856976977":3,"p48552e3cf5a7d428":3,"p4c71bbe7d05a72ef":3,"p5c9433861db6048e":3,"p66b5b5e2afa23902":2,"p7aadcd192c6b13f2":3,"p8d944f8de99287e1":2,"pa9238aa0a5f56f7f":2,"padc524ddda484d04":2,"pbf5741583ce566a5":2,"pc00b3c65b5287be0":3,"pc02d5774cf74a770":2,"pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8":2,"pcb9c19017550a5b0":3,"pcba779ac0ec2c700":2,"pd28c36a66168d75d":3,"pd3d518b425c63c44":2,"pd95669bdd96047e4":2,"pd9e19bca2600b2b3":3,"pe79b3fc6b2f4c642":2,"pf0a92ee32f8d2420":2,"pf37dc76323f6c28a":2},"similarity_values":[0.3671497898082124,0.29984458222185123,0.2414112177281876,0.13791356685913198,0.29767944668090257,0.11092168417780784,0.2663360668353687,0.2197926589412625,0.33887785340317855,0.27859314755234404,0.19540798192274556,0.35994218961927504,0.24565169306621915,0.3607798692863863,0.2995395123712921,0.2703495389761315,0.34954242601941127,0.31748979786263704,0.15949630213756893,0.2055862304395029,0.9999999999999979,0.2301807032868406,0.35715087129254347,0.40797013233151025,0.11518794799624148,0.2498888130484684,0.07059319353255303,0.25272729977776515,0.48026073376101885,0.36567660451575656,0.4122880808441995,0.18178367855254035,0.41483850991295546],"title":"Predicting the conversion of mild cognitive impairment to Alzheimer's disease based on the volumetric measurements of the selected brain structures in magnetic resonance imaging","value":26},{"abstract":"OBJECTIVE:\nAlthough Parkinson's disease (PD) is frequently accompanied by depression, brain perfusion deficits in PD with depression remain unclear. This study aimed to assess alterations in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in depressed PD patients using 99mTc hexamethyl-propylene-amine-oxime single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).\nMETHODS:\nAmong 78 patients with PD, 35 patients were classified into the depressed PD group, while the rest (43 patients) was assigned to the nondepressed PD group based on the scores of the Geriatric Depressive Scale (GDS). All participants underwent brain SPECT imaging. The voxel-wise whole-brain analysis and region-of-interest (ROI) analysis of the limbic areas were conducted to compare rCBF between the depressed and nondepressed PD groups.\nRESULTS:\nThe depressed PD patients demonstrated higher GDS scores than nondepressed patients, whereas between-group differences in the PD severity and cognitive function were not significant. Perfusion in the left cuneus was increased, while that in the right superior temporal gyrus and right medial orbitofrontal cortex was reduced in the depressed PD patients as compared with nondepressed PD patients. In addition, the ROI analysis demonstrated rCBF decreases in the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus in the depressed PD group. A positive correlation was found between the GDS scores and rCBF in the left cuneus cluster in the depressed PD patients.\nCONCLUSION:\nThis study identified the regional pattern of brain perfusion that distinguished depressed from nondepressed PD patients. Hyperperfusion in the occipital areas and hypoperfusion in the fronto-temporo-limbic regions may be potential imaging biomarkers for depression in PD.","authors":[{"name":"Young-Do Kim"},{"name":"Hyeonseok S.

and patients with MCI who convert to AD have greater atrophy in the CA1 hippocampal subfield and subiculum.\n\nDESIGN:\nProspective longitudinal cohort study.\n\nSETTING:\nUniversity of California-Los Angeles Alzheimer's Disease Research Center.\n\nPATIENTS:\nWe followed up 20 MCI subjects clinically and neuropsychologically for 3 years.\n\nMAIN OUTCOME MEASURE:\nBaseline regional hippocampal atrophy was analyzed with region-of-interest and 3-dimensional hippocampal mapping techniques.\n\nRESULTS:\nDuring the 3-year study, 6 patients developed AD (MCI-c), 7 remained stable (MCI-nc), and 7 improved (MCI-i). Patients with MCI-c had 9% smaller left and 13% smaller right mean hippocampal volumes compared with MCI-nc patients. Radial atrophy maps showed greater atrophy of the CA1 subregion in MCI-c. Patients with MCI-c had significantly smaller hippocampi than MCI-i patients (left, 24%; right, 27%). Volumetric analyses showed a trend for greater hippocampal atrophy in MCI-nc relative to MCI-i patients (eg, 16% volume loss). After permutation tests corrected for multiple comparison, the atrophy maps showed a significant difference on the right. Subicular differences were seen between MCI-c and MCI-i patients, and MCI-nc and MCI-i patients. Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed the group effect to be highly significant and independent of age, hemisphere, and Mini-Mental State Examination scores at baseline.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nSmaller hippocampi and specifically CA1 and subicular involvement are associated with increased risk for conversion from MCI to AD. Patients with MCI-i tend to have larger hippocampal volumes and relative preservation of both the subiculum and CA1.","authors":[{"name":"Liana G. Apostolova"},{"name":"Rebecca A.

However, in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the results are inconsistent. Moreover, the left-right asymmetry of the hippocampus receives less research attention. In this article, meta-analyses are designed to determine the extent of hippocampal atrophy in MCI and AD, and to evaluate the asymmetry pattern of the hippocampal volume in control, MCI, and AD groups. From 14 studies including 365 MCI patients and 382 controls, significant atrophy is found in both the left [Effect size (ES), 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.72-1.11] and right (ES, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.57-0.98) hippocampus, which is lower than that in AD (ES, 1.60, 95% CI, 1.37-1.84, in left; ES, 1.52, 95% CI, 1.31-1.72, in right). Comparing with aging controls, the average volume reduction weighted by sample size is 12.9% and 11.1% in left and right hippocampus in MCI, and 24.2% and 23.1% in left and right hippocampus in AD, respectively. The findings show a bilateral hippocampal volume loss in MCI and the extent of atrophy is less than that in AD. By comparing the left and right hippocampal volume, a consistent left-less-than-right asymmetry pattern is found, but with different extents in control (ES, 0.39), MCI (ES, 0.56), and AD (ES, 0.30) group.","authors":[{"name":"Feng Shi"},{"name":"Bing Liu"},{"name":"Yuan Zhou"},{"name":"Chunshui Yu"},{"name":"Tianzi Jiang"}],"cluster":1,"date":"2009/11/01","id":"p25066a75ce048c92","ring0":[],"ring1":["pf0a92ee32f8d2420","pc02d5774cf74a770"],"ring2":["p0efa1235d81453d8","p8d944f8de99287e1","p03357fdbc3285a1f","pcba779ac0ec2c700","pa9238aa0a5f56f7f","p7aadcd192c6b13f2","p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b","padc524ddda484d04","pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8","pd95669bdd96047e4","pe79b3fc6b2f4c642","p3adb19dfff6f7898","p66b5b5e2afa23902","p76d4e9088134dc50","pcb9c19017550a5b0","p36921b93f40c4161","pbf5741583ce566a5","pd3d518b425c63c44","p225cc835ad930b3b"],"ring3":["p4c71bbe7d05a72ef","p0bf3d570e5f3350d","pf37dc76323f6c28a","p5c9433861db6048e","pd9e19bca2600b2b3","p44489f4856976977","p48552e3cf5a7d428","pd28c36a66168d75d","p25728be31519b600","pc00b3c65b5287be0","p0a9650062ef6b287"],"rings":[[],["pf0a92ee32f8d2420","pc02d5774cf74a770"],["p0efa1235d81453d8","p8d944f8de99287e1","p03357fdbc3285a1f","pcba779ac0ec2c700","pa9238aa0a5f56f7f","p7aadcd192c6b13f2","p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b","padc524ddda484d04","pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8","pd95669bdd96047e4","pe79b3fc6b2f4c642","p3adb19dfff6f7898","p66b5b5e2afa23902","p76d4e9088134dc50","pcb9c19017550a5b0","p36921b93f40c4161","pbf5741583ce566a5","pd3d518b425c63c44","p225cc835ad930b3b"],["p4c71bbe7d05a72ef","p0bf3d570e5f3350d","pf37dc76323f6c28a","p5c9433861db6048e","pd9e19bca2600b2b3","p44489f4856976977","p48552e3cf5a7d428","pd28c36a66168d75d","p25728be31519b600","pc00b3c65b5287be0","p0a9650062ef6b287"]],"similarity_matrix":{"p03357fdbc3285a1f":0.27418122453834526,"p0a9650062ef6b287":0.2245891785050641,"p0bf3d570e5f3350d":0.11380311682493964,"p0efa1235d81453d8":0.4474577842878254,"p225cc835ad930b3b":0.3600761468208726,"p25728be31519b600":0.2058931462384687,"p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b":0.46894594090013025,"p36921b93f40c4161":0.4096738653653146,"p3adb19dfff6f7898":0.461740757343849,"p44489f4856976977":0.1774341778593991,"p48552e3cf5a7d428":0.18598241919544067,"p4c71bbe7d05a72ef":0.18629856216804624,"p5c9433861db6048e":0.21902312750214337,"p66b5b5e2afa23902":0.45720126147630974,"p76d4e9088134dc50":0.40797013233151025,"p7aadcd192c6b13f2":0.2530494592749065,"p8d944f8de99287e1":0.3808668132570669,"pa9238aa0a5f56f7f":0.2988709141602783,"padc524ddda484d04":0.46904538602806495,"pbf5741583ce566a5":0.4718502317067635,"pc00b3c65b5287be0":0.06662493079789235,"pc02d5774cf74a770":0.5028883708497182,"pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8":0.38416739857909143,"pcb9c19017550a5b0":0.26138637546711263,"pcba779ac0ec2c700":0.34563538440384084,"pd28c36a66168d75d":0.20113864715286633,"pd3d518b425c63c44":0.43514310280622337,"pd95669bdd96047e4":0.3704262149402524,"pd9e19bca2600b2b3":0.24828435546877714,"pe79b3fc6b2f4c642":0.293683298957791,"pf0a92ee32f8d2420":0.5444826910972886,"pf37dc76323f6c28a":0.24529589601343554},"similarity_ring":{"p03357fdbc3285a1f":2,"p0a9650062ef6b287":3,"p0bf3d570e5f3350d":3,"p0efa1235d81453d8":2,"p225cc835ad930b3b":2,"p25728be31519b600":3,"p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b":2,"p36921b93f40c4161":2,"p3adb19dfff6f7898":2,"p44489f4856976977":3,"p48552e3cf5a7d428":3,"p4c71bbe7d05a72ef":3,"p5c9433861db6048e":3,"p66b5b5e2afa23902":2,"p76d4e9088134dc50":2,"p7aadcd192c6b13f2":2,"p8d944f8de99287e1":2,"pa9238aa0a5f56f7f":2,"padc524ddda484d04":2,"pbf5741583ce566a5":2,"pc00b3c65b5287be0":3,"pc02d5774cf74a770":1,"pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8":2,"pcb9c19017550a5b0":2,"pcba779ac0ec2c700":2,"pd28c36a66168d75d":3,"pd3d518b425c63c44":2,"pd95669bdd96047e4":2,"pd9e19bca2600b2b3":3,"pe79b3fc6b2f4c642":2,"pf0a92ee32f8d2420":1,"pf37dc76323f6c28a":3},"similarity_values":[0.4474577842878254,0.3808668132570669,0.27418122453834526,0.18629856216804624,0.34563538440384084,0.11380311682493964,0.2988709141602783,0.2530494592749065,0.46894594090013025,0.24529589601343554,0.21902312750214337,0.46904538602806495,0.24828435546877714,0.38416739857909143,0.3704262149402524,0.293683298957791,0.461740757343849,0.45720126147630974,0.1774341778593991,0.18598241919544067,0.40797013233151025,0.26138637546711263,0.4096738653653146,1.0000000000000033,0.20113864715286633,0.2058931462384687,0.06662493079789235,0.5444826910972886,0.4718502317067635,0.43514310280622337,0.5028883708497182,0.2245891785050641,0.3600761468208726],"title":"Hippocampal Volume and Asymmetry in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease: Meta-Analyses of MRI Studies","value":30},{"abstract":"Eleven susceptibility loci for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD) were identified by previous studies; however, a large portion of the genetic risk for this disease remains unexplained. We conducted a large, two-stage meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in individuals of European ancestry. In stage 1, we used genotyped and imputed data (7,055,881 SNPs) to perform meta-analysis on 4 previously published GWAS data sets consisting of 17,008 Alzheimer's disease cases and 37,154 controls. In stage 2, 11,632 SNPs were genotyped and tested for association in an independent set of 8,572 Alzheimer's disease cases and 11,312 controls. In addition to the APOE locus (encoding apolipoprotein E), 19 loci reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 \u00d7 10(-8)) in the combined stage 1 and stage 2 analysis, of which 11 are newly associated with Alzheimer's disease.","authors":[{"name":"Jean-Charles Lambert"},{"name":"Carla A.

The possibility of disease-modifying strategies has evoked a need for early and accurate diagnosis. To improve the accuracy of the clinical diagnosis of AD, biomarkers like cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and neuroimaging techniques like magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) have been incorporated into the diagnostic guidelines of AD.\n\nCase presentation\nIn this case report we outline in reference to one of our patients with presenile dementia the current approaches to the diagnosis of AD. The patient was a 59-year old woman presenting with progressive memory decline. CSF-A\u03b242 was normal while P-tau was slightly increased. FDG-PET indicated a pattern typical for AD, amyloid-PET showed an extensive global amyloid load, and tau-PET depicted a pronounced hippocampal tracer accumulation. The MRI scan was rated as normal at routine diagnostics, however quantitative volumetric analysis revealed significant atrophy especially of the parietal lobe. The combination of biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques was therefore suggestive of an underlying AD pathology.\n\nConclusions\nTo enable early and accurate diagnosis of AD and thereby also patient recruitment for anti-tau or anti-\u03b2-amyloid therapeutic trials, a combination of biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques seems useful.","authors":[{"name":"Sonja Sch\u00f6necker"},{"name":"Matthias Brendel"},{"name":"Marion Huber"},{"name":"Christian Vollmar"},{"name":"Hans-Juergen Huppertz"},{"name":"Stefan Teipel"},{"name":"Nobuyuki Okamura"},{"name":"Johannes Levin"},{"name":"Axel Rominger"},{"name":"Adrian Danek"}],"cluster":2,"date":"2016/08/09","id":"p25728be31519b600","ring0":[],"ring1":[],"ring2":["p0efa1235d81453d8","p8d944f8de99287e1","p03357fdbc3285a1f","pcba779ac0ec2c700","p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b","pf37dc76323f6c28a","padc524ddda484d04","pd9e19bca2600b2b3","pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8","pd95669bdd96047e4","p3adb19dfff6f7898","p66b5b5e2afa23902","p48552e3cf5a7d428","pbf5741583ce566a5","pd3d518b425c63c44","pc02d5774cf74a770","p225cc835ad930b3b"],"ring3":["p4c71bbe7d05a72ef","p0bf3d570e5f3350d","pa9238aa0a5f56f7f","p7aadcd192c6b13f2","p5c9433861db6048e","pe79b3fc6b2f4c642","p44489f4856976977","p76d4e9088134dc50","pcb9c19017550a5b0","p36921b93f40c4161","p25066a75ce048c92","pd28c36a66168d75d","pc00b3c65b5287be0","pf0a92ee32f8d2420","p0a9650062ef6b287"],"rings":[[],[],["p0efa1235d81453d8","p8d944f8de99287e1","p03357fdbc3285a1f","pcba779ac0ec2c700","p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b","pf37dc76323f6c28a","padc524ddda484d04","pd9e19bca2600b2b3","pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8","pd95669bdd96047e4","p3adb19dfff6f7898","p66b5b5e2afa23902","p48552e3cf5a7d428","pbf5741583ce566a5","pd3d518b425c63c44","pc02d5774cf74a770","p225cc835ad930b3b"],["p4c71bbe7d05a72ef","p0bf3d570e5f3350d","pa9238aa0a5f56f7f","p7aadcd192c6b13f2","p5c9433861db6048e","pe79b3fc6b2f4c642","p44489f4856976977","p76d4e9088134dc50","pcb9c19017550a5b0","p36921b93f40c4161","p25066a75ce048c92","pd28c36a66168d75d","pc00b3c65b5287be0","pf0a92ee32f8d2420","p0a9650062ef6b287"]],"similarity_matrix":{"p03357fdbc3285a1f":0.28449104032006733,"p0a9650062ef6b287":0.15703722696249148,"p0bf3d570e5f3350d":0.0900549816127065,"p0efa1235d81453d8":0.28939283170654334,"p225cc835ad930b3b":0.3334983827658283,"p25066a75ce048c92":0.2058931462384687,"p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b":0.3347404374701566,"p36921b93f40c4161":0.248858646777653,"p3adb19dfff6f7898":0.26859124395337947,"p44489f4856976977":0.1471048971600751,"p48552e3cf5a7d428":0.2961692367428939,"p4c71bbe7d05a72ef":0.11319376703339439,"p5c9433861db6048e":0.22414829887898138,"p66b5b5e2afa23902":0.287982077379933,"p76d4e9088134dc50":0.2498888130484684,"p7aadcd192c6b13f2":0.19129750625883096,"p8d944f8de99287e1":0.31958773881622393,"pa9238aa0a5f56f7f":0.1447724401008834,"padc524ddda484d04":0.34919521769307893,"pbf5741583ce566a5":0.2903568071507211,"pc00b3c65b5287be0":0.07579058914214595,"pc02d5774cf74a770":0.2913563899722423,"pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8":0.33488206870231185,"pcb9c19017550a5b0":0.1726224310787475,"pcba779ac0ec2c700":0.26778564895068313,"pd28c36a66168d75d":0.15096042110472235,"pd3d518b425c63c44":0.3737908383383201,"pd95669bdd96047e4":0.34091381237035123,"pd9e19bca2600b2b3":0.2717747180099963,"pe79b3fc6b2f4c642":0.23074974920774455,"pf0a92ee32f8d2420":0.2069004771739169,"pf37dc76323f6c28a":0.40222047155946866},"similarity_ring":{"p03357fdbc3285a1f":2,"p0a9650062ef6b287":3,"p0bf3d570e5f3350d":3,"p0efa1235d81453d8":2,"p225cc835ad930b3b":2,"p25066a75ce048c92":3,"p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b":2,"p36921b93f40c4161":3,"p3adb19dfff6f7898":2,"p44489f4856976977":3,"p48552e3cf5a7d428":2,"p4c71bbe7d05a72ef":3,"p5c9433861db6048e":3,"p66b5b5e2afa23902":2,"p76d4e9088134dc50":3,"p7aadcd192c6b13f2":3,"p8d944f8de99287e1":2,"pa9238aa0a5f56f7f":3,"padc524ddda484d04":2,"pbf5741583ce566a5":2,"pc00b3c65b5287be0":3,"pc02d5774cf74a770":2,"pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8":2,"pcb9c19017550a5b0":3,"pcba779ac0ec2c700":2,"pd28c36a66168d75d":3,"pd3d518b425c63c44":2,"pd95669bdd96047e4":2,"pd9e19bca2600b2b3":2,"pe79b3fc6b2f4c642":3,"pf0a92ee32f8d2420":3,"pf37dc76323f6c28a":2},"similarity_values":[0.28939283170654334,0.31958773881622393,0.28449104032006733,0.11319376703339439,0.26778564895068313,0.0900549816127065,0.1447724401008834,0.19129750625883096,0.3347404374701566,0.40222047155946866,0.22414829887898138,0.34919521769307893,0.2717747180099963,0.33488206870231185,0.34091381237035123,0.23074974920774455,0.26859124395337947,0.287982077379933,0.1471048971600751,0.2961692367428939,0.2498888130484684,0.1726224310787475,0.248858646777653,0.2058931462384687,0.15096042110472235,0.9999999999999986,0.07579058914214595,0.2069004771739169,0.2903568071507211,0.3737908383383201,0.2913563899722423,0.15703722696249148,0.3334983827658283],"title":"Applied multimodal diagnostics in a case of presenile dementia","value":29},{"abstract":"Mono-glycosylated sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids play important roles in diverse biological processes and are linked to a variety of pathologies, such as Parkinson disease. The precise identification of the carbohydrate head group of these lipids is complicated by their isobaric nature and by substantial differences in concentration in different biological samples. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a zwitterionic (ZIC)-hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry method. ZIC-HILIC preferentially retains inositol, followed by glucose- and galactose-featuring lipids. Comparison with unmodified silica gel HILIC stationary phase revealed different retention specificity. To evaluate the precision of ZIC-HILIC, we quantified glucosyl- (GlcCer) and galactosylceramides (GalCer) in seven different regions of the mouse brain and discovered that GlcCer and GalCer concentrations are inversely related. The highest GalCer (lowest GlcCer) content was found in the medulla oblongata and hippocampus, whereas the highest GlcCer (lowest GalCer) content was found in other regions. With a neutral loss scan, ZIC-HILIC resolved glucosylceramide species featuring non-hydroxylated fatty acid, hydroxylated fatty acid, and trihydroxy sphingoid bases in mouse epidermis samples. This demonstrates that our ZIC-HILIC-based approach is a valuable tool for characterizing the structural diversity of mono-glucosylated lipids in biological material and for quantifying these important lipids.","authors":[{"name":"Kazuki Nakajima"},{"name":"Hisako Akiyama"},{"name":"Kaori Tanaka"},{"name":"Ayako Kohyama-Koganeya"},{"name":"Peter Greimel"},{"name":"Yoshio Hirabayashi"}],"cluster":3,"date":"2016/09/15","id":"pc00b3c65b5287be0","ring0":[],"ring1":[],"ring2":[],"ring3":["p0efa1235d81453d8","p8d944f8de99287e1","p03357fdbc3285a1f","p4c71bbe7d05a72ef","pcba779ac0ec2c700","p0bf3d570e5f3350d","pa9238aa0a5f56f7f","p7aadcd192c6b13f2","p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b","pf37dc76323f6c28a","p5c9433861db6048e","padc524ddda484d04","pd9e19bca2600b2b3","pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8","pd95669bdd96047e4","pe79b3fc6b2f4c642","p3adb19dfff6f7898","p66b5b5e2afa23902","p44489f4856976977","p48552e3cf5a7d428","p76d4e9088134dc50","pcb9c19017550a5b0","p36921b93f40c4161","p25066a75ce048c92","pd28c36a66168d75d","p25728be31519b600","pf0a92ee32f8d2420","pbf5741583ce566a5","pd3d518b425c63c44","pc02d5774cf74a770","p0a9650062ef6b287","p225cc835ad930b3b"],"rings":[[],[],[],["p0efa1235d81453d8","p8d944f8de99287e1","p03357fdbc3285a1f","p4c71bbe7d05a72ef","pcba779ac0ec2c700","p0bf3d570e5f3350d","pa9238aa0a5f56f7f","p7aadcd192c6b13f2","p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b","pf37dc76323f6c28a","p5c9433861db6048e","padc524ddda484d04","pd9e19bca2600b2b3","pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8","pd95669bdd96047e4","pe79b3fc6b2f4c642","p3adb19dfff6f7898","p66b5b5e2afa23902","p44489f4856976977","p48552e3cf5a7d428","p76d4e9088134dc50","pcb9c19017550a5b0","p36921b93f40c4161","p25066a75ce048c92","pd28c36a66168d75d","p25728be31519b600","pf0a92ee32f8d2420","pbf5741583ce566a5","pd3d518b425c63c44","pc02d5774cf74a770","p0a9650062ef6b287","p225cc835ad930b3b"]],"similarity_matrix":{"p03357fdbc3285a1f":0.07191363423003888,"p0a9650062ef6b287":0.09844460615432034,"p0bf3d570e5f3350d":0.030179154599605552,"p0efa1235d81453d8":0.06658419435158888,"p225cc835ad930b3b":0.07473241026815178,"p25066a75ce048c92":0.06662493079789235,"p25728be31519b600":0.07579058914214595,"p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b":0.06207700146352735,"p36921b93f40c4161":0.05707434131978334,"p3adb19dfff6f7898":0.10611648407661002,"p44489f4856976977":0.04851498967605512,"p48552e3cf5a7d428":0.079205883576572,"p4c71bbe7d05a72ef":0.06959461779671418,"p5c9433861db6048e":0.05153801414704363,"p66b5b5e2afa23902":0.07588452936988002,"p76d4e9088134dc50":0.07059319353255303,"p7aadcd192c6b13f2":0.05654848588307319,"p8d944f8de99287e1":0.06417116914551244,"pa9238aa0a5f56f7f":0.07222619920192414,"padc524ddda484d04":0.06586281381120439,"pbf5741583ce566a5":0.0713016321952618,"pc02d5774cf74a770":0.0734233423474883,"pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8":0.07249233427315367,"pcb9c19017550a5b0":0.06231885363587068,"pcba779ac0ec2c700":0.07957387930698302,"pd28c36a66168d75d":0.06842274931398913,"pd3d518b425c63c44":0.058751217863938145,"pd95669bdd96047e4":0.05386683966889022,"pd9e19bca2600b2b3":0.06860051674020883,"pe79b3fc6b2f4c642":0.05240165350815932,"pf0a92ee32f8d2420":0.06542875889135188,"pf37dc76323f6c28a":0.0588282844114329},"similarity_ring":{"p03357fdbc3285a1f":3,"p0a9650062ef6b287":3,"p0bf3d570e5f3350d":3,"p0efa1235d81453d8":3,"p225cc835ad930b3b":3,"p25066a75ce048c92":3,"p25728be31519b600":3,"p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b":3,"p36921b93f40c4161":3,"p3adb19dfff6f7898":3,"p44489f4856976977":3,"p48552e3cf5a7d428":3,"p4c71bbe7d05a72ef":3,"p5c9433861db6048e":3,"p66b5b5e2afa23902":3,"p76d4e9088134dc50":3,"p7aadcd192c6b13f2":3,"p8d944f8de99287e1":3,"pa9238aa0a5f56f7f":3,"padc524ddda484d04":3,"pbf5741583ce566a5":3,"pc02d5774cf74a770":3,"pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8":3,"pcb9c19017550a5b0":3,"pcba779ac0ec2c700":3,"pd28c36a66168d75d":3,"pd3d518b425c63c44":3,"pd95669bdd96047e4":3,"pd9e19bca2600b2b3":3,"pe79b3fc6b2f4c642":3,"pf0a92ee32f8d2420":3,"pf37dc76323f6c28a":3},"similarity_values":[0.06658419435158888,0.06417116914551244,0.07191363423003888,0.06959461779671418,0.07957387930698302,0.030179154599605552,0.07222619920192414,0.05654848588307319,0.06207700146352735,0.0588282844114329,0.05153801414704363,0.06586281381120439,0.06860051674020883,0.07249233427315367,0.05386683966889022,0.05240165350815932,0.10611648407661002,0.07588452936988002,0.04851498967605512,0.079205883576572,0.07059319353255303,0.06231885363587068,0.05707434131978334,0.06662493079789235,0.06842274931398913,0.07579058914214595,1.000000000000002,0.06542875889135188,0.0713016321952618,0.058751217863938145,0.0734233423474883,0.09844460615432034,0.07473241026815178],"title":"Separation and analysis of mono-glucosylated lipids in brain and skin by hydrophilic interaction chromatography based on carbohydrate and lipid moiety","value":25},{"abstract":"Hippocampal atrophy rates are useful in both diagnosing and tracking Alzheimer's disease (AD).

In this study, we compared MRI-derived entorhinal and hippocampal volume in healthy elderly controls, patients who presented at the clinic with cognitive complaints, but did not meet criteria for dementia (non-demented), and patients with very mild AD. The two patient groups differed significantly from controls in entorhinal volume, but not from each other; in contrast, they differed from each other, as well as from controls, in hippocampal volume, with the mild AD cases showing the greatest atrophy. Follow-up clinical evaluations available on 23/28 non-demented patients indicated that 12/23 had converted to AD within 12-77 months from the baseline MRI examination. Converters could be best differentiated from non-converters on the basis of entorhinal, but not hippocampal volume.

When compared with the general population, their risk of dementia is five to six times higher. Recent investigations using structural MRI have shown that dementia in PD is related to cortical structural changes and that specific cognitive dysfunctions can be attributed to atrophy in specific structures. We review the structural MRI studies carried out in PD using either a manual region of interest (ROI) approach or voxel-based morphometry (VBM). ROI studies have shown that hippocampal volume is decreased in patients with PD with and without dementia; in addition, hippocampal atrophy correlated with deficits in verbal memory. VBM studies have demonstrated that dementia in PD involves structural changes in limbic areas and widespread cortical atrophy. Findings in nondemented patients with PD are less conclusive, possibly because cognitively heterogeneous groups of patients have been studied. Patients with PD with cognitive impairment and/or visual hallucinations present greater brain atrophy than patients without these characteristics. These findings suggest that cortical atrophy is related to cognitive dysfunction in PD and precedes the development of dementia. Structural MRI might therefore provide an early marker for dementia in PD.","authors":[{"name":"Naroa Ibarretxe-Bilbao"},{"name":"Eduardo Tolosa"},{"name":"Carme Junque"},{"name":"Maria-Jose Marti"}],"cluster":2,"date":"2009/01/01","id":"pd3d518b425c63c44","ring0":[],"ring1":["p8d944f8de99287e1","pcba779ac0ec2c700","p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b","pf37dc76323f6c28a","padc524ddda484d04","pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8","pd95669bdd96047e4"],"ring2":["p0efa1235d81453d8","p03357fdbc3285a1f","p7aadcd192c6b13f2","p5c9433861db6048e","pd9e19bca2600b2b3","pe79b3fc6b2f4c642","p3adb19dfff6f7898","p66b5b5e2afa23902","p48552e3cf5a7d428","p76d4e9088134dc50","pcb9c19017550a5b0","p36921b93f40c4161","p25066a75ce048c92","p25728be31519b600","pf0a92ee32f8d2420","pbf5741583ce566a5","pc02d5774cf74a770","p225cc835ad930b3b"],"ring3":["p4c71bbe7d05a72ef","p0bf3d570e5f3350d","pa9238aa0a5f56f7f","p44489f4856976977","pd28c36a66168d75d","pc00b3c65b5287be0","p0a9650062ef6b287"],"rings":[[],["p8d944f8de99287e1","pcba779ac0ec2c700","p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b","pf37dc76323f6c28a","padc524ddda484d04","pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8","pd95669bdd96047e4"],["p0efa1235d81453d8","p03357fdbc3285a1f","p7aadcd192c6b13f2","p5c9433861db6048e","pd9e19bca2600b2b3","pe79b3fc6b2f4c642","p3adb19dfff6f7898","p66b5b5e2afa23902","p48552e3cf5a7d428","p76d4e9088134dc50","pcb9c19017550a5b0","p36921b93f40c4161","p25066a75ce048c92","p25728be31519b600","pf0a92ee32f8d2420","pbf5741583ce566a5","pc02d5774cf74a770","p225cc835ad930b3b"],["p4c71bbe7d05a72ef","p0bf3d570e5f3350d","pa9238aa0a5f56f7f","p44489f4856976977","pd28c36a66168d75d","pc00b3c65b5287be0","p0a9650062ef6b287"]],"similarity_matrix":{"p03357fdbc3285a1f":0.3254623299168608,"p0a9650062ef6b287":0.1938691030994786,"p0bf3d570e5f3350d":0.14156590236355868,"p0efa1235d81453d8":0.4447935608279688,"p225cc835ad930b3b":0.34362728294202144,"p25066a75ce048c92":0.43514310280622337,"p25728be31519b600":0.3737908383383201,"p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b":0.6070699595013981,"p36921b93f40c4161":0.43009725016915806,"p3adb19dfff6f7898":0.4448500712175627,"p44489f4856976977":0.12633747170415313,"p48552e3cf5a7d428":0.3282302598499042,"p4c71bbe7d05a72ef":0.17313071337581867,"p5c9433861db6048e":0.30253363198712296,"p66b5b5e2afa23902":0.4752002743095691,"p76d4e9088134dc50":0.36567660451575656,"p7aadcd192c6b13f2":0.31377879670250036,"p8d944f8de99287e1":0.5350538293631787,"pa9238aa0a5f56f7f":0.1987556094387962,"padc524ddda484d04":0.6978827442143793,"pbf5741583ce566a5":0.4917304611364408,"pc00b3c65b5287be0":0.058751217863938145,"pc02d5774cf74a770":0.42054107161930215,"pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8":0.6347116852933525,"pcb9c19017550a5b0":0.26446907069809095,"pcba779ac0ec2c700":0.5354295909920347,"pd28c36a66168d75d":0.14573042799081812,"pd95669bdd96047e4":0.6275133991080646,"pd9e19bca2600b2b3":0.33484186750301054,"pe79b3fc6b2f4c642":0.3733816106680603,"pf0a92ee32f8d2420":0.4181181316847917,"pf37dc76323f6c28a":0.5129755949774985},"similarity_ring":{"p03357fdbc3285a1f":2,"p0a9650062ef6b287":3,"p0bf3d570e5f3350d":3,"p0efa1235d81453d8":2,"p225cc835ad930b3b":2,"p25066a75ce048c92":2,"p25728be31519b600":2,"p2727b2bd4fb6ef6b":1,"p36921b93f40c4161":2,"p3adb19dfff6f7898":2,"p44489f4856976977":3,"p48552e3cf5a7d428":2,"p4c71bbe7d05a72ef":3,"p5c9433861db6048e":2,"p66b5b5e2afa23902":2,"p76d4e9088134dc50":2,"p7aadcd192c6b13f2":2,"p8d944f8de99287e1":1,"pa9238aa0a5f56f7f":3,"padc524ddda484d04":1,"pbf5741583ce566a5":2,"pc00b3c65b5287be0":3,"pc02d5774cf74a770":2,"pc2abdb0ee2a8c5e8":1,"pcb9c19017550a5b0":2,"pcba779ac0ec2c700":1,"pd28c36a66168d75d":3,"pd95669bdd96047e4":1,"pd9e19bca2600b2b3":2,"pe79b3fc6b2f4c642":2,"pf0a92ee32f8d2420":2,"pf37dc76323f6c28a":1},"similarity_values":[0.4447935608279688,0.5350538293631787,0.3254623299168608,0.17313071337581867,0.5354295909920347,0.14156590236355868,0.1987556094387962,0.31377879670250036,0.6070699595013981,0.5129755949774985,0.30253363198712296,0.6978827442143793,0.33484186750301054,0.6347116852933525,0.6275133991080646,0.3733816106680603,0.4448500712175627,0.4752002743095691,0.12633747170415313,0.3282302598499042,0.36567660451575656,0.26446907069809095,0.43009725016915806,0.43514310280622337,0.14573042799081812,0.3737908383383201,0.058751217863938145,0.4181181316847917,0.4917304611364408,0.9999999999999983,0.42054107161930215,0.1938691030994786,0.34362728294202144],"title":"MRI and Cognitive Impairment in Parkinson's Disease","value":14},{"abstract":"We studied the usefulness of measuring volumes of the hippocampus, amygdala and frontal lobes with coronal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans in the diagnosis of early Alzheimer's disease (AD). We examined 32 patients diagnosed according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria of probable AD and 16 age-matched healthy cognitively normal controls. The AD patients had mild dementia with a mean score of 22.8 in the Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE). We used a 1.5 T magnetic resonance imager and normalized the volumes for brain area. The AD patients had significantly smaller volumes of the right and the left hippocampus (-38%) (ANOVA, p < 0.0001) and the left frontal lobe (-16%, p < 0.05) compared to controls. The reductions in volumes of the right frontal lobe (-13%), the right amygdala (-14%) or the left amygdala (-18%) were not statistically significant. In the discriminant function analysis which included the volumes of the hippocampus, amygdala, and the frontal lobes and age, the volumes of the left and right hippocampus, the left and right frontal lobe, and the right amygdala entered the model and we could correctly classify 92% of the subjects into AD and control groups (Chi-square 42.6, df 5, p < 0.001). By using the volumes of the hippocampus, the frontal lobes or the amygdala on their alone, the correct classification was achieved in 88%, 65% and 58% of the subjects, respectively. In addition, in AD patients the volumes of the left hippocampus correlated significantly with the MMSE score and with immediate and delayed verbal memory; the smaller the volume the more impaired was their performance.

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET), urine serum, and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) biomarkers, as well as clinical/psychometric assessments are acquired at multiple time points. All data will be cross-linked and made available to the general scientific community. The purpose of this report is to describe the MRI methods employed in ADNI. The ADNI MRI core established specifications that guided protocol development. A major effort was devoted to evaluating 3D T(1)-weighted sequences for morphometric analyses. Several options for this sequence were optimized for the relevant manufacturer platforms and then compared in a reduced-scale clinical trial. The protocol selected for the ADNI study includes: back-to-back 3D magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) scans; B(1)-calibration scans when applicable; and an axial proton density-T(2) dual contrast (i.e., echo) fast spin echo/turbo spin echo (FSE/TSE) for pathology detection. ADNI MRI methods seek to maximize scientific utility while minimizing the burden placed on participants. The approach taken in ADNI to standardization across sites and platforms of the MRI protocol, postacquisition corrections, and phantom-based monitoring of all scanners could be used as a model for other multisite trials.","authors":[{"name":"Clifford R.

Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Parkinson's disease dementia (PDD) is still unclear.\n\nOBJECTIVES:\nHere we investigated whether microglial activation measured by [11C]PK11195 PET is associated with neuronal function measured by cerebral glucose metabolic rate (rCMRGlc) using FDG-PET and hippocampal volume measurements.\n\nMETHODS:\nWe enrolled 25 subjects (9 PDD, 8 AD, and 8 controls) who underwent PET scans with [11C](R)PK11195, [18F]FDG, and volumetric MRI scanning.\n\nRESULTS:\nSPM correlation analysis in AD and PDD showed a negative correlation between hippocampal volume and microglial activation within hippocampus or parahippocampus and with cortical and subcortical areas of projections from hippocampus, while there was a positive correlation between rCMRGlc in cortical and subcortical areas of projections from hippocampus and hippocampal volume. Hippocampal volume was significantly reduced in AD compared to controls but not in PDD.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nThese findings indicate that microglial activation inversely correlated with hippocampal volume and hippocampal rCMRGlc in neurodegenerative diseases with dementia, providing further evidence for the central role of microglial activation in neurodegenerative diseases.","authors":[{"name":"Grazia D.
