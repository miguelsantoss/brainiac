Our meta-analysis included SNPs either genotyped or successfully imputed in at least 40% of the Alzheimer's disease cases and 40% of the control samples across all data sets.

The genomic control inflation factor for the meta-analysis was 1.087 for the full set of SNPs and 1.082 after excluding SNPs within the APOE locus and within 500 kb of SNPs associated with Alzheimer's disease at a prespecified level of genome-wide significance in stage 1.

In stage 2, we selected for genotyping all stage 1 SNPs with a P value less than 1 10−3, excluding SNPs flanking APOE. From the initial set of SNPs, 14,445 could be genotyped using Illumina iSelect technology.

More detailed results for the seven newly ated SNPs within each of these two genes are not in LD; There was no significant heterogeneity across studies at any of the loci, a recombination peak exists between the two loci; and except at DSG2. To identify conditional analysis in the stage 2 data confirmed the indepotential causative genes, we also examined all SNPs with association pendence of the PTK2B association.

The region defined by all the SNPs associated with Alzheimer's disease risk in our data is large and contains about ten genes.

After the exclusion of SNPs showing logistic regression coefficient |β| > 5 or P value equal to 0 or 1, the maximum number of SNPs in any data set was 8,131,643.

During the Illumina production process, 2,287 SNPs failed oligonucleotide synthesis, leading to a final number of 14,445 SNPs for which genotyping was attempted.

Genotyping failure led to the further exclusion of an additional 1,999 SNPs as a result of the SNPs having no intensity signal, not being polymorphic, only being found in a heterozygous state or having mismatched alleles compared to 1000 Genomes Project data.

After SNP quality control, 11,632 SNPs were considered to be of high genotyping quality in at least 1 country and were analyzed in stage 2.

Of note, of the 7,086 SNPs that we were unable to successfully genotype, only 471 were not tagged by another successfully genotyped variant and associated with a P value at least 10 times higher than that of the missing SNP. Because the vast majority of the untagged SNPs exhibited stage 1 P values between 1 10−3 and 1 10−4, the likelihood of missing a true association was considered to be low.
