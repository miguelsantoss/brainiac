ABSTRACT
Objective This was longitudinal single center cohort study comprehensively explore multimodal progression markers for Parkinson disease PD patients with recently diagnosed PD
 and age matched neurologically healthy controls HC 
Methods Thirty tests baseline and after months covered nonmotor symptoms NMS cognitive function and REM sleep behavior disorder RBD polysomnography PSG voxel based
morphometry VBM the brain MRI and CSF markers Linear mixed effect models were used
 estimate differences rates change and provide standardized effect sizes with 
confidence intervals CI 
Results A composite panel informative markers was identified Significant relative worsening PD HC was seen with the following markers the Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale I
 CI the Autonomic Scale for Outcomes Parkinsons Disease CI
 the Epworth Sleepiness Scale CI the RBD Screening Questionnaire CI and RBD PSG CI well VBM units 
cortical gray matter CI and hippocampus CI 
Markers with relative improvement included the Nonmotor Symptom Severity Scale CI
 and depression scales Beck Depression Inventory CI 
Montgomery sberg Depression Rating Scale CI Unexpectedly cognitive measures and select laboratory markers were not significantly changed PD HC participants 
Conclusions Current CSF biomarkers and cognitive scales not represent useful progression
markers However sleep and imaging measures and some extent NMS assessed using adequate scales may more informative markers quantify progression Neurology

meaningful endpoints that measure progression lack thereof To date numerous clinical
trials with putative neuroprotective agents have yielded negative results It remains unclear
whether trial design the agent tested both are the reasons for past failures

Reports selective longitudinal investigations nonmotor signs NMS neuroimaging and laboratory have been
previously published potential markers 
progression These investigations were
largely conducted smaller cohorts and
focused single symptoms measures and frequently relied more advanced PD cases 
and lacked age matched healthy controls 
The novo Parkinson DeNoPa cohort
represents prospective longitudinal singlecenter observational study participants
with novo PD and matched neurologically
healthy controls HC The studys aim 
improve early diagnosis and assess proper
progression markers scored baseline with
biannual follow 
We hypothesized that composite panel 
multimodal progression markers covering
overall NMS cognitive measures sleep imaging and CSF indices would instructive 
understanding the natural history early
PD and thereby delineate specific and sensitive outcome measures for future intervention trials To this end applied the same
panel tests group HC separate
PD changes from the process normal aging 
METHODS Study participants Longitudinal data were collected baseline BL and months follow FU 
Detailed inclusion criteria have been described and
are summarized appendix the Neurology Web site

Standard protocol approvals registrations and patient
consents We received approval from the ethical standards committee human experimentation Landesrztekammer Frankfurt for all experiments using human participants Written
informed consent was obtained from all study participants consent for research 
Procedures Protocols data collection and data sample storage
have been described previously Briefly our approach 
exploratory nature We examined longitudinal assessments using
validated and published tools NMS were the most relevant diagnostic tests and were also investigated longitudinally
 means the Movement Disorder Society MDS UPDRS
part I the NMS Questionnaire the Nonmotor Symptom Scale
 NMSS and the Autonomic Scale for Outcomes Parkinsons
Disease Scopa AUT The PD Questionnaire which has been
the primary endpoint randomized studies was used together
with assessment depression the self reported Beck
Depression Inventory BDI and the Montgomery sberg
Depression Rating Scale MADRS Cognition was tested with
the Mini Mental State Examination MMSE the Montreal
Cognitive Assessment Test MoCA and the Clock Drawing
Test Further tests for different cognitive domains are given 
appendix Sleep was assessed using the Parkinsons Disease
Sleep Scale the Epworth Sleepiness Scale ESS and the REM
Sleep Behavior Disorder RBD Screening Questionnaire RBDSQ In addition performed video supported polysomnography
 PSG classify RBD Voxel based morphometry VBM gray
matter and hippocampus T volumetric MRI was included
because significant atrophy has been described correlation with
PD progression and cognitive decline We also investigated serum
urate We tested known CSF markers that have been previously
discussed potential diagnostic markers PD state its
progression including total synuclein syn amyloid 
total and phosphorylated tau protein tau and tau well 
neurofilament light chain proteins See appendix for
experimental details 
Statistical analysis We used linear mixed effect models 
identify differences the rates change selected markers
between PD and controls For each marker estimated 
random intercept model including group PD HC time BL 
FU and their interaction predictors Models were estimated
using restricted maximum likelihood estimation taking into
account all available data points BL and FU Differential
change PD apparent significant group multiplied the
time interaction We present model based effect sizes for
differential change standardized the observed SD the PD
group baseline Significance testing was based 
confidence intervals using parametric bootstrap with resamples 
In addition explored whether changes individual markers
were influenced selected BL characteristics To this end conducted robust multiple regression analyses the PD sample predicting FU scores individual markers while controlling for
respective BL scores from LED and dopamine agonists FU
and selected sociodemographic and clinical factors BL Robust
regression was used deal with non normality outliers 
the distribution markers All analyses were carried out with
the statistical platform R using the package for linear mixed
models and robustbase for robust regressions 
We did not correct for multiple testing since our approach
was exploratory nature see also the Discussion and appendix However marker candidates were chosen according 
their clinical relevance and following review the literature

DISCUSSION We performed year follow 
investigation clinical measures and biomarkers
through clinical and technical assessment including
PSG MRI and serum CSF measures the largest
single center cohort clinically diagnosed
early PD participants and matched healthy
controls Overall found that tests
showed statistically significant and specific
progression our DeNoPa patients The remaining
 markers showed statistically significant changes
reflecting either progression PD change due 
treatment both when compared controls these
encompassed increasing sleep disturbances and
worsening NMS whereas NMS severity NMSS 
and depression MADRS and BDI improved

Following analysis various domains cognition

differences but only cross sectionally and not with
any significant change longitudinally Most previous
longitudinal studies did not include control groups 
Therefore previous studies PD may have overinterpreted normal cognitive aging and have thus corrected this deficit our study design

for this discrepancy It could also explained the

who consented serial lumbar puncture 
FU A similarly small annual rate change CSF
markers has also been observed patients with established Alzheimer disease AD The stability our
markers this early stage motor PD could result
from slowing the neurodegeneration process 
the symptomatic phase similar that seen AD 
This underlines the need for more specific progression
marker candidates for the early phase the disease 
which will emerge from this and other ongoing studies 
We explored many obvious candidates large
cohort PD participants and looked for progression
markers for future use clinical trial cohorts and
tried exclude noninformative ones The fact that
 identified more than the markers analyzed having significantly changed during our month observational period highlights the mandate
 finding reliable progression markers These results
have immediate consequences for clinical research 
PD restricting the potential usage some
markers and will take more time eventually change
the clinical care delivered patients with PD 
There are limitations clinical practiceled
exploratory studies such ours which merit discussion First DeNoPa real life observational survey
study Therefore symptomatically treated patients motor symptoms The effects dopaminergic
treatment NMS vary depending the underlying mechanisms symptom influenced 
dopaminergic deficit may respond positively dopaminergic treatment such depression and NMS 
whereas non dopamine responsive symptom may
worsen with such treatment such daytime sleepiness especially the early titration phase further
discussion can found appendix Therefore cannot remove any influence conferred 
therapy our investigational markers but purposefully included markers that are likely independent
 any introduced symptomatic therapy such 
MRI volumetry and blood and CSF markers 
Second most our proposed marker candidates
showed promising results early diagnostic markers 
which does not necessarily qualify them progression markers Further marker candidates specific for
progression the disease need explored Third 
 did not control for multiple testing Although this
 appropriate exploratory strategy for detecting
true changes patients with PD reducing type
II errors may lead false positive findings However the detection significant changes among
 tested clearly more than would expected 
chance alone thus corroborating the significance 
our results whole 
The use our proposed panel outcome measures needs further validation before being used rate
progression across centers One limitation the
responsiveness depression and some NMS therapy requiring new elaborated NMS scales This
should undertaken independently multicenter
cohorts enrolling larger numbers participants this
 currently underway 
Future studies need investigate the validity
