Objective Diffusion tensor imaging DTI for the assessment fractional anisotropy FA and involving measurements mean diffusivity MD and apparent diffusion coefficient ADC represents novel MRI based noninvasive
technique that may delineate microstructural changes cerebral white matter WM For example DTI may used
for the diagnosis and differentiation idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus iNPH from other neurodegenerative
diseases with similar imaging findings and clinical symptoms and signs The goal the current study was identify and
analyze recently published series the use DTI diagnostic tool Moreover the authors also explored the utility 
DTI identifying patients with iNPH who could managed surgical intervention 
Methods The authors performed literature search the PubMed database using any possible combinations 
the following terms Alzheimers disease brain cerebrospinal fluid CSF diffusion tensor imaging DTI hydrocephalus idiopathic magnetic resonance imaging normal pressure Parkinsons disease and shunting Moreover all reference lists from the retrieved articles were reviewed identify any additional pertinent articles 
Results The literature search retrieved studies which DTI was used for the identification and differentiation 
iNPH from other neurodegenerative diseases The DTI protocols involved different approaches such region interest ROI methods tract based spatial statistics voxel based analysis and delta ADC analysis The most studied anatomical regions were the periventricular WM areas such the internal capsule IC the corticospinal tract CST and
the corpus callosum CC Patients with iNPH had significantly higher MD the periventricular WM areas the CST
and the CC than had healthy controls In addition FA and ADCs were significantly higher the CST iNPH patients
than any other patients with other neurodegenerative diseases Gait abnormalities iNPH patients were statistically
significantly and negatively correlated with FA the CST and the minor forceps Fractional anisotropy had sensitivity
 and specificity for diagnosing iNPH Furthermore FA and MD values the CST the IC the anterior
thalamic region the fornix and the hippocampus regions could help differentiate iNPH from Alzheimer Parkinson disease Interestingly CSF drainage ventriculoperitoneal shunting significantly modified FA and ADCs iNPH patients
whose condition clinically responded these maneuvers 
Conclusions Measurements FA and MD significantly contribute the detection axonal loss and gliosis the
periventricular WM areas patients with iNPH Diffusion tensor imaging may also represent valuable noninvasive
method for differentiating iNPH from other neurodegenerative diseases Moreover DTI can detect dynamic changes 
the WM tracts after lumbar drainage shunting procedures and could help identify iNPH patients who may benefit from
surgical intervention

ormal pressure hydrocephalus NPH first described Salomon Hakim defined 
 clinicopathological condition related the overproduction flow obstruction CSF The prevalence
 this disease age related reaching among
elderly individuals It remains one the most controversial neuropathological entities both regards 
its diagnosis and its proper management Characteristically despite many recent advances imaging methods 
most NPH cases still remain idiopathic Normal pressure
hydrocephalus usually characterized idiopathic although can secondarily present several disorders
and conditions such subarachnoid hemorrhage head
trauma and CNS tumors Patients with idiopathic NPH
 iNPH have enlarged ventricles but normal CSF pressure
seen diagnostic lumbar puncture The most common
symptoms iNPH are summarized clinical triad gait
disturbance dementia and urinary incontinence However these symptoms are not pathognomonic and may
also present vascular dementia Alzheimer disease
 AD and Parkinson disease PD among many other less
common diseases The exact underlying pathophysiological mechanism this disorder has remained ill defined 
and several theories supporting the combination CSF
circulation disturbances along with other cerebrovascular
disorders have been proposed 
The diagnosis NPH based patients clinical
status imaging findings and the natural history the disease The imaging criteria for NPH are mainly ventricular
enlargement with Evans index lack any
anatomical obstruction the CSF circulation enlarged
temporal horns and corpus callosum CC angle 
greater than brain CT MRI scans Other diagnostic methods are radionuclide cisternogram showing delayed clearance hours the infused
radiotracer over the cerebral convexities brain cine
MRI study revealing increased ventricular flow rate and
 SPECT scan indicating decreased periventricular perfusion 
Recently several clinical investigators have employed
diffusion tensor imaging DTI techniques detect and
quantify any WM alterations patients with iNPH The
DTI data generally indicate the movements water molecules inside the brain tissue The combination D
diffusionweighted images with all diagonal elements 
 D diffusion model creates high resolution MRI series which may identify even subtle structural changes
 the periventricular white matter WM Quantitative
measurements these changes are enabled fractional
anisotropy FA and apparent diffusion coefficient ADC 
methods which can used determine the structural
integrity the brain tissue Researchers have used basic models analyze DTI data region interest ROI 
analysis tract specific analysis and voxel wise statistical
analysis The ROI analysis has the disadvantage subjectivity The tract specific analysis applied only regions the brain which diffusion can accurately
measured Voxel wise analysis more useful measuring WM changes since can performed the whole
brain The iNPH associated axonal loss could explain the
observed decreased FA the anterior frontal WM find

statistically significantly increased MD the periventricular corticospinal tract CST and the CC Fractional
anisotropy was also significantly increased the CST
among the iNPH patients although such increase was not
observed the CC these patients The authors reported
that the observed gait abnormalities among the patients
with iNPH were statistically significantly correlated with
the DTI results the CST they noted strong positive
correlation between MD and the number 
steps and walking duration In addition FA the CST
was weakly and negatively correlated with both
 these gait variables 
In addition Hattori used TBSS ROI and tractspecific analysis methods assess FA the CST 
patients with iNPH and age matched healthy controls Fractional anisotropy the CST showed patterns specific iNPH White matter abnormalities vary
 iNPH patients observation that was also confirmed
 significantly decreased FA the WM located the
frontal and the parietal lobes and significantly increased FA the IC 
Similarly Koyama used DTI metrics iNPH
patients and healthy controls generate FA brain maps
and determine TBSS measure FA selected ROIs the
CC posterior limb the internal capsule IC and cerebral peduncles Compared with the controls patients
with iNPH had significantly lower FA the CC and significantly higher FA the posterior limb the IC The
authors also reported that gait abnormalities the iNPH
patients were statistically significantly correlated with the
lower FA the CC 
In another study Koyama studying patients
with iNPH and age matched controls used computer automated method generate FA brain maps adjusted the standard stereotactic space The authors
focused ROIs the minor forceps and the CST In
both these regions FA was decreased among the patients with iNPH but this decrease did not reach statistical significance Moreover the authors postulated that the
FA the minor forceps was negatively correlated with
the clinical manifestations iNPH such urinary incontinence and gait disturbances Similarly study
 iNPH patients and healthy controls Nakanishi 
 used tract specific analysis mean diffusional kurtosis
imaging DKI and DTI the CST the level the
lateral ventricle and observed that DKI and axial diffusion kurtosis values were significantly lower the iNPH
patients than the controls In contrast ADCs FA and
axial eigenvalues were significantly higher the
patients with iNPH 
Recently Osawa and colleagues studying iNPH
patients and healthy controls used new metric the
delta ADC which determines the changes ADCs the
brain during one cardiac cycle Delta ADCs the frontal temporal and occipital lobes were significantly higher
 the iNPH patients than the control patients Although
ADCs were also significantly higher the iNPH group
than the control group these differences were smaller
than those observed the delta ADCs The authors also
reported that ADCs and delta ADCs were not significantly correlated with each other

DTI Characteristics iNPH and Other Neurodegenerative
Diseases With Similar Signs and Symptoms
Daouk studied DTI patterns WM the region the IC ventricular morphometry and CSF flow
 patients with iNPH AD The authors reported that
FA was statistically significantly correlated with the ventricular dimensions the patients with iNPH 
Spearmans rho In the patients with AD CSF
aqueductal flow was statistically significantly correlated
with the ADC Spearmans rho Although the authors noted abnormalities the CSF flow 
both patient groups patients with iNPH appeared have
different DTI patterns the region the IC which could
 significant imaging finding that could differentiate
these pathological entities 
Hattori and colleagues investigated the differences 
DTI findings among patients with iNPH patients
with AD patients with PD and dementia and 
healthy controls The authors used DTI the CST 
measure FA and axial and radial eigenvalues with tractspecific analysis Only FA and axial eigenvalues were
significantly higher the iNPH group than the other
 groups The CST tractography patients
with iNPH revealed qualitative pattern that was different from the patterns the other patient groups and this
difference was statistically significant The authors reported that the analysis FA the CST had 
sensitivity and specificity detecting iNPH 
In further study Hattori using tract specific
analysis performed DTI the fornix patients with
iNPH patients with AD and healthy controls In
addition the authors recorded the volume length and
mean cross sectional area the fornix the study participants The iNPH and AD groups had significantly
smaller volume the fornix and had significantly lower
FA and smaller cross sectional areas this region than
the healthy controls Interestingly the fornix was significantly longer iNPH patients than the AD patients and
healthy controls 
Hong performed DTI the main regions the
hippocampus the head body and tail iNPH
patients AD patients and healthy controls The
authors measured DTI variables both hemispheres and
used the ROI selection technique They reported that the
tissue volume the hippocampus did not significantly differ between the iNPH and AD groups Fractional anisotropy was lowest the AD patients whereas MD was the
highest these patients For the patients with iNPH the
FA and MD values were between the groups Healthy
controls had the highest FA and the lowest MD the 
groups investigated The authors also noted that ROI 
laterality the hippocampus has insignificant influence
 FA and MD results 
Ivkovic and coworkers employed new DTI technique
based T MRI sequences patients with possible
iNPH patients with various disorders including AD 
PD Lewy body dementia and patients with both NPH
and AD The authors used MD histograms discriminate the brain and the ventricles from theoretical third

tion DTI and diffusion weighted imaging techniques 
The authors novel technique efficiently recognized and
distinguished the pathological conditions with sensitivity and specificity respectively However the
specificity this new method dropped when 
was used discriminate patients with iNPH from those
with AD 
Kanno used the DTI technique determine MD
and FA from voxel based statistical map distinguish
iNPH patients from AD patients and PD 
patients In the supratentorial WM areas the highest
MD and the lowest FA were observed the patients with
iNPH The periventricular areas exhibited high MD while
the CC and subcortical areas had low FA the patients
with iNPH In addition only the mean hemispherical FA
values were partially associated with the clinical severity iNPH The authors also reported that the FA results
obtained from the anterior limb the IC and from the
region under the left supplementary motor area were associated with more severed gait abnormalities the patients
with iNPH Using the frontal assessment battery method 
 evaluation tool that evaluates the functionality the
frontal lobes and reveals cognitive impairment patients
with dementia Kanno and coworkers also observed that
FA the frontal and the parietal subcortical WM was
statistically significantly correlated with frontal lobe functionality iNPH patients 
Marumoto and others investigated FA different
brain regions iNPH patients PD patients and 
healthy controls According this study FA the anterior thalamic radiation and the minor forceps was lower 
iNPH patients than the PD patients Moreover FA the
anterior thalamic radiation was statistically significantly
associated with gait disturbances both patient groups 
DTI Characteristics iNPH Patients Undergoing CSF
Drainage Shunt Placement
Demura determined FA and ADCs several
WM regions patients with possible iNPH before and
 hours after CSF tap test The patients were separated
into groups those who had significant neurological improvement after the CSF tap test patients and those
who had improvement patients A statistically significant decrease ADCs was detected only for
the patients with neurological improvement In contrast 
significant increase FA after the CSF tap test
was observed both groups 
Jurcoane studied groups patients with iNPH
after they had undergone CSF drainage via spinal tap 
the first group comprised patients whose gait significantly improved days after the CSF drainage and the
second group consisted patients whose gait did not
improve The authors performed DTI and magnetization transfer ratio MTR measurements the CSTs after
the CSF drainage both patient groups In addition the
DTI and MTR assessments were repeated the patients
 the first group after undergoing ventriculoperitoneal
shunt placement As reference the authors used the DTI
and MTR results the superior longitudinal fasciculus
before and after CSF removal the iNPH groups and
also from age matched healthy controls The study
participants the control group had statistically significantly lower axial diffusivity than the patients
 the iNPH groups In addition the patients whose gait
had improved after CSF drainage had higher FA than the
healthy controls and both axial diffusivity and FA statistically significantly decreased after the shunt placement
 these patients The authors concluded that reduction
 axial diffusivity greater than could accurately
discriminate with sensitivity between those iNPH
patients who respond CSF drainage and those who 
not The authors also postulated that when the axial diffusivity decrease reaches could accurately predict
with sensitivity and specificity which iNPH
patients would show overall clinical improvement after
shunt placement They also concluded that using only DTI
measurements before CSF drainage their study could
not differentiate those responding the drainage from
those who not 
Lenfeldt performed DTI iNPH patients before and days after removal milliliters CSF via 
spinal tap and also healthy controls The authors
reported that FA the anterior frontal WM was significantly lower the iNPH patients than the controls In
addition the ADCs the genu the CC and the centrum
semiovale were elevated the iNPH patients compared
with the ADCs the healthy controls The authors also
noted that all iNPH patients the ADCs did not change
after the CSF drainage 
In study patients with clinical and imaging
manifestations iNPH and healthy controls ReissZimmermann studied DTI changes the patients
with iNPH after CSF drainage Of note only the
patients were eventually included the authors study
protocol All DTI measurements FA and mean parallel and radial diffusivities were performed before and
after within hours lumbar drainage The results 
this study indicated that FA was higher the subcortical
WM and the CC patients with iNPH than the controls In addition the increased radial diffusivity tended 
normalize after the CSF drainage 
Kim employed DTI patients with iNPH
before surgery and also patients with AD patients with subcortical vascular dementia and healthy
controls The imaging protocol was repeated iNPH
patients who had undergone CSF shunt placement The
authors reported that the presurgical iNPH group had the
highest FA all groups the posterior limb the IC 
They also observed that FA significantly decreased after
the shunt placement Before the shunting the iNPH patients had MD values the anterior periventricular WM 
the anterior limb the IC and the superior longitudinal
fasciculus that were higher than the patients with AD
and the healthy controls but were lower than the
patients with subcortical vascular dementia The authors
also reported that FA could diagnose iNPH with 
sensitivity and specificity 
Using new direction sequence acquisition with 
T MRI unit Nicot investigated alterations FA
and also the ADC the IC and the body the CC 
 iNPH patients after the patients had undergone shunt
placement The authors measurements obtained with

conventional DTI protocol showed that only the ADCs 
the IC were significantly higher postoperatively In contrast the novel image acquisition technique indicated 
significant postoperative decrease FA 
Discussion
Several hypotheses have been proposed for explaining
the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms iNPH 
Most these theories converge the concept that ventricular enlargement stretches and compresses the periventricular WM and the adjacent CC leading interstitial
edema and progressive axonal loss Neuropathological findings NPH are consistent with demyelination the frontal lobes presence microinfarctions 
organized thrombi lacunas arteriole sclerosis the
periventricular WM and leptomeningeal fibrosis Compression deformation the CST due the ventricular
enlargement results frontal lobe dysfunction malfunction the corticobasal ganglia thalamic circuit both 
This malfunction greatly affects the supplementary motor
cortex resulting the gait disturbances characteristic 
patients with NPH Numerous similarities pathogenesis between iNPH and AD other subcortical vascular dementias have been reported Symptoms 
iNPH resemble those observed disorders arising from
diseases the frontal lobe Biopsy samples taken 
the time shunt placement patients with iNPH have
shown the presence AD type histological changes 
which may explain the lack treatment responses after
shunt placements these cases 
Several researchers have underlined the significance
 DTI based methods for diagnosing iNPH A
plethora different DTI protocols for examining various
areas the brain have been described the literature 
including manual ROI placement TBSS tract specific 
voxel based and delta ADC analyses The most frequently studied regions patients with iNPH are the periventricular WM areas such the IC CST and CC well 
the frontal temporal and occipital lobes and the cerebral
peduncles Patients with iNPH have significantly higher
MD the CST and the CC than healthy controls In
addition most studies have reported significantly higher
FA the CST among iNPH patients than among healthy
subjects The only exception was the study Koyama
 which reported decreased FA values the CST and
the minor forceps iNPH patients Significantly less
experience exists with the use DKI for evaluating 
diagnosing iNPH It has been reported however that DKI
values the CST are significantly decreased iNPH
patients compared with those healthy controls The
delta ADC has also been used for examining patients with
suspected iNPH and has been reported that delta ADCs
 the frontal temporal and occipital lobes are increased
 iNPH patients relative the corresponding delta ADCs
 healthy controls Furthermore several clinical investigators have reported that the gait abnormalities iNPH
patients are statistically significantly correlated with increased FA the CST and the minor forceps

areas such the CST and the CC may help improve the
diagnosis NPH Additionally FA and MD both seem
 correlate well with NPH symptoms particularly with
gait disturbance Thus the DTI method may useful
noninvasive diagnostic tool that not only can help diagnose NPH but may also assist the grading the clinical
severity and progression NPH We note that the number
 published series DTI for NPH diagnosis still small
and that these studies had relatively low numbers participants In addition some normal age related changes
 brain function and structure these participants may
have also influenced the accuracy this imaging method 
Despite these limiting factors the available data support
the inclusion DTI preoperative imaging assessments
during the examination patients with suspected NPH 
In addition FA and MD may well important for differentiating iNPH from other neurodegenerative diseases
such AD and PD that frequently have overlapping clinical symptoms and signs It has been shown that
iNPH and AD patients have different DTI findings the
IC Moreover also has been reported that the ventricular volume positively correlated with FA patients with
iNPH Characteristically FA various periventricular
areas patients with iNPH statistically significantly differs from that patients with PD AD For example 
FA and axial eigenvalues the CST were reported 
significantly higher patients with iNPH than PD 
AD patients Of note FA has sensitivity and 
specificity for diagnosing iNPH In addition FA
 the fornix significantly lower patients with iNPH
than those with AD Patients with iNPH have higher
FA the hippocampus than AD patients but lower FA
 the same region than healthy controls Moreover MD
 the hippocampus iNPH patients was reported 
significantly lower than AD patients but significantly
higher than healthy controls Similarly FA values 
the posterior limb the IC and MD the anterior limb
 the IC and the superior longitudinal fasciculus are
significantly higher patients with iNPH than patients
with AD Also iNPH patients have lower FA the anterior thalamic radiation and the minor forceps than PD
patients The use the MD histogram method appears
 have had significant role differentiating iNPH from
AD PD Lewy body dementia This MD method has
been reported have sensitivity and specificity
 differentiating iNPH from the other neurodegenerative
diseases studied 
Differentiating iNPH from other neurodegenerative
diseases represents frequent and complex diagnostic
problem which can addressed with the use DTI
metrics Although previously published morphometric
changes the fornix and the hippocampus appear 
contradictory their evaluation along with DTI findings
may help clinicians differentiate iNPH from other neurodegenerative diseases Newer techniques for analyzing
MD and FA data may provide noninvasive tools for differential diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity 
Again the limiting factors small numbers series
and study sizes decrease the statistical significance the
impact these new imaging based methods improved
iNPH diagnosis 
Diffusion tensor imaging iNPH patients
Moreover the utility DTI with FA and ADC techniques has been studied also patients with iNPH before
and after CSF drainage via spinal tap identify imaging characteristics that could used predict which patients would most likely benefit from the drainage 
Some these studies have reported that CSF drainage
significantly increases FA the periventricular WM and
the CC and also significantly decreases ADC these areas The authors observed that elevated radial diffusivity the subcortical WM returned normal after CSF
drainage iNPH patients with clinical improvement 
These findings may have predictive value selecting
those patients whose NPH might respond CSF shunt
placement However study reported that the DTI variables did not change after CSF drainage 
In addition previous series have investigated the utility
 DTI also patients undergoing CSF shunt procedures 
and all have noted that FA values the CST and the IC decrease after shunt placement Moreover shunt placement increases ADC It has also been proposed that the
significant decrease axial diffusivity after shunting may
have predictive value for selecting patient with iNPH for
surgery In light these findings emphasize the importance adding DTI noninvasive diagnostic tool 
our armamentarium identify iNPH patients who would
respond CSF shunt placement 
Conclusions
Although DTI relatively new imaging modality 
may take significant role the diagnosis and differentiation iNPH from other disorders and diseases with
similar imaging and clinical features The reported specificities and sensitivities this noninvasive imaging method for detecting iNPH are high Moreover the use DTI
could significantly contribute the selection iNPH patients for surgery potentially improving overall outcomes
for these patients and mitigating surgical failure rates 
However wish highlight significant drawbacks
 the wide clinical application the DTI method First 
the existence various technical protocols along with the
significant variation the anatomical areas studied greatly decreases the reproducibility and diagnostic accuracy
 both FA and MD The use these different techniques
and metrics makes meaningful comparison previously
published results practically impossible Second the normal range the parameters measured needs defined
and most probably needs standardized for different
age groups This will require large scale multicenter studies and the adoption widely accepted imaging protocol for creating database and for setting normal measurement ranges Despite these technical limitations and
weaknesses DTI lends itself the examination iNPH
patients and may well improve overall outcomes for these
patients
