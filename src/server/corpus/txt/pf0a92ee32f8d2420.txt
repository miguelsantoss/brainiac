Abstract
Hippocampal atrophy rates are useful both diagnosing and tracking Alzheimers disease AD However cohorts and methods used 
determine such rates are heterogeneous leading differences reported annualised rates We performed meta analysis hippocampal
atrophy rates AD patients and matched controls from studies reported the peer reviewed literature Studies reporting longitudinal volume
change hippocampi AD subjects together with controls were systematically identified and appraised All authors were contacted either
 confirm the results provide missing data Meta analysis and meta regression were then performed this data Nine studies were
included from seven centres with data from total AD and matched controls Mean CIs annualised hippocampal atrophy
rates were found CI for AD subjects and for controls The difference between AD and control
subject this rate was

Introduction
Alzheimers disease AD large and growing problem

over years Dawbarn and Allen and its prevalence
doubles every years above that age Small 
A definitive diagnosis AD can only given following
pathologic examination the brain usually post mortem 
The disease pathologically characterised the presence

nal cortex and hippocampus encompass the whole cortex 
whereas plaque pathology largely cortical and increases

can seen even single time point brain structures 
Alzheimers subjects are smaller average compared with
controls In addition loss tissue volume over time can also
 detected large regions such the whole brain Jack
 and smaller temporal areas such the hippocampus Jack and entorhinal cortex Du 
 This has led number studies that have suggested that hippocampal atrophy rates may useful both
diagnostically and track disease progression

 Jack Barnes In addition different
populations patients have also been included To the best
 our knowledge statistical review the hippocampal
atrophy rate literature has been conducted date Such 
review required assess heterogeneity reported studies better understand how age and disease severity affect
the calculated atrophy rates and pool the results from
these studies more accurately estimate the rate atrophy the hippocampus AD and matched control groups 
This type analysis may also useful identifying outlier results where the methodology employed may deserve
critical review In addition measuring the inter site variance
 hippocampal atrophy rates may useful for anyone planning multi site trial may define the level consistency

 Study objective
The objective this study perform meta analysis 
hippocampal atrophy rates patients with AD and matched
controls from studies reported the peer reviewed literature 
Methods
The following protocol was employed the study 
 General study inclusion criteria
We aimed identify all observational and randomised
controlled trials RCT where hippocampal volume was measured MRI two more points time and annualised
hippocampal atrophy rate was reported for patients with
AD We included data from both arms randomised controlled trials symptomatic treatment was given and only
the placebo arm disease modifying treatment was given
 atrophy rate might have been altered the treatment 
Disease modifying treatments were classified those that
had been shown significantly alter whole brain atrophy
rates 
We included MRI studies reporting results from patients
with AD any age gender There were restrictions 
the method used diagnose AD As MCI was not subject
group being formally assessed part this meta analysis 
cognitively impaired subject groups with mean MMSE
 were excluded No restriction was placed scanning
protocol strength magnet used image the patients 
segmentation protocol used determine the atrophy rate 
Unpublished studies were not included unless accepted
papers had been published ahead print online and studies where the mean annualised rates atrophy could not
 provided the author were excluded Since people with
Downs syndrome Alzheimers disease and mutation carriers the known AD causing genes may have different
course disease studies based their populations were
also excluded

 Statistical analysis
STATA Version Stata Corporation College Station TX 
USA and SAS proc mixed Version SAS Institute Inc 
Cary NC USA were used for the statistical analysis From
each study the mean atrophy rate and standard deviation were
obtained for the AD patients and separately for controls
where available together with means and standard deviations the ages MMSEs and inter scan intervals each
subject group Calculation the standard error required for
meta analysis was based the standard deviation and the
number patients for each study 
 Data synthesis meta analysis 
A random effects meta analysis model was fitted using
restricted maximum likelihood REML consistent with the
assumption that mean atrophy rates measured individual studies vary around overall average atrophy rate The
random effect for between study heterogeneity was assumed
 normally distributed were the within study errors 
In addition tested the hypothesis that the random effects
were needed comparing the REML log likelihood ratio
statistic its asymptotic distribution under the null hypothesis that the random effect variance which given 
mixture two chi squared distributions Morrell 
Since some studies reported results separately for different subgroups AD patients attempted fit 
random effects model that allowed for both between and
within study variation Unfortunately this was not possible 
due the limited number studies that reported results separately subgroup In view this the non independence 
results from subgroups the same study was accounted for
through sharing the study specific random effect For studies containing both control and AD group the mean
difference atrophy rates between the two groups was calculated These differences were then entered further
random effects meta analysis estimate the overall mean
within study difference rates between AD and control
groups 
 Assessment reporting bias
Due the focus this meta analysis unlikely that
studies would denied publication the basis the
estimated size mean atrophy AD patients However 
publication bias was examined with funnel plots Funnel plots
graphically demonstrate publication bias the precision 
the studies increases there should decrease the variability results leading funnel shape Lack symmetry
implies evidence publication bias 
 Subgroup analysis and investigation 
heterogeneity
Heterogeneity atrophy rates between studies may 
explained the mean age disease severity MMSE score 
 study participants inter scan interval This was explored
using the data AD groups through use meta regression
 Sharp This meta regression analysis can only reveal
associations between mean age MMSE scan interval
and mean atrophy rates rather than revealing associations
between individual ages MMSEs scan intervals and individual atrophy rates We added age MMSE and scan interval
separately linear fixed effect our random effects model
 estimate any such associations It was recognised that estimates such effects may imprecise only small number
 studies are available and between study variability 
such factors small 
 Sample size calculation
Of the studies included the meta analysis those with
mean scan intervals year months were used calculated sample sizes In these studies there was little variation
 scan interval between patients We performed randomeffects meta analysis the variance scale these studies
estimated atrophy rate standard deviations give pooled
estimate the standard deviation We assumed that drug
would decrease the atrophy the hippocampus certain
percentage Standard techniques were used estimate sample
sizes that give statistical power detect and 
reduction hippocampal atrophy rates using two sided significance test the level

rate these groups from random effects meta analysis was

ratio test for the need for the between study random effect
was highly statistically significant confirming
that there was strong evidence between study heterogeneity Fig Forest plot the matched control
groups The estimated overall mean atrophy rate
 these groups from random effects meta analysis was
 per year CI The estimate 
between study standard deviation was The likelihood
ratio test for the presence between study heterogeneity was highly statistically significant Fig

AD subgroups within studies using random effects meta 
analysis the estimated mean difference atrophy rates
between controls and AD subjects was per year

Discussion
This study aimed estimate the mean rate hippocampal atrophy across number published studies In addition 
this study aimed formally assess some aspects the heterogeneity these studies Meta analysis plays important
role summarising results from studies owing betweenstudy heterogeneity Effects confounders such disease
severity age may lessened pooling results from all
studies making the results more applicable the wider population 
Hippocampal rates atrophy were consistently greater 
AD subjects than controls all studies included this metaanalysis The pooled mean rates atrophy were 
the control subjects and AD subjects respectively 
The AD control differences were significantly different the
 studies where both controls and AD subjects had been
assessed and reported The two studies where the differences
were not statistically significant had the largest confidence
intervals Thompson Kaye Overall 
the pooled mean difference between AD and control groups
was and was significantly greater than Fig 
There was large amount between study variability both
AD rates and control rates The between study variability 
AD control rate differences was also relatively large which
cannot attributed factors that affect both controls and
ADs study such scanning protocol Our results therefore suggest that there genuine variation between studies
 AD control rate difference possibly result differences disease severity between studies It has been shown
that rates atrophy can change the disease progresses
 Kaye Ridha Other factors such
 concurrent vascular disease may also affect atrophy rates 
Some studies had higher variances that others this may 
due the methods employed these studies may
 chance owing the relatively small numbers within the
subject groups 
Some aspects the heterogeneity studies are difficult
 formally assess because certain variables were not reported
 see Table These variables include patient related information such other administered medications and APOE
genetic status Treatments may particularly difficult for
casecontrol population based studies report accurately 
since many these studies will conducted tertiary
referral centre whereas may the general physician 
the primary level who prescribes and monitors the administration medication Another example the differences
 reporting studies reliability segmentation technique Most studies did report reliability however the results
are largely incomparable most cases since the measures
were performed different numbers subjects and with
different numbers repetitions and some cases with
same scanning acquisitions and others with different scanning acquisitions 
Other scan parameters and hippocampal delineation methods may also affect the measured atrophy rates such scan
slice thickness segmentation protocol Differences 
anatomical structures included the delineation hippocampi may not have substantial effects the atrophy
rate determined the same protocol used for both baseline and follow scans Data from centres using different
delineation protocols would only agree rates atrophy
were similar separate anatomical locations within the hippocampus for example rate atrophy the hippocampal
tail similar the hippocampal head Meta analysis 
the AD control differences should robust these potential confounders since the hippocampal rates determined 
both subject groups should have been determined the same
way 
Formal meta regression analyses showed significant
associations between mean atrophy rates quoted the studies
included the meta analysis and age MMSE and interval However may that these relationships exist 
meta regression can detect such associations only there
 sufficient variability the explanatory variable between
studies There was little variability mean age between
studies relative within studies perhaps explaining the lack
 association with age A number studies not included

pal atrophy rates healthy controls Scahill 
There was some variability mean MMSE score between
studies however this was not sufficient show any potential association between this variable and rates atrophy 
Most AD subjects included the studies were mild moderately affected perhaps because the need comply with
imaging result the AD groups included had 
mean MMSE between and one group had MMSE
 this lack variability mean MMSE reduced the
chance finding association There was evidence 
 association between mean interval and mean atrophy rate 
despite relatively large variation mean interval between
scans and between studies 
Sample sizes were estimated using data from subjects
which estimate based greater number subjects
than previously reported Compared with other brain regions
reported for similar interval greater number subjects
were required for hippocampal atrophy rates than required
for whole brain ventricular atrophy rates approximately
 subjects required per treatment arm for either brain atrophy ventricular enlargement for reduction atrophy
rates Schott However may that
disease specific effects require investigation and therefore
hippocampal atrophy rates temporal horn enlargement
may interest clinical trials The subjects estimated
for reduction atrophy rates were similar but
lower than the numbers required for temporal horn enlargement number required per treatment arm Jack
This study has number limitations Although this
meta analysis attempted include many studies possible and there was evidence publication bias only nine
studies analysed owing number reasons see Table 
Larger numbers studies would allow more precise estimate the mean rates calculated and for associated
meta regression analyses more robust Collating the
individual patient data from these studies would enable much
more precise estimation relationships between factors such
 age and disease severity with hippocampal atrophy rates 
Associations using individual patient data within studies
would not confounded study level factors such scan
acquisition protocols and methods determine hippocampal atrophy rate Also variability both within and between
studies could used estimate these associations more precisely In addition standard meta analysis techniques assume
that the precision individual study estimates are known
 assumed the estimated value When some contributing studies are small our meta analysis this assumption
may not reasonable Consequently our reported confidence intervals may too narrow 
Because some specific study variables were not reported
consistently see Table and this was impediment 
meta analysis suggest that new studies explicitly report
