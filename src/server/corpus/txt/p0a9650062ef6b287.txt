divided into cores with each core managing ADNI related activities within its sphere expertise clinical 
informatics biostatistics biomarkers and imaging 
The purpose this report describe the MRI methods and decision making process underlying the selection the MRI protocol employed the ADNI study 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The MRI portion the ADNI study was divided into
three phases development preparation and execution
 the study itself In this report outline activities 
the rst two phases Members the MRI core established basic set requirements that guided the protocol development process The overarching principle
was maximize scientic value while minimizing patient burden Specic guidelines were 
The MRI data acquired ADNI must consistent across sites and over time That similar
image qualities contrast noise spatial resolution resistance artifact reliability speed etc 
must achieved across sites and platforms over
time each eld strength 
Based responses initial questionnaire 
virtually all participating clinical enrollment sites
had access least one MRI scanner from GE
Healthcare Philips Medical Systems Siemens
Medical Solutions Consequently scanners from
only these three vendors were supported A variety but not all the MRI platforms from each
vendor were supported Specically some older
platforms Siemens Vision GE Healthcare
systems running software earlier than were
not supported 
Modication existing product pulse sequence particular vendor platform was encouraged but only was both practical and
would substantially benet the study 
The study emphasis was brain morphometry 
hence the most important image set was the weighted D volumetric acquisition Isotropic
voxels were desired avoid directional bias 
but not required The target voxel size was approximately with maximum 
 any one direction 
The whole brain must covered without image
wrap Given the large number and variety participating sites the imaging volume must easy
for technologists prescribe regardless experience level 
The Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
Acquisition time for any series should less
than minutes 
Artifact reduction more important than reduction acquisition time 
At T the increased signal noise ratio SNR 
compared with T was used increase spatial
resolution while increasing the receiver bandwidth help compensate for the increased
chemical shift and the more rapid susceptibility
variation measured hertz T 
The D weighted protocol must operate successfully with major imaging analysis methods
that have been employed this eld such 
manual and atlas based region interest generation boundary shift integral voxel based morphometry and tensor based morphometry 
ADNI must include phantom based methods 
monitor scanner calibration across all sites over
the course the study 
Post acquisition correction certain image artifacts would implemented where applicable 
such D distortion correction for warping due
 gradient nonlinearity 
Several basic decisions about the composition the
MRI protocol for the execution phase were made the
basis the cumulative experience members the
MRI core with multisite MRI based studies information
gleaned from surveys the participating ADNI clinical
sites and the protocol guidelines established above 
Each subject will enrolled the study for year
period and multiple types data will collected 
each sampling point anticipate high research
burden each participant Moreover ADNI observational study which offers participants experimental treatment In order maximize scientic value
while minimizing patient burden the MRI core targeted
the duration the patient scanning portion the execution phase MRI protocol approximately minutes We also decided scan the ADNI phantom immediately after each patient exam rather than
decoupling phantom and human scanning Site surveys revealed that the average time window allotted for
 single MRI examination the head was approximately minutes The overall structure the ADNI
MRI execution phase was therefore targeted 
minutes patient scan time and minutes phantom scan time 
The protocol minimum had include least one
high quality high resolution D weighted sequence 
 well second acquisition that provided weighted information ascertain brain pathology A
number optional additional imaging sequences were
considered for the MRI protocol including MR spectroscopy diffusion tensor imaging arterial spin labeling 
and uid attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR sequences The MRI core decided limit the scope the
protocol two domains high quality D weighted
morphometric information and dual contrast proton
density weighted sequence for pathology detection 
This decision was based balancing the various competing considerations outlined above Options for this
high quality D weighted sequence were magnetiza 
tion prepared rapid gradient echo MP RAGE and IRFSPGR which related technique available the
GE scanners and spoiled gradient echo SPGR 
equivalent spoiled fast low angle shot FLASH for Siemens systems and fast eld echo FFE for Philips
systems We also considered approach that had
been adopted the Biomedical Informatics Research
Network BIRN study generating synthetic images
 acquiring stand alone SPGR equivalent D volumetric data sets with high and low angles 
Development Phase
During the development phase total sample
human studies with weighted D volumetric studies
 and T were obtained from various ADNI sites
and the MRI vendors Based protocol features that
worked well across vendor platforms set generic
protocols was generated and then reviewed and revised
 the MRI core group along with industry and external
advisors until consensus was reached The generic
protocols were adapted yield vendor specic protocols for the preparatory phase study based availability software options Also minor protocol differences
were introduced this stage due vendor specic
implementation differences A customized MP RAGE
pulse sequence was developed for the GE platform 
minimize vendor vendor differences At this stage 
also identied and implemented pulse sequence xes
required for the weighted IR pulse sequences 
some platforms including increased RF bandwidth 
the inversion pulse T and increased gradient area
for the end sequence spoiler Note that these customization steps resulted sequences that some
cases were non product This turn meant that ongoing support throughout the study the MRI vendors
 systems were upgraded was required At the conclusion the development phase vendor specic protocols that included the list D weighted sequences
above where appropriate vendor platform were created This protocol was then employed the preparatory phase 
Preparatory Phase Study
The ADNI MRI preparatory phase consisted mini
clinical trial the purpose which was select the D
 weighted volume sequence that would employed
 the execution phase the main ADNI study for
morphometric assessment Two endpoints were evaluated rst the ability the imaging sequence appropriately differentiate normal control subjects from AD
subjects cross sectionally and second test retest precision serial scan pairs obtained normal elderly
control subjects situation which systematic
biologic change expected Six different sites representing the relevant MRI vendor platforms and 
T participated the ADNI MRI preparatory phase 
Over these six sites normal elderly subjects and 
AD subjects were scanned once for cross sectional
comparison purposes The control subjects were
scanned again weeks later order evaluate precision Scanning sessions were performed both
phased array receive and single channel T R birdcage
RF coils for some platforms The data acquired above
were submitted for quantitative evaluation using the
techniques that will employed the main ADNI data
analyses boundary shift integral voxel based morphometry tensor based morphometry atlas based
hippocampal volumetrics and also measure graywhite matter contrast noise In addition scans were
graded qualitatively trained individual for artifacts
and general image quality four point scale none 
mild moderate and severe Each scan was graded 
several separate criteria blurring ghosting artifact intensity and homogeneity SNR susceptibility artifacts and gray white CSF contrast 
RESULTS
A total unique MRI studies subjects were
acquired during the preparatory phase Plans for analysis this data initially outlined were compromised
 the discovery additional image imperfections 
some system platforms while the preparatory phase
was progress These included inconsistent polarity 
the readout gradient between vendors that resulted 
undesirable cephalic shift fat over the brain the
base the skull Fig for sagittal acquisitions Also 
with transmit receive T R head coils the images were
unacceptably noisy Fig which was corrected 
the expense increased imaging time increasing
the number slices and the MP RAGE repetition time 
 indicated Table and illustrated Fig Finally 
some older systems imposed limit the maximal
number slices This not only degraded the SNR but
also precluded sufcient coverage Both the change 
chemical shift direction and the lifting the slice
limit required further pulse sequence modication The
protocol change increase SNR for T R birdcage coils
and pulse sequence modication for chemical shift direction were made while the preparatory phase was 
progress resulting undesirable discontinuities

The MRI core along with the external advisors met
during the annual ISMRM meeting Miami The
purpose this meeting was review data from the
preparatory phase and select nal protocol for the
execution phase ADNI A general summary the
qualitative ranking results from best worst were 
MP RAGE SPGR synthetic The different scan
types were also graded the basis quantitative
measures made the individual image analysis
groups the MRI core These data have appeared 
will appear separate independent publications 
Overall the results were mixed There was clear
indication across the different analyses performed that
one image type outperformed the other In addition 
where one image type was found better than another differences were typically small There was 
overall consensus that the MP RAGE and SPGR 
equivalent sequences outperformed the synthetic 
images The primary advantages the SPGR over MPRAGE were superior SNR and superior performance 
applications that placed premium brain CSF segmentation The advantages the MP RAGE sequence
were superior gray white contrast noise superior
performance some applications requiring cortical
segmentation and imaging times that were under 
minutes for all vendor platforms both eld strengths 
The evaluation group also noted that the SNR advantage for SPGR was large extent present birdcage
coil acquisitions T acquired with the initial unsatisfactory version the preparatory phase MP RAGE
protocol which was acquired with birdcage coils The
protocol changes illustrated Fig resulted signicant improvement the performance MP RAGE
 the various image processing algorithms The evaluation group decided extrapolate what would
have seen had the higher SNR protocol been used
throughout the entire preparatory phase when weighing the pros and cons various MR sequences 
The evaluation group unanimously selected MPRAGE the D sequence for the ADNI execution phase
 Fig The suggestion was also made acquire backto back MP RAGE sequences opposed the more
traditional approach single acquisition per exam

better MP RAGE sequence each time point based 
centralized and standardized criteria Perhaps most importantly requiring back back MP RAGE scans
should reduce the number examinations that must
 repeated due poor image quality This turn
should minimize patient burden and enhance patient
retention the study Finally both MP RAGE scans
are equivalent high quality the magnitude images

DISCUSSION
The requirements for the ADNI MRI protocol differ from
those used generate routine clinical protocol For
example while experienced radiologist often can
read through minor artifacts the automated software
programs used for the analysis typically cannot In fact 
 general rule the more fully automated the analysis
algorithm the less tolerant image imperfections Therefore smaller elds view that can lead 
wraparound artifacts the nose onto the back the
head were avoided well parallel imaging methods
like sensitivity encoding SENSE that can sometimes
result residual aliasing when there imperfect calibration Also partial space acquisition was avoided
because the associated artifacts that can result 
regions rapid susceptibility variation Consequently 
the acquisition time the MP RAGE series somewhat longer than corresponding protocol typically
used for diagnostic purposes The ADNI MRI protocol
was selected data driven manner with considerable
deliberation group experts the eld MRI 
Because the large multicenter nature ADNI MRI
techniques that were widely available the 
time frame were given preference although important
pulse sequence changes like the fat water chemical
shift direction were allowed The protocol follows set
 principles outlined the MRI core ADNI executive
committee and external advisory committee that are
 ADNI phantom The ADNI phantom spherical 
with multiple inclusions that are used both for ducial purposes and for SNR and contrast measurements Image the
bottom MRI illustrating the central SNR inclusion well
 smaller spheres for ducial measurements 
 Effect gradwarp Spherical phantom with rectilinear grid inclusion before left and after right gradwarp

meant maximize scientic utility while minimizing
research burden for participants ADNI 
In addition imaging study subjects ADNI also
acquiring images phantom the same examination period each human MRI exam Fig The
phantom was specically designed for ADNI subset
 the ADNI MRI core along with partners industry
 The ADNI phantom and accompanying analysis software will measure gradient calibration residual
nonlinearity after D distortion gradwarp correction SNR and contrast These measurements will
 used monitor scanner performance over time for
each scanner involved the ADNI study Tolerance
specications for each parameter will established
when sufcient longitudinal data from all participating
sites have been acquired and analyzed These specications will used inform sites any deviation from
tolerance limits detected individual scanners In addition the gradient calibration measures acquired 
each imaging time point will linked with its corresponding human scan This will permit retrospective
rescaling human images correct for drift discontinuities gradient calibration 
To enhance standardization across sites and platforms images acquired the ADNI study post acquisition correction certain image artifacts has been
implemented These include corrections image geometry for gradient nonlinearity D gradwarp 
corrections for intensity nonuniformity due nonuniform receiver coil sensitivity and correction image intensity nonuniformity due other causes such
 wave effects T These corrections are system
specic For example only systems with apparent gradient nonlinearity undergo this correction and the implementation D gradwarp equivalent specic
for each gradient conguration Fig Similarly correction for intensity inhomogeneity due nonuniform
sensitivity multiarray receiver coils was implemented
for those systems which the manufacturer did not
provide this feature product the inception the
study Fig In addition the uncorrected original
image les the images with all the corrections and
some with intermediate steps will available the

The approach standardization across sites and
platforms the MRI protocol and acquisition parameters for each imaging sequence post acquisition correction image artifacts and phantom based monitoring the instruments themselves could extended 
other multisite trials including those other research
areas This approach will minimize variation the data
collected due technical nonuniformity and thus maximize across site sensitivity true biologic variation In
large multisite studies where the role MRI capture relevant phenotypic information all study participants the importance standardization supersedes the natural impulse MR scientists employ
the most cutting edge MR methods that usually will
