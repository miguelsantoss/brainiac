There are estimated million people with
dementia worldwide with this gure expected 
double every years the population ages In
response this challenge number countries have
committed long term national dementia strategies 
which include improving timely diagnosis For
many patients there are delays diagnosis dementia preventing them from accessing relevant care services information and treatment Patients with
unrecognised cognitive impairment present range
 clinical settings often with health concerns unrelated dementia one study those aged
over years admitted acute medical admissions unit had dementia with only half having been
diagnosed prior admission 
The most common causes dementia are
Alzheimers disease AD vascular disease several
forms dementia with Lewy bodies DLB and frontotemporal lobar degeneration FTLD but there are
many others Accurate and early diagnosis has
considerable implications for the patient terms 
prognosis and management and will increasingly
important and when disease modifying treatments
become available Currently postmortem examination brain tissue remains the only denitive
means establishing diagnosis most cases 
Molecular biomarkers are now available provide
support for diagnosis AD life for example 
amyloid imaging with positron emission tomography PET and cerebrospinal uid CSF analysis
 amyloid A and tau however these
markers are mainly research tools and denitive
blood tests are still lacking Until these techniques
become widely available structural neuroimaging 
combination with clinical assessment offers the
greatest utility improving diagnostic accuracy
during life 
The UK National Institute Health and Care
Excellence NICE European and US diagnostic
 recommend that structural imaging
 non contrast enhanced CT ideally MRI should
 performed the evaluation patients with suspected dementia In recognition advances 
imaging research the justication for this has
shifted from the exclusion surgical pathology
 cerebral tumours although still relevant 
the inclusion features that help support clinical diagnosis the underlying cause the
dementia MRI offers number advantages over
 and the imaging modality choice identifying diagnostic imaging features While
 structural imaging features have perfect sensitivity
and specicity for any given diagnosis there are 
number which provide positive predictive value and
help narrow the differential diagnosis the most
likely underlying pathologies By describing these
characteristic MRI ndings the context structured algorithm this article aims provide clinicians
with practical means extracting useful imaging
features common dementias order improve
diagnostic accuracy While neuroradiology expertise
 invaluable accurate scan interpretation there 
much that non radiologist can gain from focused
and structured approach scan analysis

 presented gure and discussed detail below and
expanded gures and Using the predominant imaging features the most common causes dementia the diagnosis with
the greatest likelihood presented presents mostly
pathologically proven imaging examples many the features
described 
THE ALGORITHM
Exclusion surgical pathology
The exclusion structural brain lesion potentially amenable
 surgical intervention should the starting point when
reviewing structural imaging These include tumour meningioma glioma subdural haematoma arteriovenous malformation and hydrocephalus Idiopathic normal pressure
hydrocephalus should also considered although imaging
markers have not yet proved sensitive enough for reliable
diagnosis 
Assessment signal change
Signal intensity within single tissue type should reasonably
uniform MRI The presence regions hyperintensity 
hypointensity within the tissue typically reects pathology In
the context suspected dementia punctate conuent
regions signal change within white matter deep grey
matter are most commonly associated with vascular pathology 
but rarely and the correct clinical context may also indicate
inammatory metabolic infective processes The prevalence
 vascular cognitive impairment VCI second only AD 
They share many risk factors including increasing prevalence
with age and therefore many patients vascular and degenerative pathology coexist The exact interaction between neurodegenerative and vascular pathology debated but critically for
the patient important that vascular risk factors are
managed and treated Differentiating the relative contribution 
vascular from neurodegenerative pathology the cause 
patients cognitive problems common clinical problem
where MRI plays central role If MRI not possible CT can
also used relatively effectively evaluate the presence and
extent cerebrovascular disease with changes white matter
appearing hypodense 
Clinical and research guidelines require imaging evidence 
cerebrovascular disease for diagnosis vascular dementia
 VaD VCI made In the absence evidence 
vascular damage MRI vascular cause for cognitive impairment very unlikely conversely extensive vascular changes are
very likely produce signicant cognitive decits The clinical difculty lies determining whether mild moderate
degree vascular changes sufcient explain the clinical
picture particularly older people where mixed vascular and
neurodegenerative pathology more common While remains
important address treatable vascular risk factors treating 
potential neurodegenerative condition for example with cholinesterase inhibition should not overlooked Serial imaging
may help identify the relative contributions and there some
evidence that the rate cognitive decline may provide further
evidence the underlying pathology with patients with VaD
typically declining slower rate than patients with neurodegenerative pathology 
 weighted images including FLAIR are most useful 
detecting ischaemic changes while susceptibility

Cerebral atrophy assessment
Atrophy the principal imaging nding neurodegenerative
dementias and typically best identied weighted images
and assessed combination axial sagittal and coronal
views Despite degree overlap among disease subtypes 
some patterns atrophy are indicative specic underlying
pathology however such ndings should considered the
context the patients age and clinical examination 
sets out approach the assessment cerebral atrophy 
Focal lobar atrophy
Atrophy with focal lobar predominance useful starting
point help narrow the differential diagnosis patients with
cognitive decline In particular asymmetrical pattern 
atrophy left greater than right vice versa more anterior
than posterior atrophy more suggestive underlying FTLD
pathology rather than AD pathology 
 Frontal lobe Disproportionate frontal lobe atrophy associated with FTLD pathology but does not differentiate
between different FTLD histopathologies Picks disease
 corticobasal degeneration CBD Patients with behavioural variant FTD bvFTD may have symmetrical asymmetrical frontal atrophy with without additional temporal
lobe atrophy Despite typically asymmetric clinical
presentation symmetrical frontal lobe atrophy the predominant imaging nding patients with dementia due CBD
pathology However many patients with clinical diagnosis corticobasal syndrome are found have pathology
other than CBD postmortem which may account for
some the variability reported the literature Currently
imaging features are not included the diagnostic criteria
for CBD Left sided posterior frontoinsular atrophy which
may limited subtle widening the left sylvian ssure 
 typically found cases progressive non uent
 see gure 
 Temporal lobe Asymmetric temporal atrophy most commonly due FTLD pathology but can also due AD 
The semantic dementia variant FTD has characteristic
pattern loss typically left greater than right focal anterior
temporal atrophy particularly involving the temporal pole
 which progresses knife edge atrophy the amygdala and
anterior hippocampus and often selective loss anterior
fusiform gyrus with relative preservation more posterior
structures Asymmetrical atrophy the right temporal lobe with similar distribution SD may also occur 
most commonly presenting bvFTD and often with additional features prosopagnosia and topographical
memory impairment While the asymmetry usually dramatic SD and the right temporal variant bvFTD both
temporal lobes usually become involved and over time the
pattern atrophy may start look more symmetrical see
gure Logopenic aphasia LPA also associated
with greater left sided atrophy the temporal lobe although
 contrast SD the pattern atrophy extends more posteriorly than SD predominantly affecting the posterior perisylvian and temporoparietal areas angular gyrus posterior
middle temporal gyrus superior temporal gyrus and superior
temporal sulcus see gure Unlike the majority 
clinical syndromes associated with asymmetrical pattern 
atrophy LPA typically found result AD pathology Nonetheless the presence anterior posterior
atrophy gradient the temporal lobe suggestive FTLD
rather than AD and can usefully assessed scrolling
posterior anterior through coronal slices the temporal lobe 
 Parietal Occipital lobe Posterior cortical atrophy PCA 
involving the parietal occipital cortex usually the result 
underlying AD pathology see gure however the differential diagnosis includes CBD DLB and other less common
causes PCA with additional medial temporal lobe MTL 
atrophy supports AD the most likely cause however the
MTL may initially relatively spared posterior variant
AD PCA especially early onset cases Visual rating 
posterior atrophy combination with MTL atrophy rating
has been reported help discriminate AD from FTD and
AD from normal ageing with sensitivity and specicity Gross frontoparietal atrophy extending into
the temporal lobe conned single hemisphere has been
described patients with progranulin mutations and should
 considered the presence strong family history 
Focal hippocampal atrophy
Hippocampal atrophy the most established imaging biomarker
 AD and result has now been incorporated diagnostic criteria The sensitivity and specicity visual rating 
MTL atrophy are approximately when mild AD cases are
compared with elderly control subjects Relative preservation 
the MTL suggested means distinguishing DLB from AD
 group level however this may not true older patients
 patients with advanced DLB and may not reliable individual see gure particularly many patients with DLB
pathology also have AD pathology postmortem Dopamine
transporter imaging offers greater utility distinguishing DLB
from AD Hippocampal atrophy also feature hippocampal sclerosis and hyperintensity the hippocampus 
FLAIR images makes this diagnosis more likely Focal and often
severe atrophy affecting the anteromedial temporal lobes has
been described tau mutation microtubule associated protein
tau MAPT carriers with striking loss the amygdala parahippocampus and hippocampal heads see gure 
Although more often asymmetrical bvFTD may also demonstrate
symmetrical MTL atrophy and frontal lobe atrophy 
Infratentorial atrophy
Progressive supranuclear palsy PSP can present dementia 
often with frontal features occasionally with progressive nonuent aphasia Midbrain atrophy characteristic PSP and has
been described having hummingbird appearance midsagittal slices see gure with axial slices demonstrating the 
called mickey mouse sign Other imaging features PSP
include dilation the third ventricle and atrophy the red
nucleus Frontal atrophy may subtle marked PSP 
Pontocerebellar atrophy may indicate other neurodegenerative
conditions such multiple system atrophy which rare cases
may present with cognitive phenotype 
Generalised atrophy
Global volume loss without focal lobar atrophy common
and non specic nding structural MRI studies normal
ageing and dementia and can sometimes difcult determine where normal ageing ends and pathological atrophy
begins Symmetrical generalised atrophy left right anterior posterior typically seen AD and DLB and may also
accompany white matter changes patients with vascular
disease 
Harper L J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry doi 
Neurodegeneration
No imaging abnormality demonstrated
When all stages fail reveal any abnormalities beyond what 
expected for age the scan reported within normal limits 
This does not course exclude dementia nor does rule out 
neurodegenerative cause particularly the clinical syndrome 
mild If clinical suspicion persists SPECT single photon emission computed tomography PET scan can helpful look
for changes cerebral perfusion metabolism repeat MRI
scanning months Normal imaging particularly with
repeat imaging after greater than months should however
prompt consideration non neurodegenerative cause including psychiatric conditions In the future molecular diagnostic
indices such CSF A amyloid PET scanning may
increasingly used conrm exclude the presence AD
 amyloid pathology these cases 
CONCLUSION
Clinical diagnosis the cause cognitive complaints 
decline can difcult Nonetheless accurate and timely diagnosis increasingly important guide management and 
provide appropriate information and support As reected 
current diagnostic guidelines structural imaging can provide
valuable positive well negative predictive information and
the algorithm described here based reported imaging features with greatest diagnostic value designed provide systematic aid help differentiate between the different causes 
dementia It course important that imaging ndings are
interpreted the correct clinical context and that the limitations making individual diagnosis the basis imaging
ndings are recognised 
While the diagnostic approach describe here based 
visual assessment structural imaging techniques such volumetric quantication brain structures and automated classier
algorithms may play complementary role future clinical
practice Brain volumetry already used extensively research
 and clinical and has the potential used 
the single patient level help support diagnosis and monitor
disease progression 
In the meantime structural imaging cognitive cases can
provide easily accessible clinically useful information that can
 realistically assessed the non specialist Using systematic
approach such set out this article may help clinicians 
evaluating their own scans rather than relying radiological
reports alone and ultimately support the diagnostic process 
Further work however required evaluate the sensitivity
and specicity imaging signatures for neurodegenerative
pathology
