Introduction
Parkinsons disease PD even early stage
impairs performance tests measuring functions
mediated the fronto striatal systems such 
spatial working memory SWM and attentional setshifting This impairment may reflect the severity
 striatal dopaminergic and impaired functions
 fronto striatal loops However PD the
frontal dopamine projections are also adversely
affected suggesting that the progressive dysfunction
 striatal and frontal dopamine transmission may
both contribute for the impaired performance 
frontal tests It relevant note that more
severely disabled PD patients are also less accurate
 tests sensitive dysfunction hippocampus and
anatomically related medial temporal lobe cortical
structures such delayed matching sample test
 DMTS Dopaminergic defect may not contribute
for impaired DMTS memory accuracy since L dopa
withdrawal did not further aggravate DMTS defect

We designed the present study investigate the
hypothesis that impaired declarative memory performance non demented PD patients associated

for least months No subjects received anticholinergic medication during the study period for
 months before the initiation the study In addition cognitive testing and routine clinical MRI
analysis the investigation the subjects included
clinical neurological examination and laboratory tests
 exclude medical conditions that could impair cognitive functioning 
Cognitive testing included computerized neuropsychological tests SWM intra dimensional extra
dimensional ID ED attentional set shifting DMTS 
motor screening A computerized system with 
touch sensitive video screen was used These tests
provide non verbal stimuli and record responses
using the touch sensitive screen The subjects were
first familiarized with the testing procedure letting
them perform motor screening task which they
were trained point accurately the screen A standard paper and pencil word list learning test was
alsi assessed self ordered test working

introduced which point new exemplars the two
dimensions are given and the subject must now learn
 new discrimination criterion intra dimensional

the test introduces extra dimensional shift EDS 
where again new exemplars the two dimensions
are presented but this time the subject must shift
his her attention the dimension which was
previously irrelevant EDS followed finally 
reversal this rule extra dimensional reversal 
EDR The EDS akin category shift the
WCST For each stage the test the main measure
was the stage successfully attainted The main
measures were the IDR and EDS stages that cannot
and can separate respectively the performance accuracy mild and severe PD patients 
Visual memory was tested with the DMTS In
the DMTS the subject must match patterns either
 delayed simultaneous condition In the simultaneous condition the sample and all the choice
stimuli are present the screen simultaneously and
the subject must select the choice pattern that matches
the sample exactly In the final condition there are
delays and between the presentations the sample pattern and the choice stimuli 
The subjects must touch the choice stimulus that
exactly matches the sample If the first response 
incorrect the subject may choose again until the
correct answer reached all choice stimuli have
been selected There are three practice trials and then
 test trials during which delay condition 
Hippocampal atrophy demented Parkinsons disease patients
 delay are counterbalanced A short break 
allowed after test trials To discourage subjects
from encoding the sample pattern the basis one
quadrant only all four choice patterns have one
quadrant common with the sample The outcome
measure the percentage correct responses 
different delays 
Verbal memory was measured with list learning
test The list learning test consisted nine word
list that was read aloud patients three times 
Immediately after the tester had finished reading the
words the patient repeated many words possible
 immediate recall This was repeated three times and
 maximum correct score was words repetitions words The patient was asked again
repeat the words min later delayed recall 
maximum correct score nine words During this
break other cognitive tests were assessed The number
 total correct and false words was measured 
Furthermore the word list was divided into three
parts study the serial position effect primacy
words intermediate words and recency
words and examine detail what component word list learning affected PD 
The subjects were scanned with T Magnetom
 Siemens Erlagen Germany using standard head
coil and coronal D gradient echo sequence MPRAGE TR sms TE TI flip angle
 FOV matrix one acquisition This resulted weighted partitions
with slice thickness The partitions
covering the hippocampus were reformatted into
 contiguous slices perpendicular the long axis
 the hippocampus The term hippocampus included
the dentate gyrus the hippocampus proper and the
subicular complex The uncal portion the rostral
hippocampus that located ventral the caudal
amygdala was included into the hippocampus The
caudal end the hippocampus was determined from
the section which the fornices were still detectable
 their full length The fornices were not however
included the volume the hippocampus We used
standard anatomical atlases the human brain 
guidelines determine the boundaries the amygdala auld hippocampus oblique coronal MRI
sections The boundaries the region interest
were outlined trackball driven cursor The
number voxels within the region was integrated
 using program developed house for standard
work console Every second slice was included
 the analysis which reduced the number slices
 for hippocampus We calculated the results
using normalized volumes the amygdala and
hippocampus volume the hippocampus the area
 both hemispheres MRI taken the level the
anterior commissure 
The group and task difficulty effects and group 
difficulty interaction were analyzed with repeated
measures ANOVA The test one way ANOVA
and Bonferroni post hoc test and Wilcoxon signed
ranks tests were used

Hippocampal atrophy correlated with impaired
memory scoring PD patients We also confirmed
previous evidence suggesting that dopaminergic dysfunction may cause impaired SWM and attentional
set shifting accuracy the severity motor symptoms correlated with these fronto striatal functions 
Previous clinical and experimental results support
our finding that impaired memory performance 
DMTS and list learning tests PD patients least
partly due hippocampal dysfunction First humans
may employ verbal strategies perform the
DMTS test and actually form associations between
verbal cues and the sample figures employing paired
associates learning strategy that requires hippocampal
processing Second supra span list learning
test and recall these memory items after delay
filled with distracting activity other cognitive tests 
depends hippocampal processing Indeed surgical
excision the medial temporal lobe structures
during epilepsy and neurodegeneration 
Alzheimers disrupts list learning and
impairs the ability retrieve the words from the
beginning the list However the defective
DMTS and word list test scoring may not only
due degeneration the hippocampus several
neurotransmitter systems are affected during the
progression PD For example dysfunction 
cholinergic cells the basal forebrain noradrenergic locus coeruleus may impair attention and certain
forms declarative memory functions more
advanced PD patients 
Some non specific factor such disease duration 
depression medication age unlikely explain
the inferior delayed memory performance the MI
severe PD patients did not differ these measures
Hippocampal atrophy demented Parkinsons disease patients
from the MU severe PD patient Furthermore 
correlation was observed between depression scoring 
dopaminergic medication disease duration age and
memory performance 
In conclusion our present data described that
some PD patients that suffered from severe motor
disability also had delay dependent visual and
verbal memory failure that was associated with mild
atrophy the hippocampus On the contrary the
defect fronto striatal measures did not correlate
with the hippocampal atrophy but was related the
severity motor dysfunction This and earlier
evidence suggests that the dopamine cell loss the
midbrain contributes for the defect fronto striatal
functions PD patients Furthermore failure 
memory retention occurs less frequently PD
patients and this least some extent due 
hippocampal dysfunction 
Conclusion
Parkinsons disease characterized impaired
function fronto striatal loops that results from
loss dopaminergic cells the substantia nigra 
Impaired activity the fronto striatal systems
disrupts spatial working memory planning and attentional set shifting early stage the disease 
However some PD patients suffer from retention
delay dependent impairment the longer the delay
 the worse memory memory that not likely
 result from dopaminergic dysfunction Our results
found that the severity hippocampal atrophy
correlated with impaired memory accuracy PD
patients
