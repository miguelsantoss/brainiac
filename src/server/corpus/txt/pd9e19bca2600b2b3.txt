ABSTRACT
Objective To determine whether cognitive impairment Parkinson disease PD and Alzheimer
disease AD derives from the same network pathology 
Methods We analyzed F fluorodeoxyglucose PET scans from patients with AD and agematched healthy controls from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and scanned 
additional patients with AD and healthy controls The Feinstein Institute for Medical
Research derive AD related metabolic pattern ADRP analogous our previously established PD cognition related pattern PDCP and PD motor related pattern PDRP We computed
individual subject expression values for ADRP and PDCP patients with PD and correlated
summary scores for cognitive functioning with network expression We also evaluated changes 
ADRP and PDCP expression separate group patients with PD scanned serially over year period 
Results Analysis revealed significant AD related metabolic topography characterized covarying metabolic reductions the hippocampus parahippocampal gyrus and parietal and temporal association regions Expression ADRP but not PDCP was elevated both AD groups and
correlated with worse cognitive summary scores Patients with PD showed slight ADRP expression due topographic overlap with the network underlying PD motor related pattern degeneration but only their PDCP expression values increased cognitive function and executive
performance declined Longitudinal data PD disclosed analogous dissociation network
expression 
Conclusions Cognitive dysfunction PD associated with specific brain network that 
largely spatially and functionally distinct from that seen relation AD Neurology

the former Whether AD contributes the
cognitive deficits PD thus remains unsettled question 
The fact that neuronal dysfunction neurodegenerative diseases propagated along
discrete networks makes such questions amenable neuroimaging approaches We and

that akinesia rigidity PD correlates with the

Patients with PD We quantified ADRP expression values

Brain Bank criteria for idiopathic PD These patients had pure

neuropsychological data for these participants 
We classified patients with PD having dementia not having dementia according the Dementia Rating had

In addition compared the progression ADRP and

measures from the normal reference sample used pattern
identification We used analogous procedures quantify PDCP
expression the same scans each the testing cases To
accord with previously published results PDCP expression values
were scored with respect values from the group normal
controls men and women age years used
for reference prior studies 
Network correlates neuropsychological test performance 
We evaluated the relationship between network expression and cognitive performance the combined ADNI patient
cohort and the FIMR PD sample For the ADNI participants 
used the summary score data for memory and executive functioning
provided the database Because the ADNI database does not
provide summary score for language function constructed
 language index score based the measures that were available
for each participant standardized scored with respect agecorrected normative values and averaged individual scores form
 language summary index We used similar approach compute
summary scores for memory executive function and language 
members the cross sectional PD sample 
Data analysis We assessed differences ADRP expression
between patients with AD and controls separately for the ADNI
 and FIMR testing sets and for the PD
and age matched normal reference groups scanned 
FIMR Subject scores computed each the subgroups
within this PD sample PD MCI PD MCI PD MCI
 and PDD were separately compared corresponding
control values Differences ADRP expression between
patients and controls each testing sample were assessed with
Student tests and differences ADRP expression across the PD
subgroups were assessed with way analysis variance
 ANOVA followed post hoc Dunnett tests for multiple
comparisons We used identical statistical procedures assess
group differences PDCP expression each testing sample 
Potential network subgroup interaction effects the PD
data were evaluated with way repeated measures ANOVA
 RMANOVA with network the within subject variable and
subgroup the between subject variable 
We used similar approach evaluate the neuropsychological summary scores for the disease groups We constructed separate way ANOVA models for each cognitive domain 
identify differences across the PD subgroups values were
adjusted for multiple comparisons with the Dunnett correction 
Relationships between individual subject ADRP and PDCP
expression values and the neuropsychological summary scores
were evaluated separately the AD and PD groups calculating
the Pearson product moment correlations 
To compare changes ADRP and PDCP expression over
time the longitudinal PD cohort analyzed the subject
scores using way RMANOVA with network and time 
within subject variables If significant network time interaction effect was evident the data used way RMANOVA 
assess changes over time the expression each network All
statistical analyses were performed with SAS for Windows
