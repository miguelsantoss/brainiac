Background While most patients with mild cognitive
impairment MCI transition Alzheimer disease AD 
others develop non AD dementia remain the MCI state 
 improve 
Objective To test the following hypotheses smaller hip 
pocampal volumes predict conversion MCI AD 
whereas larger hippocampal volumes predict cognitive
stability and improvement and patients with MCI who
convert AD have greater atrophy the hippocampal subfield and subiculum 
Design Prospective longitudinal cohort study 
Setting University CaliforniaLos Angeles Alzhei 
mers Disease Research Center 
Patients We followed MCI subjects clinically and
neuropsychologically for years 
AD MCI remained stable MCI and 
improved MCI Patients with MCI had smaller
left and smaller right mean hippocampal volumes

Patients with MCI had significantly smaller hippocampi than MCI patients left right Volumetric analyses showed trend for greater hippocampal

volume loss After permutation tests corrected for multiple comparison the atrophy maps showed significant
difference the right Subicular differences were seen
between MCI and MCI patients and MCI and
MCI patients Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed the group effect highly significant and independent age hemisphere and Mini Mental State
Examination scores baseline 
Main Outcome Measure Baseline regional hippocampal atrophy was analyzed with region interest and
 dimensional hippocampal mapping techniques 
Conclusions Smaller hippocampi and specifically 
and subicular involvement are associated with increased risk for conversion from MCI AD Patients with
MCI tend have larger hippocampal volumes and relative preservation both the subiculum and

The MCI outcomes correlate with annualized hippocampal atrophy rates The
annual atrophy rates for those who remain stable MCI and for those
who develop AD MCI The latter strikingly similar the 
observed AD Some researchers have
found association between smaller hippocampi and the observed annual conversion rate from MCI AD whereas oth

standard neuroanatomical atlas was consulted Tracings included the hippocampus proper dentate gyrus and subiculum 
All traces were made blinded fashion with respect the subjects age sex and cognitive outcome Region interest volumetric data were extracted and analyzed statistically 
The hippocampal contours were split into top and bottom

recorded the variation between corresponding surface points 
A medial core central line threading down the long axis the
hippocampus was computed for each hippocampus Hippocampal radial distance measures the distance from the medial core each point the hippocampal surface model were
estimated These values were used generate individual distance maps that were combined across subjects produce group

Using computational anatomy approach similar 
ours Wang and Csernansky compared hippocampal volume and shape between subjects with

deformation maps accurately distinguished subjects
with AD from healthy controls The AD group had

patients who later developed AD We found strong correlations between greater atrophy and verbal memory

Some studies find that proportion MCI subjects

study that includes the whole spectrum clinical outcomes cognitive worsening improvement and stability Patients with reversible MCI seem have and

Our study has several limitations Despite the small
sample size were able demonstrate significant morphological differences between the groups A larger MCI
patient sample will better define hippocampal regions that
correlate best with cognitive outcomes and determine the
specificity and sensitivity our methods predicting cognitive outcome patients with newly diagnosed MCI Without direct pathological validation the interpretation the
subregional involvement remains arbitrary The subregional boundaries used are similar those proposed
 other research groups Nevertheless what interpret subicular involvement may reflect changes
 another hippocampal subregion Our study focused 
amnestic MCI Our findings cannot generalized all
MCI patients especially those with the nonamnestic subtype A large prospective study that follows patients with
all MCI subtypes over time needed address the etiological clinical and prognostic questions that remain unanswered
