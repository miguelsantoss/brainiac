Meta analysis individuals identifies new
susceptibility loci for Alzheimers disease
Eleven susceptibility loci for late onset Alzheimers disease
 LOAD were identified previous studies however large
portion the genetic risk for this disease remains unexplained 
We conducted large two stage meta analysis genomewide association studies GWAS individuals European
ancestry In stage used genotyped and imputed data
 SNPs perform meta analysis previously
published GWAS data sets consisting Alzheimers
disease cases and controls In stage SNPs
were genotyped and tested for association independent
set Alzheimers disease cases and controls 
In addition the APOE locus encoding apolipoprotein E 
 loci reached genome wide significance P the
combined stage and stage analysis which are newly
associated with Alzheimers disease 
Alzheimers disease devastating neurological disorder primarily
affecting the elderly The disease manifests with progressive deterioration cognitive functions leading loss autonomy The APOE
gene encoding apolipoprotein E major genetic risk factor for
Alzheimers Previous GWAS individuals European
ancestry identified nine other genomic regions associated with
 Recently rare susceptibility variant was The search for additional genetic risk factors requires largescale meta analysis GWAS increase statistical power Under the
banner I GAP International Genomics Alzheimers Project 
conducted meta analysis GWAS samples European ancestry
totaling cases and controls stage followed 
genotyping SNPs showing moderate evidence association
 P stage independent sample that included 
cases and controls stage 
In the stage meta analysis used data from four consortia the
Alzheimers Disease Genetic Consortium ADGC the Cohorts for
Heart and Aging Research Genomic Epidemiology CHARGE 
Consortium the European Alzheimers Disease Initiative EADI and
the Genetic and Environmental Risk Alzheimers Disease GERAD 
Consortium Table Online Methods Supplementary Table and
Supplementary Note We used European population reference EUR 
haplotype data from the Genomes Project interim release
based sequence data freeze from August and phased haplotypes from December impute genotypes for 
SNPs per data set We excluded SNPs that did not pass quality control

biases terms imputation our discovery data sets genotyping
 our replication data sets data not shown suggesting potential
statistical fluctuation across our populations explanation for
the lack replication However recent data suggest that genetically
determined decreased expression might reduce Alzheimers
disease risk and interfere with amyloid peptide dysfunction thought central late onset forms Alzheimers Further investigations independent case control studies will
thus required confirm refute the association with
Alzheimers disease 
The newly associated loci reinforce the importance some previously suspected pathways such APP and and
tau and pathology Several candidate genes 
these loci are involved pathways already shown enriched
for association signal Alzheimers disease such 
immune response and inflammation D
and C which also supported the described association
 Alzheimers disease with ref and refs cell
migration B and lipid transport and endocytosis 
Our results also suggest the existence new pathways underlying
Alzheimers disease These pathways could include hippocampal synaptic function C and B cytoskeletal function and axonal
transport and regulation gene expression
and post translational modification proteins and microglial and
myeloid cell function D 
Examining the genetic effect attributable all the associated
loci demonstrated that the most strongly associated SNPs 
each locus other than APOE had population attributable fractions
 PAFs preventive fractions between the stage 
sample Supplementary Table Strong efforts sequencing
and post GWAS analyses will now required fully characterize the candidate genes and functional variants responsible for the
association these GWAS identified loci with Alzheimers disease
risk and understand their exact roles the pathophysiology

Imputation and SNP selection for stage analysis After quality control
criteria were finalized for each individual and each sample collection SNPs
with call rates were excluded Supplementary Note 
 ref MaCH software Supplementary Table was used
 impute the genotypes all participants with haplotypes derived from samples European ancestry the Genome Project interim release
based the sequence data freeze from August and phased haplotypes
from December In each data set SNPs with info score quality
estimates less than indicated MaCH respectively
 with these two quality estimates described equivalent were excluded
from analyses Similarly SNPs with MAF were also excluded After
these procedures maximum SNPs were retained that were
present least data set 
In each case control data set the association LOAD with genotype dosage was analyzed logistic regression model including covariates for age 
sex and principal components adjust for possible population stratification
 Supplementary Table For the three CHARGE cohorts with incident
Alzheimers disease data Cox proportional hazards models were used The four
consortia used different but analogous software for these analyses PLINK 
 R Supplementary Table Three these tools
were applied the EADI data set for quality control and very similar results
were observed After the exclusion SNPs showing logistic regression coefficient P value equal the maximum number SNPs any
data set was Each consortium uploaded summarized results for each
SNP internal I GAP website for access members each consortium 
SNPs genotyped imputed least Alzheimers disease cases and
 control samples were included the meta analysis This threshold
represented the best compromise between maximizing the total number 
SNPs and maximizing the number samples which the given SNP was
present Indeed analyzing all SNPs available least one study could have
greatly increased the risk false positives On the other hand studying SNPs
only present all studies could have led the removal SNPs potential
interest even those SNPs could have reached adequate statistical power 
 more limited number data sets false negatives This approach allowed
 increase homogeneity between studies for some SNPs excluding poor
quality data present only limited number data sets small size This last
selection step led final number SNPs stage analysis 
iSelect microarray design and stage SNP quality control SNPs associated with Alzheimers disease risk and exhibiting P value stage 
analysis were selected for replication A list SNPs was submitted 
 devoted Illumina website develop iSelect microarray A total 
SNPs exhibiting Illumina score superior equal were selected for
microarray production During the Illumina production process SNPs
failed oligonucleotide synthesis leading final number SNPs
for which genotyping was attempted Genotyping failure led the further
exclusion additional SNPs result the SNPs having 
intensity signal not being polymorphic iii only
being found heterozygous state having mismatched alleles
compared Genomes Project data Finally several quality control measures were applied the remaining SNPs detect potential
biases genotyping We first tested for discrepancies allelic frequency
between the Genomes Project EUR reference panel and stage data 
Allele frequencies for stage data were estimated controls see

Other SNP quality control steps were performed separately data for each
country A SNP was considered low genotyping quality country data
set had missing genotype data for more than the individuals 
the P value for the Hardy Weinberg test controls was lower than 
 the P value for the test for differences missingness between cases and
controls was lower than see Supplementary Table for differences
 missingness assessed for suggestive and significant hits across European
populations These quality control steps led the removal SNPs with
low genotyping quality data from all countries 
After SNP quality control SNPs were considered high genotyping quality least country and were analyzed stage For imputed
data sets SNPs were considered low imputation quality their info
score was 
Of note the SNPs that were unable successfully genotype 
only were not tagged another successfully genotyped variant 
and associated with P value least times higher than that the missing SNP Because the vast majority the untagged SNPs exhibited stage 
P values between and the likelihood missing true
association was considered low 
Stage sample quality control The iSelect microarray contained SNPs 
 which were devoted stage These supplementary SNPs included
various genetic data that allowed further refine our quality control processes On the basis data for all these SNPs excluded individuals who
had more than missing genotypes showed discrepancy between reported
sex and sex estimated the basis genetic data genetic sex showed
evidence non European ancestry Duplicated and related individuals were
identified Supplementary Table Briefly discrepancies sex were examined using genetic sex estimated PLINK SNPs chromosome X 
We also removed individuals from single plate for whom abnormal
number discrepancies sex were observed suggesting that sample mixing
had occurred Using panel ancestry informative markers AIMs 
performed principal component analysis PCA HapMap data with the
function SMARTPCA from EIGENSOFT software For each country 
individuals were projected onto the first two PCA axes define their genetic
ancestry Individuals with evidence non European ancestry were then identified applying Bayesian clustering approach their coordinates 
the first two axes Identity descent IBD was computed for all pairs 
individuals using PLINK and individuals pair with IBD greater than 
were considered duplicates If clinical data for duplicated individuals
were discordant both individuals were excluded Otherwise the individual
with the greater proportion missing genotype was excluded Similarly IBD
was computed for all pairs individuals data from each country separately 
using autosomal SNPs with MAF and selected minimize LD 
Individuals pairs with IBD greater than were considered related
and were iteratively removed obtain sample unrelated individuals
within each country data set 
Finally individuals with missing clinical data and controls less than
 years age were excluded from the analysis After sample quality

Each consortium performed independent stage meta analysis after downloading the data files available the I GAP website Two software packages were used for meta analysis and Very similar
results were generated independently the software used and expected 
perfect matching was observed between the analyses undertaken each
