The highly potent Botulinum neurotoxins (BoNT) are successful drugs to treat neuromuscular disorders. Efforts are being made to further reduce the injected BoNT dose and to lengthen the interval between treatments. Detailed knowledge of the BoNT structure-activity relationship (SAR) allows combining the best features of the different BoNT serotypes. Of all seven BoNT serotypes A-G, BoNT/A displays the highest potency despite low neuronal binding affinity, while BoNT/B exhibits much higher affinity. Recently, a new BoNT/AB hybrid (AABB) was constructed comprising the catalytic and translocation domain of BoNT/A and the 50kDa cell binding domain of BoNT/B. Here, we compared BoNT/A wild-type (AAAA) and AABB with regard to ex vivo potency and in vivo potency, efficacy and duration of action using the mouse phrenic nerve hemidiaphragm assay and the murine running wheel assay, respectively. The ex vivo potency of AABB was found to be 8.4-fold higher than that of AAAA. For the latter, two and 5 pg each of AAAA and AABB, respectively, were bilaterally injected into the calf muscles and mouse running wheel performance was automatically monitored during the following weeks to determine potency, efficacy and duration. Mice displayed a dose-dependent impairment of running performance. AABB showed potency, efficacy and duration equal to AAAA demonstrating successful exchange of the cell binding domain. AABB might combine the higher potency and longer duration of BoNT/A with the target specificity for the autonomic nervous system of BoNT/B. AABB might therefore constitute an improved treatment option for acetylcholine-mediated autonomic disorders such as hypersalivation or hyperhidrosis.
