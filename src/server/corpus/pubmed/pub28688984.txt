Non-operative management is a common initial treatment for adult spinal deformity (ASD) patients despite reported superiority of surgery with regard to outcomes. Ineffective medical care is a large source of resource drain on the health system. Characterization of ASD patients likely to elect for operative treatment from nonoperative management may allow for more efficient patient counseling and cost savings.
