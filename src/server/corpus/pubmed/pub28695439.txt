The quantitative study assessed subjective burden, depression, and the moderating effect of social support in mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in India. Seventy mothers were interviewed using a structured interview schedule, which measured their subjective burden, depression, and social support from family, friends, and significant others. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and multiple regression analysis with interaction terms. Half of the mothers in the study reported depression of clinical significance. Higher subjective burden significantly predicted higher depression. Of the three sources of support, only medium/high family support had a direct impact on depression and also moderated the impact of the subjective burden of depression. Implications for practice and policy are discussed.
