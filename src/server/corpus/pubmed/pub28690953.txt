With the increasing number of survivors with congenital heart disease (CHD) reaching adulthood, it is important for the clinician to be familiar with the various surgical options performed in this growing patient population. We describe the case of a 65-year-old female who presented with hypoxia and right-to-left shunting following a surgical repair of an atrial septal defect (ASD) secundum and anomalous pulmonary veins with a partial atrial diversion procedure in childhood. The use of multimodality cardiovascular imaging using echocardiography, computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, and invasive cardiac catheterization was complementary in the preoperative diagnosis and management of this unique baffling situation.
