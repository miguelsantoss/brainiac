Statistical analysis
As hippocampal neurons project the entorhinal cortex which turn projects the whole 
cortex anticipate that neuronal degeneration

DISCUSSION
In this study have demonstrated for the first
time that levels microglial activation voxel level
 the whole cortex medial temporal lobe and hip 
pocampus measured using C R PET 
were inversely correlated with hippocampal volume
and hippocampal glucose uptake AD and PDD
subjects This study provides further credence the
hypothesis that microglial activation detected with
 C R PET correlated with markers
 neuronal damage reduction hippocampal
volume and glucose metabolism This finding further supports the role neuroinflammation and
microglial activation neurodegenerative diseases
 The spatial agreement between local
and distant microglial activation the cortical projections and atrophy hippocampus lends credence
 the theory that chronically activated microglial
cells might one the effectors neurodegenerative processes thus influencing neuroinflammation
can have potential therapeutic implications these
diseases In this study have found increased
levels C R BPND across almost

Data are presented mean SD versus controls 
all predefined brain regions AD and PDD subjects compared controls consistent with previous
reports 
Growing evidence indicates that neuroinflammation contributes significantly the pathological
process chronic neurodegenerative diseases and
this could act independently and along with the
other pathological substrates neurodegenerative
diseases In AD microglial cells are activated 
amyloid deposition generating proinflammatory
response leading neuronal death The damaged
neurons and neurofibrillary tangles can turn activate microglia inducing vicious cycle neuronal
damage and reactive gliosis In PD findings
from neuropathological studies have shown that
microglial cells are associated with synucleinpositive Lewy neurites and that misfolded
 synuclein released from neurons can directly activate microglial cells In PDD according Braak and
colleagues the spread Lewy body pathology starts
from dorsal motor nucleus vagus and olfactory
nucleus then reaches substantia nigra basal forebrain and ultimately the sensory association areas
and premotor areas the neocortex Thus could
 implied that neuroinflammation triggered Lewy
body pathology follows the same temporal spatial
progression which turn could lead neuronal
damage both anterograde and retrograde fashion 
Moreover has been demonstrated that microglial
activation may lead synaptic dysfunction and loss
 dopaminergic axonal projections with retrograde
neurodegeneration In this study have
shown that microglial activation locally and the
cortical projections from hippocampus could cause
neuronal damage and hippocampal atrophy which 
novel and has never been demonstrated before 
It should also mentioned that microglial cells
 brain express different phenotypes depending 
the type proinflammatory stimuli received either
via paracrine autocrine manner The cytokine
stimulation essential for microglial polarization
into the classically activated the phenotype which activated the alternate pathway
 In AD has also been demonstrated that dysfunctional microglial response could contribute A
accumulation As AD pathology worsens there
 switch from phenotype consistent with
the idea that microglia become less responsive 
induction signals they age In our study 
 cannot discern whether glial activation detected
 C R PET might mainly due 
either the two phenotypes However microglial
activation detected C R PET associated with hippocampal volume loss and correlated
with MMSE suggesting the putative effect the
microglial cells described before 
G D Femminella Hippocampal Volume and Neuroinammation
It known that other factors can affect neuroinflammation such the activity the central
adrenergic system As example multiple lines
 evidence indicate that the adrenergic neurotransmitter norepinephrine also exerts anti inflammatory
actions within the CNS In transgenic AD mouse
models with locus coeruleus the major source
 noradrenergic projections degeneration the
decrease norepinephrine has shown induce
the inflammatory reaction microglial cells AD
and exacerbate neuroinflammation induced the
deposition amyloid 
In this study have also demonstrated that hippocampal volume AD and PDD subjects directly
correlated with reduction glucose metabolism 
voxel level This finding accordance with previous evidence which have shown that patients with
AD and PDD have extensive areas cerebral atrophy and hypometabolism comparison with control
subjects Vander Borght compared AD and PDD
subjects matched for dementia severity finding similar metabolic reductions both globally and regionally 
however PDD exhibited greater metabolic reduction the occipital cortex but relatively preserved
metabolism the medial temporal lobe compared
 AD FDG PET studies AD have indicated that
glucose metabolic deficits start from the hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex and then involve
the temporo parietal cortices In this study 
have been able demonstrate similar pattern 
hypometabolism and increase microglial activation
 those regions 
Recent data have demonstrated that PD patients
with mild cognitive impairment hypometabolism
exceeds atrophy the angular gyrus occipital orbital and anterior frontal lobes In
PDD patients the hypometabolic areas observed 
PD patients with mild cognitive impairment were
replaced areas atrophy which were surrounded
 extensive zones hypometabolism areas where
atrophy extended more than hypometabolism were
found the precentral and supplementary motor
areas both patients with mild cognitive impairment
and with PDD and the hippocampus and temporal
lobe patients with PDD 
These data are also accordance with our findings 
First all while found significant hippocampal atrophy AD subjects were not able 
detect any significant differences hippocampal volume between PDD and controls Previous reports
evaluating hippocampal volume PD and PDD
patients showed conflicting results Some authors
have reported hippocampal atrophy even early
stages the disease while others have not found
significant differences compared age matched controls Although mixed AD PD pathology can
 present our study population our PDD patients
did not show significant hippocampal atrophy compared age matched controls Our AD group also
showed occipital hypometabolism which more commonly observed PDD however this finding has
been observed works from our studies and others
 Unlike other studies our measurement 
rCMRGlc was quantitative and absolute used
the arterial input for the FDG PET scans 
We evaluated the correlation between microglial
activation the hippocampus and cortical regions
where death neuronal projections direct and indirect from the hippocampus could influence the level
 microglial activation due the death the neurons the medial temporal lobe and neocortical
regions microglial activation and neuronal death
 the hippocampus could lead microglial activation the projected neurons The hippocampal fibers
are connected directly the entorhinal cortex and
from there project perirhinal parahippocampal cortices and widely the cortex This correlation
suggests that microglial activation could cause neuronal damage the immediate vicinity well 
 distant regions connected indirectly from the hippocampus It suggested that this could due
 the loss afferent and efferent fibers from the
hippocampal neurons while cortical microglial activation independent hippocampal denervation 
also possibility This phenomenon also reported
 stroke 
Indeed our cohort hippocampal atrophy AD
group seems correlate well with neuroinflammation within the hippocampus and regions 
direct indirect cortical projections It known
that enthorinal cortex within the medial temporal lobe
 connected both via afferent and efferent neuronal
pathways hippocampus Moreover the enthorinal
cortex also connected variety cortical and
subcortical regions amygdala olfactory bulb cingulate cortex temporal cortex and the orbital cortex
 along with other frontal and parietal regions Thus 
 conceivable that neuroinflammation the hippocampus could lead neuronal dysfunction locally
and remotely connected cortical areas possibly
leading neurodegeneration and atrophy Fig 
It could also argued that microglial activation
 cortical areas hippocampal projection might
lead neuroinflammation and atrophy within the
G D Femminella Hippocampal Volume and Neuroinammation
hippocampus It likely that both these processes
might happen AD pathology leading vicious
cycle neurodegeneration Interestingly our data
set demonstrated that hippocampal volume correlated
significantly the reduction rCMRGlc and the
increase microglial activation AD wider 
terms voxel volume brain regions compared 
PDD suggesting that for comparable cognitive status the underlying microglial activation and reduction rCMRGlc spatially more widespread AD
than PDD and accordingly significant atrophy has set
 AD but not PDD Similarly have found that
the reduction hippocampal glucose metabolism 
AD associated with wider areas increased glial
activation compared PDD This could suggest that
cognitive dysfunction PDD also contributed 
other factors like presence synuclein 
The neuropsychometric assessment the study
population indicated that the AD group achieved significantly lower scores than PDD immediate and
delayed memory recall This partially accordance with previous studies that have shown that 
for comparable MMSE levels AD and PDD patients
perform differently memory attention and executive functions even early stages the disease 
 This could due the different neuropathological substrate which AD affects primarily the
medial temporal cortex and the neocortical association areas while PD neurodegeneration starts
 the brain stem and subsequently spreads the
cortical areas In the present study have also
found significant negative correlations between cognitive profile measured MMSE scores versus
 C R BPND and positive correlation
between MMSE score versus hippocampal volume 
and MMSE scores versus rCMRGlc further suggesting the putative effect microglial activation late
stage the disease 
The findings this study are limited the small
number subjects per group and the crosssectional design however this proof principle
study sheds more light into the role neuroinflammation and how this influences the neurodegenerative process Also the use multiple comparisons
might increase the risk false positive inferences
 type I error have reduced this error applying
correction for multiple comparisons our regression analysis C R PET though used
for many years selective marker microglial
activation via binding the upregulated TPSO
protein shows vivo binding orders magnitude lower than second generation TPSO tracers like
 C It has been shown that the rate clearance C R considerably faster than
many other widely used PET radioligands leading 
 very low ratio specific non specific binding It
 also suggested that the fraction non specifically
bound C R the grey matter about
 However reproducibility studies with C R have shown that the tracer binding large
brain regions was acceptable for applied clinical studies Future studies with second generation TSPO
markers may able extend these results further 
other neurodegenerative diseases However secondgeneration tracers are influenced the TSPO polymorphism Moreover although C R 
generally considered specific marker for activated microglial cells several studies have suggested
that this tracer also binds reactive astrocytes 
brain Another limitation the present
study that the observed correlations between hippocampal volume and C R BPND the
ROI level were not evident when the groups were
analyzed separately Although cannot exclude
that this just simply attributable differences
between groups there was significant difference
between microglial activation between these two
groups However were only able evaluate small
numbers subjects enrolment larger number
 subjects was limited the intensity scanning
involved this study Previous reports from our
group have shown that correlation exists between
MMSE scores and cortical microglial activation 
voxel level using SPM analysis both AD subjects
and PDD subjects separately 
In conclusion have shown that glial activation within the hippocampus assessed 
 C R PET inversely correlates with hippocampal volume neurodegenerative diseases with
dementia These findings provide further evidence
for the central role microglial activation 
neurodegenerative pathologies like AD and PDD 
and highlights microglial activation potential
therapeutic target combating chronic neuroinflammation and resultant neurodegeneration
