From February May total 
consecutive PD inpatients were examined the Parkinson Disease Unit IRCCS San Camillo Hospital 
 Venice Italy All patients underwent extensive clinical neuropsychological behavioral and MRI evaluations The patients inclusion criteria were diagnosis
 idiopathic PD according the UK Brain Bank criteria ability understand study purposes and
procedures and willingness participate the
study To maximize subjective feedback from selfreported questionnaires and take into account cognitive and psychological aspect that might influence
pain Mini Mental State Examination score
 MMSE and Beck Depression Index II score

To comprehensively evaluate the pain the PD and
healthy participants used the following tools 
the KPP scale Visual Analogue Scale VAS 
and Leeds Assessment Neuropathic Symptoms and
Signs LANSS The KPP scale validated comprehensive questionnaire and was chosen for its ability 
discriminate different types pain and evaluate its
intensity and daily frequency The scale has domains investigating musculoskeletal chronic visceral 
nocturnal motor fluctuationrelated radicular and
oro facial pain during the last month One more
items address every domain Higher scores are associated with more frequent more intense pain The
LANSS scale was developed discriminate whether
pain had predominantly neuropathic features and 
includes items investigating different symptoms such
 burning pain electroshock like pain pins and needles sensations and hyperalgesia Scores can range
from and score higher indicates
that pain likely have neuropathic origin

Discussion
We investigated functional and structural brain correlates persistent pain PD using both exhaustive clinical evaluation and neuroimaging techniques 
This the first report linking comprehensive clinical
assessment persistent pain with anatomical and
functional neuroimaging 
Our data indicate that persistent pain PD associated with relative thinning several brain areas
DLPFC Orbito Frontal Cortex OFC posterior Insular Cortex pIC and PCCand with local functional
alterations the OFC and cerebellum Most structural alterations the DLPFC OFC and pIC have been
reported other chronic pain conditions 
DLPFC part the mesocortical system and
receives dopamine projections from both the SN pars
compacta and the ventral tegmental area VTA It
 key area the descending pain modulatory system consistent with its role expectation reward 
and decision making The OFC also well connected with the striatum and dopaminergic nuclei and
 involved expectation and rewards The OFC
increases its activity link several stimuli with their
subjective emotional and affective during
pain inhibition Posterior IC considered central
area for sensory integration receiving significant inputs from nociceptive and nonnociceptive fibers It
forms the main sensory area for inputs from the spinothalamic pathway pIC also highly connected with
primary and secondary sensory areas the parietal
lobe that are important during sensory discriminative
processing inputs including nociception Insular
Cortex IC considered central area for nonmotor

receives modulatory inputs the hippocampus and
VTA NAc has recently emerged key structure
 chronic and neuropathic pain Both animal and
human studies pointed out its role the transition
from subacute chronic and neuropathic pain In
our study patients the PD Pain group had both
chronic pain and neuropathic features and the alteration reward feedback because reduced NAc tohippocampus interaction consistent with the clinical
presentation 
Other functional MRI studies used fALFF present
local alterations the OFC temporal areas and cerebellar circuits PD Pain patients Our data demonstrate that OFC covers major role PD pain 
showing both structural and functional alterations 
The cerebellum receives projection from the basal ganglia and VTA and sends projections widespread
network including the frontal DLPFC motor 
somatosensory and parietal regions Emerging evidence indicates that the cerebellum PD presents specific structural changes and may related 
nonmotor manifestations Our results are also consistent with evidence demonstrating the functional
alteration the right cerebellum and parietal regions

Our clinical assessments were comprehensive and
PD groups with and without pain were well comparable demographic cognitive psychological and
motor aspects except for total LEDD which was
modestly lower the PD Pain patients possibly
because the greater prevalence women Clinical
results are consistent with other neuroimaging evaluations We found differences WM the subcortical regions typically related PDs motor and
cognitive impairment We are confident the presented results express persistent pain and lingual and

 related additional nonmotor features which may
 addressed future studies Of note fMRI highly variable within subjects and may change under
different conditions ON and OFF phases We
carefully assessed all patients the ON state

large but the prevalence patients with persistent
pain without any previous peripheral cause that satisfied our criteria was relatively small Indeed our
cohort was identified after screening patients and
the participants were carefully evaluated before inclusion Our data showed strong correlations across the
domains KPP suggesting that common mechanisms
may responsible for the persistence various pain

confirming other published data that have showed 
high prevalence and variability pain PD 
In conclusion highlighted for the first time network brain regional alterations specifically associated persistent pain PD and not present painfree patients with similar cognitive psychological and
clinical profiles We propose that the present network
 involved pain processing regardless its primary
manifestation Pain PD associated with distinct
regional alterations dopaminergic areas such the
OFCwhich presents both functional and structural
changesand PFC Other nondopaminergic areas
such the pIC PCC parietal regions and cerebellum
also showed structural and functional changes that
might related sensory motor and emotional
responses pain 
Further longitudinal studies are needed improve
our understanding the supraspinal mechanisms 
pain PD Our data strongly recommend that future
research considers and controls for pain symptoms 
they are associated with important structural and
functional cerebral changes
