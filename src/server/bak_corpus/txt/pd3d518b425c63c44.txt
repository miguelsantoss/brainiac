Abstract Patients with Parkinsons disease PD may present
impairment cognitive functions even early stages the
disease When compared with the general population their
risk dementia six times higher Recent investigations using structural MRI have shown that dementia PD 
related cortical structural changes and that specic cognitive dysfunctions can attributed atrophy specic structures We review the structural MRI studies carried out PD
using either manual region interest ROI approach 
voxel based morphometry VBM ROI studies have shown
that hippocampal volume decreased patients with PD
with and without dementia addition hippocampal atrophy
correlated with decits verbal memory VBM studies have
demonstrated that dementia PD involves structural changes
 limbic areas and widespread cortical atrophy Findings 
nondemented patients with PD are less conclusive possibly
because cognitively heterogeneous groups patients have
been studied Patients with PD with cognitive impairment
and visual hallucinations present greater brain atrophy than
patients without these characteristics These ndings suggest
that cortical atrophy related cognitive dysfunction PD
and precedes the development dementia Structural MRI
might therefore provide early marker for dementia

Key words Parkinsons disease dementia hallucinations 
MRI cognitive functions
Parkinsons disease PD has traditionally been considered motor disorder However cognitive dysfunctions are known occur even early and
most patients develop dementia over the course the
disease Dementia PD was initially described 
subcortical and cognitive dysfunctions nondemented
patients have been attributed dopaminergic depletion
affecting the fronto striatal the dopamine acetylcholine synaptic imbalance Nevertheless recent
investigations using MRI suggest that specic cogni 
tive decits such memory decits and dementia 
PD may also explained cortical structural
changes The methods most widely used assess
structural MRI changes PD have been region interest ROI and voxel based morphometry VBM 
The ROI method consists measuring manually
delineated and anatomically dened regions within the
brain based priori hypothesis ROI approach
takes into consideration the variability across subjects 
but also depends the subjective criteria the
investigator time consuming inter and intrarater validations are mandatory VBM fully automated
whole brain measurement technique that maps the statistical probability differences regional tissue volume density between groups It provides nonbiased measure regions that may neglected 
hypothesis based studies using ROI However the normalization stage within the VBM analysis which 
required ensure that the same brain regions can

compared between subjects transforms the shape 
the brain image and may distort the abnormal tissue
and articially inate the atrophied areas Other structural techniques that have proved successful detecting atrophy are surface based and D modeling analyses but they have not been used date PD 
In this study review structural MRI ndings
using manual ROI and VBM patients with PD with
dementia patients with PD without dementia and nondemented patients with PD with neuropsychological
impairment and hallucinations who are therefore 
risk developing dementia 
MRI STUDIES IN PATIENTS WITH PD WITH
DEMENTIA
Manual ROI studies patients with PD have mainly
focused medial temporal lobe structures because
these areas are known present atrophy other
dementias such Alzheimers disease AD and dementia with Lewy bodies DLB and because differences the degree atrophy between dementias may
have important implications for diagnosis Atrophy
 the and has been
reported PD with dementia remaining statistically
signicant after controlling for global cerebral volume 
In addition reduced entorhinal cortex volume has been
reported patients with PD with dementia when compared with controls Medial temporal lobe atrophy 
encountered AD but studies PD with dementia
show that atrophy medial temporal lobe areas may
also underlie dementia PD 
In previous study using VBM observed that
patients with PD with dementia showed gray matter
loss hippocampus parahippocampus and anterior
cingulate gyrus well the basal ganglia comparison with healthy controls Interestingly the and cingulate are known 
major targets for Lewy body LB inclusions PD 
Another VBM study with large number patients
provided further evidence medial temporal and basal
ganglia atrophy but also reported greater widespread
neocortical atrophy In that study atrophy the
medial temporal lobe structures was more pronounced
 AD than demented PD and there were differences between DLB and PD with dementia However 
another group has recently reported that patients with
DLB showed greater neocortical atrophy than patients
with PD with dementia the temporal parietal and
occipital lobes 
The degree atrophy demented patients with PD
may vary depending the time the occurrence 
dementia the course the disease early 
late Early development dementia has been associated with more severe degeneration cortical and
subcortical structures and neuroimaging studies Overall neuroimaging studies are 
agreement with ndings postmortem neuropathological studies demented PD which report morphological changes and neocortical 
and have the advantage assessing these changes 
vivo The fact that changes medial temporal lobe
areas are common dementia PD and other neurodegenerative diseases such AD and DLB raises
the question whether AD cortical LB type
changes underlie cognitive dysfunctions 
unfortunately the structural MRI neuroimaging techniques reviewed this work are still some way from
resolving this matter 
MRI STUDIES IN PATIENTS WITH PD
WITHOUT DEMENTIA
The rst study using manual ROI 
assess the hippocampus nondemented patients with
PD reported decreased hippocampal volume patients
with PD without dementia when compared with controls However these results should viewed with
caution because some patients may have met criteria
for mild cognitive impairment MCI but was not
detected Another looked for differences 
several structures including the hippocampus parahippocampus temporal lobe frontal lobe and parietooccipital areas nding that only corrected hippocampal
volumes differed nondemented patients with PD and
controls P even though the effect size for
nondemented patients with PD was only when
compared with effect sizes and for
demented PD and AD groups respectively It has also
been reported that nondemented patients with PD presented volume reductions the amygdala and
 the hippocampus when compared with controls volumes both structures nondemented
patients with PD had values between those 
demented patients and controls although the differences did not reach statistical signicance In addition 
signicant age associated hippocampal atrophy PD
was found one study which hippocampal volumes
 old nondemented patients differed from controls but not younger cases 
Studies using visual evaluation PD 
 which score zero represented absence atrophy and score four high severity reported that
early stage nonmedicated patients with PD had atrophy

 the bilateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus The
right hippocampus atrophy score was PD versus controls and the left hippocampus score
was PD versus controls Another
study from the same sample nondemented patients with PD but more advanced stage
 the disease and with impairment several cognitive
domains also reported atrophy the hippocampus and
the prefrontal cortex when compared with controls 
Rated visually more severe medial temporal atrophy
has also been reported patients with PD versus controls but less than subjects with DLB and AD 
Results VBM studies patients with PD without
dementia are heterogeneous but most ndings suggest
the involvement neocortical areas In these patients 
atrophy has been reported caudate nucleus frontal
areas and insula prefrontal cortex and parahippocampus hippocampus and anterior cingulate left intraparietal sulcus superior temporal and frontal
gyrus and cerebellum A possible explanation
for this high variability might the heterogeneous
characteristics patients with PD who are often considered one uniform group without differentiating
between cognitively intact patients and those with neuropsychological decits with hallucinations

HALLUCINATIONS
Cognitive impairment common even newly diagnosed patients with PD occurring 
cases Patients with cognitive decits have increased
risk developing dementia One study found that
patients with PD with MCI diagnosis according the
criteria proposed Petersen had gray matter
reductions temporal and frontal areas when compared
with patients without MCI Another imaging study that
identied MCI subtypes before conversion various
kinds dementia found that the subtype most closely
associated with conversion dementia PD was characterized third ventricular enlargement and similar 
though less severe atrophy the medial temporal lobe
when compared with patients with MCI who converted
 AD Corrected hippocampal volumes patients with
MCI converting AD were left and

tia PD and similar efforts should made create
standardized criteria for MCI diagnosis this condition 
Patients with visual hallucinations VHs present
greater neuropsychological impairment domains such
 verbal memory language semantic uency and
visuoperceptive functions than those without Longitudinal studies have pointed out the presence VH 
 predictor dementia PD We found that nondemented patients with PD with VH had gray matter
loss occipito parietal regions when compared with
patients without and also presented hippocampal
atrophy when compared with healthy controls These
results suggest that pathological changes occurring 
PD with VH are more marked and severe than those
occurring nonhallucinating patients with PD As 
AD hippocampal atrophy mainly affected the head 
the structure and correlated with verbal memory 
Smaller hippocampal volumes and specically the
involvement the hippocampal head have been identied predictors conversion dementia AD The
same may apply PD this initially nondemented
sample patients with PD with VH nearly half met the
criteria for dementia after year follow 
Manual ROI studies also provide evidence that specic cognitive decits are related specic structural
changes PD Hippocampus volumes have been
reported correlate with memory and
overall cognitive performance scores but not with
frontal functions In addition amygdalar volumes
have been reported correlate with scores these
cognitive tests The atrophy medial temporal
structures probably runs parallel and may underlie
the memory dysfunctions associated with PD 
LONGITUDINAL MRI STUDIES IN PATIENTS
WITH PD
The progression regional brain atrophy with
VBM PD has only been investigated two studies The rst study showed limbic and temporooccipital areas gray matter reduction after month follow but the other study found areas
 gray matter loss patients with PD after followup period years The differences these
results may explained longer disease duration 
increased age patients more prolonged follow 
and use uncorrected P values the study which
atrophy was documented In agreement with the rst
study earlier report Hu found that annual
brain volume loss was greater patients with PD than
 controls and these changes correlated with cognitive
decline However other serial MRI studies using meas 
MRI AND COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT IN PD
ures global atrophy for monitoring disease progression reported differences atrophy rates between
controls and nondemented patients with PD but
found signicantly increased atrophy patients with
PD with dementia when compared with nondemented
patients with PD and controls 
Longitudinal MRI studies should focus tracking
regional cortical changes PD Neuropathological
studies PD have proposed six stage 
brain pathology indicate predictable sequence 
ascending lesions that correlates with neurological decits the majority patients with early onset and
long duration the disease but this classication often fails correlate with clinical severity and dementia PD MRI studies permit assessment morphological changes vivo allowing establish where
morphological changes begin and for which kind 
patients these changes become more marked and which
ones remain stable over time Furthermore the areas
that suffer the most atrophy over time are related 
cognitive dysfunctions that lead dementia would
 able determine objective markers for the development dementia and provide evidence therapeutic
effect when modifying treatments related the onset
 dementia are available 
CONCLUSIONS
MRI studies have reported cortical atrophy PD 
ROI imaging studies have shown reduced hippocampal
and amygdala volumes even nondemented patients 
and atrophy these structures has been related 
overall cognitive performance and memory decits 
PD VBM studies have demonstrated that patients with
PD with dementia present limbic and widespread neocortical gray matter loss whereas patients with PD
without dementia mainly present atrophy frontal and
temporal areas Nondemented patients with PD with 
higher risk developing dementia for example those
with cognitive impairment and VHs show greater
atrophy than patients who not present these risk factors The involvement the hippocampus patients
with PD with cognitive decits has been identied 
both ROI and VBM studies Evidence neocortical
involvement currently available only from whole
brain VBM studies because date ROI studies
have focused the relationship between specic neocortical regions and cognitive domains Overall these
ndings suggest that cortical atrophy related cognitive dysfunction PD and precedes the development
 dementia Cortical atrophy assessed MRI may
therefore useful early marker for the development
 dementia PD The imaging ndings reviewed
here suggest that the term subcortical dementia 
not adequate describe the dementia occurring PD 
However should borne mind that the results
from MRI structural studies PD vary widely The
main problems are follows the heterogeneity 
samples studied not always well dened whether
the patients with PD included present cognitive decits
and psychiatric symptoms and fact the criteria
used diagnose dementia vary from study study 
 the inconsistency applying correction for global
cerebral volume whole brain VBM and ROI studies 
and the inconsistency the protocol used VBM 
optimized versus classical protocols use modulated
versus unmodulated images and the size the Gaussian kernel the smoothing 
To overcome these difculties make the following recommendations cognitive and psychiatric
symptoms the sample should dened using the
criteria proposed the Movement Disorder Task
Force for the diagnosis dementia PD both
raw and corrected volumes the selected structures
should reported ROI studies the standard
 for reporting VBM studies should followed and modulation gray matter volume should
 used based the warping applied during normalization minimize the danger distortion We
also favor the use the recently developed Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra DARTEL algorithm nonlinear
warping technique minimize structural variation
between subjects 
Major challenges that remain the eld MRI
structural studies PD are the need establish patterns
 atrophy that can predict different disease outcomes
and combine their use with other approaches such 
PET studies using different tracers FDG MPPF and
FDDNP determine the etiopathogenesis PD
