Results Compared with healthy controls patients with
PDD showed gray matter volume decreases several the
following regions bilateral putamen accumbens nuclei left
side the thalamus bilateral hippocampus parahippocampal region and anterior cingulate gyrus Patients with PD
also showed gray matter reductions compared with healthy
controls the right side the hippocampus left anterior
cingulate gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus 
Conclusions The hippocampus thalamus and anterior
cingulate are the regions most affected PDD Our results agree with recent neuropathological findings suggesting the involvement the limbic and cortical areas PD

ARKINSON DISEASE PD IS
among the most frequent
chronic neurodegenerative
diseases The estimated
prevalence PD with dementia PDD approximately and the risk
 dementia patients with PD almost 
times higher than the general elderly
population 
The neuropathological basis responsible for the presence PDD remains
controversial Degeneration the subcortical structures notably the medial
part the substantia the basal
ganglia amygdala and thalamus 
nucleus basalis and locus
 have variously been implicated PDD However recent studies
also emphasize the importance cortical changes An association has been
observed between dementia and the
presence cortical Lewy bodies The
presence Alzheimer type neuropathology PD another likely contributor

Magnetic resonance imaging MRI allows vivo identification global and

DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND SELECTION
Idiopathic PD was diagnosed using the criteria the Parkinsons Disease Society Brain Bank London England All
patients had good excellent initial response 
levodopa treatment Dementia was assessed using standardized instruments the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Mental Disorders Fourth Edition DSM IV the Clinical Dementia Rating scale and the Mini Mental State Examination 
Subjects needed Clinical Dementia Rating scale score 
Mini Mental State Examination score less than and both
DSM IV items fulfill dementia criteria The Clinical Dementia Rating scale and DSM IV were administered trained
clinician J M Francesc Valldeoriola MD and the MiniMental State Examination experienced neuropsychologist C S Where required for the Clinical Dementia Rating
scale collateral information was drawn from the patients
spouse caregiver The control group was matched for sex
and age SD years the patient with PDD Three
patients were excluded owing MRI movement artifacts 
Patients were clinically assessed using the Unified Parkinsons
Disease Rating Scale 
MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained all subjects using T scanner GE Medical Systems Co Milwaukee Wis 
and the head coil A strict imaging protocol was used including dimensional inversion recovery preparation spoiled gradient recalled echo sequence the entire brain the axial plane 
and the following parameters repetition time milliseconds echo time milliseconds inversion time milliseconds section thickness field view 
and number excitations

VOXEL BASED MORPHOMETRY
The MRIs were analyzed using WDCN London http 
 www fil ion ucl spm All the automated image processing was done single masked investigator C S One
subject with PD was excluded from VBM analysis because visual inspection the MRI revealed marked hypointensities consistent with basal ganglia calcifications 
All MRI processing was carried out accord with the optimized VBM protocol Briefly the processing steps outlined
 this protocol are the creation customized anatomical
 weighted template and prior probability images separately for
each group normalizing the brain images the default SPM
 weighted template segmenting averaging and smoothing
the averaged brains each group normalization the structural brain images each group using these customized templates segmenting and cleaning the original weighted images normalizing the brain images the customized templates 
segmentation and cleaning normalized brain images and modulation gray matter images the determinant the Jacobian
matrix derived from the spatial normalization step This procedure has been previously described detail 
Differences gray matter were examined using analysis 
variance with post hoc comparisons controlspatients with

 determine which voxel differences were specific one disease process Results were thresholded for the group being
studied P uncorrected for multiple comparisons 
Only those clusters exceeding size voxels were
included the analysis 
Owing the characteristics our acquisition protocol and
head size differences among subjects the most superior and 
inferior regions were absent some subjects not clearly visible after reorientation Therefore restricted the volumetric analysis region interest comprising the temporal lobes

Hippocampal atrophy has been consistently described
 feature dementia In our study VBM results showed
 bilateral hippocampal reduction patients with PDD 
which was more pronounced the right hemisphere Previous studies have observed hippocampal degeneration 
PD Hippocampal reductions may due both Lewy
body and Alzheimer type changes 
We also found relationship between reduction the
left side the thalamus and dementia The thalamus has
also recently been identified major target for neuropathological inclusions such Lewy bodies patients with PD and earlier study neuropathology
and dementia PD also identified volumetric loss the
thalamus predictor dementia Because our study 
the patients with PDD had greater motor impairment than
patients with PD possible that tissue loss observed
 the thalamus and putamen may reflect motor well
 cognitive impairment PDD 
Analysis cortical regions with VBM showed marked
volume decrease the anterior cingulate patients with
PDD compared with controls The anterior cingulate has
been shown particularly vulnerable Lewy body
inclusions and DLB Volumetric reduction
 the anterior cingulate may involved the attentional deficits described PDD 
We also found extensive volumetric reduction the
parahippocampal gyrus In DLB cases with wellformed visual hallucinations exhibited high densities 
Lewy bodies the amygdala and parahippocampus Several subjects with dementia our sample had history
 visual hallucinations 
Patients with PD but without dementia also differed
from controls the hippocampus and anterior cingulate although reductions were less marked than for patients with PDD Further the comparison between patients with PDD and patients with PD revealed differences
 the right side the hippocampus and the left superior temporal regions Together these results suggest that
there may gradient neuropathology affecting cingulate and medial temporal lobe structures parkinsonism Consistent with this idea postmortem studies
have demonstrated that all patients with PD have some
degree cortical Lewy body pathology 
Our study has the limitations implicit VBM procedures One should cautious when using automated image processing packages for investigations degenerative diseases because the software was not specifically
designed measure atrophy We attempted solve
this problem creating local template comprising both
patients with PDD patients with PD and controls Also 
our sample was exclusive patients from clinical population and may not representative patients with PD
and patients with PDD the wider community We also
used criteria for enrollment the PDD group that excluded patients with questionable early onset dementia and that focused memory impairment rather than
visuospatial attentional deficits Our results may thus 
pertain more patients the more advanced stages 
dementia and further studies with patients exhibiting 
spectrum dementia severity may required establish whether MRI useful technique for differential diagnosis PDD 
 REPRINTED ARCH NEUROL VOL FEB 
CONCLUSIONS
Voxel based morphometric methods were used examine structural brain changes PDD gray matter loss
 both cortical and subcortical sites was observed Results revealed volumetric reductions thalamic hippocampal and anterior cingulate regions corroborating previous neuropathological findings PDD
