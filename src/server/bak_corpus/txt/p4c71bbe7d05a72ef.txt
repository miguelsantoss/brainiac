treatments such physical activity have recently been investigated 
PD Such new approach based increasing number studies 
animals and humans which indicate that physical exercise may attenuate symptoms the disease and even exert neuroprotective effect
 Hirsch and Farley In rodents for example mice model PD
forced exercise treadmill did not develop behavioural decits
and signicantly preserved nigrostriatal neuronal connections well
 striatal dopamine levels compared sedentary mice Pothakos 
 Yoon Petzinger have also found
that similar exercise intervention improves efciency brain dopamine cells more mice who exercised compared those that did
not Altogether these results suggest that exercise improves dopaminergic neurotransmission efciency modifying the areas the
brain the substantia nigra and basal ganglia where dopamine signals originate Petzinger Given that movement modulated through dopamine ndings rodents suggest possible interaction
between behaviour and neuronal cerebral viability the striatum after
cardiovascular exercise Petzinger 
In humans studies PD individuals have demonstrated signicant
improvement gait and mobility following supervised physical exercise Beall Herman Nadeau Ridgel
 van Eijkeren Among the many different
types physical training programs resistance training exibility 
coordination etc aerobic exercise training AET has been the most
studied far and the one that has shown the most unequivocal benets health across the life span Voss Although the underlying mechanisms PD still remain conjectural has been
hypothesized that exercise dependent plasticity following AET acts 
the brain similar manner the dopaminergic derived treatments 
using the same pathways produce symptomatic relief Beall 
 It thus possible that exercise dependent change can have benecial effects motor skill learning processes More specically AET
may restore motor sequence learning MSL capacity that frequently impaired PD Clark improving brain functioning the
level the striatum motor related associated circuits 
Despite behavioural impairment observed when performing MSL
tasks studies have demonstrated that similar motor related brain regions seem recruited individuals with PD Carbon 
Schendan Werheid healthy aging controls
 Albouy Doyon Specically functional brain
imaging studies with healthy participants have shown that brain plasticity associated with MSL relies recruitment striatum and hippocampus well the cerebellum motor cortical regions and
prefrontal and parietal cortex Albouy Doyon 
Studies with PD individuals yielded similar regions but different patterns interaction between them the cortico striatal and mediotemporal lobe networks Carbon Schendan 
Werheid Furthermore these ndings could inuenced
 the disease stage and the impact dopaminergic medication see
Ruitenberg for review However studies directly comparing the neuronal substrate involved MSL healthy and PD are few
and those directly comparing the effects aerobic exercise the
MSL neuronal substrate healthy and PD are non existent In fact 
one study demonstrated that single bout high intensity aerobic exercise facilitates motor sequence learning healthy individuals Mang
 but the neural correlates these effects have never been
investigated the whole brain level and furthermore they have
never been specic the chronic effects exercise 
Thus date there lack evidence regarding the effects aerobic training exercise the MSL functional neuronal substrate both
healthy and PD In response this knowledge gap the principal aim 
the present study was investigate with whole brain functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI the neural substrate mediating the effects cardiorespiratory exercise MSL both PD and healthy
control HC individuals We have already presented behavioural evidence that month AET improved MSL capacity both healthy and
PD individuals well executive functions PD Duchesne 
 In the current article present the neuroimaging data related
 MSL from the same study and hypothesize that AET will improve MSL capacity through augmented activity the cortico striatal
 CS system PD and MSL related cerebral activity changes observed after AET will linked improvement aerobic tness

Methods
 Participants
Forty two participants PD patients and HC were eligible for
participation after the completion the rst evaluation However between the evaluation and prior the onset the exercise regimen 
two HC participants decided withdraw from the project for personal
reasons One PD participant and one HC were excluded after the beginning for health security One PD patient was excluded from analysis because extreme results several outcomes even this person
respected all inclusion criteria PD patients had classied stage
 according Hoehn and Yahrs scale Hoehn and Yahr 
based upon evaluation certied neurologist Participants who
were under medication continued their treatment all throughout the
study testing and training A total participants women 
aged between and years old participated the present study 
 were diagnosed with PD and were healthy control HC subjects 
They were screened for appropriateness for testing MR environment metallic implants that could interfere with testing 
claustrophobia etc Then the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire PAR Q Warburton was used verify the
participants safety participating physical program To control
for pre existing experience tasks requiring highly coordinated nger
dexterities PD and HC subjects had have previous training 
playing musical instrument nor any training professional typist 
Other exclusion criteria included the presence other neurological disorders comorbidities likely affect gait any history smoking 
heart diseases and high baseline physical activity 
These two groups were well matched with respect their sex distribution age number years education and tness level there
were signicant differences any these variables prior the
AET intervention program see Table Yet and expected signicant

 Behavioural statistical data analysis
First PD subjects were recruited based neurological assessment
performed expert neurologist Clinical assessments the participants health and physical activity level were then performed 
geriatrist neuropsychologist and physiologist using the following
tests the United Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale UPDRS Goetz 
 the Montreal Cognitive Assessment MOCA Mini Mental

 Jackson 
Participants cardiovascular tness level was evaluated using either 
submaximal aerobic test HC PD medically supervised maximal oxygen uptake test HC PD The protocol required minutes resting period before measuring heart rate blood pressure and
aerobic capacity For the evaluated with sub maximal test using recumbent bike the test started with workload stage W for
women and men respectively lasting one minute the intensity increasing progressively W every minute until they reached 
 their predicted maximal heart rate HRmax age 
When the target heart rate was reached participants were asked 
complete the current stage possible The power level W the
last completed stage was used extrapolate the maximal aerobic
power MAP Then max estimation was calculated with body
weight and MAP W measures using the American College
Sport Medicines formula W weight MAP estimation was used for exercise prescription For the participants that were
evaluated with graded cycling one minute workload stage maximal
test the protocol started again W W for women and men 
respectively and the intensity progressively increased W every
minute until maximal efforts criteria were fullled age predicted
maximal heart rate bpm and VO plateau until subjects
could not maintain the required workload anymore fatigue Aerobic
capacity max was measured directly using breath breath
system The last completed stage power W was recorded and
used for exercise prescription American College Sport Medicine 
 Importantly PD individuals performed the stress test while
following their usual medication regimen which did not change
during the study period In addition for each patient the stress
tests were administered the same time day and did not change

Functional volumes were pre processed and analysed using 
 http www ion ucl spm software Wellcome Department Imaging Neuroscience London UK implemented MATLAB 
Functional scans each session were realigned using rigid body transformations iteratively optimized minimize the residual sum squares
between the rst and each subsequent image separately for each session 
hence creating mean realigned image The mean functional image was
then coregistered the structural image using rigid body transformation optimized maximize the normalized mutual information between the two images Coregistration parameters were then applied 
the realigned BOLD time series An average subject based template was
created using DARTEL and registered MNI space Montreal
Neurological Institute http www bic mni mcgill All functional and
anatomical images were then normalized using the resulting template Finally all functional images were spatially smoothed using isotropic full width half maximum FWHM Gaussian kernel 
The analysis fMRI data based summary statistics approach 
was conducted serial steps accounting respectively for xed and
random effects For each subject changes brain regional responses
were estimated through model including responses the sequence

 Aerobic exercise training
The months aerobic training regimen yielded signicant improvement aerobic tness indicated the estimated max

both HC and PD 
groups separately see Supplemental materials for more details Also
the estimated power level increased signicantly following AET the
two groups combined well the HC

separately However there was signicant group session interaction nor any group differences for all these tness measures Altogether these results indicate that the effect exercise had similar

increased their individual level aerobic tness Duchesne 
 Motor sequence learning
The detailed results the MSL task for the two conditions sequence

conditions regardless time testing pre post AET was not
signicant across all participants observed
 signicant difference reaction time between conditions 
 with performance during the sequence being faster
than during the random condition indicator motor sequence
learning capacity In addition there was marginally signicant interaction between condition and session across
the two groups hence demonstrating trend that the participants
motor sequence learning capacity tended improve more than their
performance the random condition following AET 
Within group analyses revealed between session improvement 
reaction time for both sequence and random
conditions whereas PD individuals showed
AET related improvement RT only for the sequential condition
 Most importantly when assessing motor sequence learning capacity each group identied signicant sequence learning effect sequential random conditions pre AET
 HC but not PD 
 After AET however both groups showed signicant sequence

Discussion
We recently reported that weeks progressive intense AET resulted signicant improvement aerobic tness well motor
skill learning both PD and HC groups Duchesne AET related MSL improvements were global HC individuals they were observed both conditions sequence and random but were specic 
the sequence condition PD patients In addition PD patients improved their sequence specic motor learning capacity after aerobic
training indicated the signicant difference between sequence
and random conditions after the training period only Interestingly 
the present study the neuroimaging results corroborate those behavioural ndings and suggest that AET related changes motor sequence
learning capacity difference between sequence and random conditions are mainly seen PD individuals Specically increases MSLspecic brain activity due training were found the temporal lobe

there was also positive relation between the patients change aerobic tness and MSL related changes the hippocampal and striatal activity while found negative relation between the change tness
level and activity the cerebellum PD patients Most importantly 
the effects the cerebral level are larger the PD than the HC group 
 MSL exercise dependent plasticity related the striatum and hippocampus PD individuals
The current study the rst examine the changes neural substrate supporting MSL following aerobic exercise training both
healthy controls and PD patients Our ndings thus extend the neuroimaging literature implicit MSL PD individuals and HC participants
 Gamble Ruitenberg Siegert specically highlighting the positive effects AET the MSL related activity the striatum cerebellum and all structures that are typically
involved motor learning Albouy Doyon 
 In fact our hypothesis regarding changes MSL specic 
striatal changes following AET was conrmed PD individuals This
nding consistent with previous studies which have revealed AETdependent neuroplasticity the central nervous system due neurochemical changes the striatum the latter having been proposed 
one possible mechanism action explain the gains performance
 motor tasks PD Petzinger Indeed 
research animal models PD using dopaminergic neurotoxins has
shown that behavioural motor ameliorations following physical exercise are associated with increased efciency dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission Fisher Paillard 
Petzinger which together are thought reduce
the cortically driven hyper excitability observed PD patients These
authors have reported increase dopamine availability coupled
with greater expression dopamine receptors hence producing
 better dopaminergic signaling the striatum overall Furthermore 
physical exercise has been found diminish the amount synaptic
glutamate release which known decrease the level cortical excitability Fisher Although conjectural thus probable that
the AET specic changes striatal activity observed the current
study may reect this type neurochemical mechanism which
would turn explain the improvement motor learning 
Interestingly our results revealed that AET related and MSL specic
functional brain changes are not only observed the striatum but
within the hippocampus and cerebellum well These ndings could
suggest that such brain structures are part the functional network
compensating for the typical dysfunction within the cortico striatal circuits seen PD In fact the reported positive relationship between
changes aerobic tness and AET related MSL brain changes the
same macro structures hippocampus and striatum consistent with
emerging data suggesting that links between the hippocampus and
the dopaminergic systems PD are important memory and learning
C Duchesne NeuroImage Clinical 
 Calabresi In their review Calabresi suggested
that while dopamine dependent impairment involving complex molecular dysfunction glutamatergic synapses hippocampal longterm potentiation LTP might contribute cognitive impairments 
PD such interactions could also potential source symptoms reduction PD patients Clinical interventions such AET for example 
could potentially stimulate neurogenesis the dysfunctional hippocampus PDs individuals has been shown rodents studies
 Voss Vivar Kramer and van Praag This type interventions
could also responsible for the associated involvement neurotrophic factors greater expression brain derived neurotrophic factor
 BDNF and LTP mechanisms following exercise has also been proposed
 putative mechanism responsible for the neuroprotective effects and
functional improvements this clinical population Audiffren Andr 
and Albinet Dishman Fabel and Kempermann 
 Gomez Pinilla Zhuang Feng Ying and Fan Mustroph 
 Voss Vivar Kramer and van Praag Based evidence
that exercise dependent brain changes within the hippocampus have
been associated with functional changes memory Erickson 
 Szabo can thus conjecture that the improvement
observed during MSL PD following AET could explained LTPlike processes due greater expression BDNF the hippocampus 
In light these recent ndings Calabresi can hypothesized that the benecial effect that AET has MSL related activity both these regions may based the interaction 
functional connectivity between them It possible that plastic AETand MSL related changes may rst occur within the hippocampus and
then propagate basal ganglia via interactions between the MTL and
dopaminergic system This assumption based the fact that while
MSL related changes were observed both hippocampus and striatum
 PD individuals only the hippocampus found regions which
MSL related changes activity remained positively correlated with improvements aerobic tness when PD and HC participants were compared Yet further functional connectivity investigations are still
necessary elucidate such AET related brain reorganisation 
indicating restoration functionality the network typically seen
 MSL 
According the motor sequence learning literature both the cerebellum and striatum are known involved the early MSL phase 
while only the striatum has been shown maintain its activity 
later learning stages when the memory trace has been consolidated
 Doyon Therefore while modest improvements aerobic capacity linked with increases cerebellar activity
may reect learning the early stage tested here the fact that large improvements aerobic tness were associated with enhanced hippocampal and striatal functioning may reect transition towards more
durable stage MSL These MSL ndings are thus line with previous
structural and physiological investigations which parallel the functional
changes that aerobic exercise can exert general Hillman

 MSL and exercise HC individuals
Compared PD individuals AET did not have statistically signicant effect changes the neural correlates MSL the HC group 
Such divergence between the HC and PD groups could explained
 potential ceiling effect observed baseline for the HC group 
regards their MSL capacity both the behavioural and cerebral
level Given that HC individuals already showed good MSL capacity
prior AET they obviously had less room for sequence specic behavioural improvement compared PD patients This supported the
fact that analysis the behavioural results revealed that while HC individuals improved their motor performance both random and sequence condition after AET they also maintained similar magnitude
 RT difference between these two conditions Duchesne 
This pattern results can interpreted HC individuals having 
more efcient medial temporal lobe CS CC functioning networks
prior AET compared PD patients which leaves also less room
for improvements seen functional activity these brain areas

individuals
Limitations and conclusions
In the current study found that AET related and MSL specic
changes the cerebellum correlated negatively with changes aerobic
capacity Although apparently contradictory this result can 
interpreted light several lines evidence from previous studies 
First changes the cerebellum have been interpreted compensatory functional system animal models PD model following exercise
 Holschneider Yang Guo and Maarek Wang Guo Myers 
Heintz and Holschneider Wang Guo Myers Heintz Peng 
Maarek and Holschneider and similar assumption has been
proposed following striatal dysfunction PD Doyon Second 
human studies have indicated that both the cortico striatal CS and
cortico cerebellar CC systems play distinctive roles MSL Doyon 
 Doyon and Benali Doyon Leggio and
Molinari despite the fact that cerebellum and basal ganglia are
known interconnected Bostan and Strick Hoshi 
Tremblay Feger Carras and Strick Given the interaction between the CC and CS systems during MSL Doyon Doyon 
 Doyon and Benali and the fact that previous functional imaging data revealed that cerebellar hemispheres are hyperactivated 
while the striatum hypoactivated PD patients compared 
healthy controls Yu Sternad Corcos and Vaillancourt 
thus possible that the cerebellum capable compensating for the decient basal ganglia activity observed PD Hence the current study 
the PD participants who improved less their aerobic capacity used predominantly the cerebellum during MSL whereas those who had higher
changes aerobic tness used more the hippocampus and striatum 
One the limitations our study was the heterogeneity the patient population Similar many other studies with PD patients disease
characteristics were diverse motor cognitive neuropsychiatric 
etc In fact was often challenge control for all symptoms and obtain homogeneous sample However used several strategies address this limitation First matched the PD group with the HC group
with respect sex distribution age years education cognitive and
tness level In addition given that the two groups differed their depression and anxiety symptoms accounted for these variables our
statistical analyses considering them covariates the analyses 
the behavioural data Another limitation our study was the lack 
PD control group for the type exercise Despite this constraint however worth noting the fact that conducted regression analysis
highlighting that there were functional brain changes that were related
 changes aerobic tness level which indicate that there were brain
changes specic the AET program PD patients 
To conclude this study the rst assess the neural correlates 
MSL following AET PD Functional reorganisation brain activity 
early PD following aerobic training was observed within the hippocampus the striatum and the cerebellum resulting improvement their
learning capacity Most importantly the same brain structures albeit
 different sub regions have also showed that MSL specic brain
plasticity correlated with changes aerobic tness showing positive
relationship within the hippocampus and the striatum and negative
relationship within the cerebellum Altogether our study makes two important contributions the eld First show that week

progressive aerobic training regimen has benecial effects motor
skill learning sedentary PD and healthy individuals Second highlight the neurophysiological changes underlying exercise dependent
plasticity PD with particular emphasis the neuronal substrate 
MSL Our results thus pave the way for other studies further explore
the structural and functional organization within brain regions and how
exercise dependent plasticity manifests itself within the medial temporal lobe CS and CC systems following chronic acute bouts aerobic
activities PD As result these ndings have important clinical implications for the rehabilitation PD individuals the design and the use
