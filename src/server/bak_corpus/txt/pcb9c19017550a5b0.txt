Introduction
Although Parkinsons disease PD primarily characterized several motor symptoms including tremor rigidity 
and bradykinesia frequently accompanied other
nonmotor symptoms such depression anxiety fatigue 
and sleep disturbance Among these depression one
 the most common nonmotor symptoms PD and the
prevalence major depressive disorder was reported 
 PD patients according the meta analysis If
minor depression and dysthymia are included the prevalence increases PD population much higher
than that general population The underlying neurobiological mechanism the close association between
PD and depression not well defined It possible that
disabling symptoms PD may cause distress and negative
feelings However number studies have suggested that

degeneration the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways
may related depression PD 
To investigate the neural substrates underlying depressive symptoms PD only few studies using singlephoton emission computed tomography SPECT have
examined regional cerebral blood flow rCBF the PD
patients with and without depression However the results
regarding rCBF differences between the depressed and
nondepressed PD patients have been inconsistent One
study revealed increased rCBF the fronto parietal areas
 the depressed PD patients whereas rCBF reduction
 the frontal cortex was found the depressed PD group
 the other study Furthermore the sample sizes 
these studies were relatively small 
This study aimed assess alterations rCBF 
depressed PD patients compared with nondepressed PD
group using mTc hexamethyl propylene amine oxime
 HMPAO SPECT Since the whole brain voxel wise
analysis the SPECT images might miss rCBF differences regional level further used region ofinterest ROI approach for the major limbic areas which
are implicated depression averaging all voxel
values within each region Finally the relationships
between rCBF and the severity depression were
examined 
Materials and methods
Participants
Patients who had been diagnosed PD without history 
other neurological and psychiatric disorders were recruited
 Incheon St Marys Hospital Incheon South Korea 
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and the study protocol was approved the Research
Ethics Committee 
The severity PD symptoms was evaluated with the
HoehnYahr Scale The Korean Mini Mental State
Examination MMSE was used assess global cognitive
function The total score ranges from with 
higher score indicating better cognitive performance 
The cut off score was suggested for screening 
dementia Depressive symptoms were examined
using the Korean version the Geriatric Depressive
Scale GDS The total score ranges from and
 higher score represents greater depressive symptoms 
The cut off score was suggested for screening 
depression Participants were divided into the
depressed and nondepressed PD groups based the cutoff score the GDS 
Image acquisition
All participants were scanned min after intravenous
injection MBq HMPAO using dual head
gamma camera ECAM plus Siemens Medical Erlangen 
Germany The participants were rested supine position
with their eyes open low light and low noise environment during the scan All images were attenuation
corrected and reconstructed matrix with 
voxel size field view 
using filtered back projection 
Image processing and analysis
Statistical Parametric Mapping Wellcome
Department Cognitive Neurology Institute Neurology London UK was used for image processing and
statistical modelling All images were spatially normalized
 the SPM SPECT template Montreal Neurological
Institute McGill University Montreal Canada and resliced with voxel size The SPM
binary brain mask was applied remove extracerebral
signal The images were smoothed with fullwidth half maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel 
A voxel wise two sample test was conducted 
examine differences rCBF between the two groups with
age and gender nuisance covariates Global counts were
normalized mL min with proportional scaling 
and relative threshold masking was applied The
statistical threshold was set uncorrected 
voxel level with extent threshold voxels Normalized rCBF values were extracted from each significant
cluster using MarsBar toolbox version http marsbar 
sourceforge net 
For the ROI analysis four bilateral ROIs the limbic
system were selected based the previous review 
neuroimaging studies depression the amygdala 
anterior cingulate cortex hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus The WFU PickAtlas toolbox version 
 http fmri wfubmc edu software pickatlas was used
 create binary masks for these ROIs using the Automated
Anatomical Labeling atlas Normalized rCBF value 
each ROI was extracted using MarsBar toolbox 
Statistical analysis
Differences continuous variables between two groups
were examined with independent tests MannWhitney
U tests Chi square test was used compare the ratio 
gender 
To assess correlations between rCBF and depressive
symptoms multiple linear regressions were performed 
Ann Nucl Med
the depressed PD group with normalized rCBF value from
each cluster independent variable and the GDS score
 dependent variable while adjusting for age and gender For each ROI difference the normalized rCBF
between the two groups was assessed using multiple linear
regression with age and gender covariates interest 
A two tailed value less than without correction
for multiple comparison was considered statistically significant since the correlation and ROI analyses were based
 specific hypotheses All analyses were conducted with

Discussion
Results
A total patients with PD were included this study 
Among them patients were classified into the depressed
PD group while the rest patients was assigned the
nondepressed PD group based the GDS scores No
patients were antidepressant medication the time 
the assessments Demographic and clinical characteristics
 the participants were presented Table Although the
two groups did not differ age the duration 
PD symptoms the duration PD treatment
 the HoehnYahr score the levodopa equivalent dose and the MMSE score
 these two groups had statistically different
gender distributions with more women the depressed
PD group The mean GDS score the
depressed PD group mean range was
higher than that the nondepressed PD group mean
 range 
Results from the voxel wise SPM analysis were summarized Table and Fig The depressed PD group
showed increased rCBF the left cuneus cluster
size voxels In contrast significantly lower rCBF was
found the right superior temporal gyrus 
cluster size voxels and right medial orbitofrontal
The current brain perfusion SPECT study investigated
differences rCBF between the depressed and nondepressed PD patients Correlations between rCBF and the
severity depressive symptoms were also examined the
depressed PD group We found increased rCBF the
cuneus and perfusion reduction the superior temporal
gyrus medial orbitofrontal cortex and four limbic ROIs 
including the anterior cingulate cortex amygdala hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus the depressed
PD group In addition the rCBF the cuneus cluster was
positively associated with depressive symptoms the
depressed PD patients 
The voxel wise image analysis revealed that the
depressed PD group relative the nondepressed group
showed higher rCBF the cuneus and occipital areas
which were associated with their greater depressive
symptoms In line with these results the previous study
using PET demonstrated the dysphoria related topographic
pattern glucose metabolism PD patients which was
characterized metabolic increases the medial occipital areas and the decrease the frontal lobe 
Increased glucose metabolism the cuneus and surrounding areas has also been implicated geriatric
depression PD patients Furthermore the

depression Inverse correlations between the GABA levels
and rCBF the brain have also been suggested the
previous literature Further studies are warranted
 examine structural functional metabolic changes 
the occipital area and potential visual impairments PD
with depression since both subjective visual deficits 
and changes visual evoked potential were
observed patients with major depression 
On the other hand decreased rCBF the superior
temporal and medial orbitofrontal cortices was found the
depressed PD patients These results correspond with the
findings the previous neuroimaging studies major
depression that have consistently reported both functional
and structural alterations these areas The
superior temporal gyrus combination with the frontolimbic areas orbitofrontal cortex amygdala and anterior
cingulate cortex has been known involved emotional processing and social cognition Functional
neuroimaging studies demonstrated that patients with
major depression exhibited abnormal functional connectivity and decreased activation rest sad stimuli
 this region Furthermore regional volume 
superior temporal gyrus was negatively associated with
severity depressive symptoms The rCBF decrease
 the medial orbitofrontal area line with the previous
studies that revealed hypometabolism the same region 
depressed PD patients when compared with nondepressed
PD patients Interestingly the orbitofrontal cortex 
which has reciprocal connections with both the ventral
tegmental area and dorsal raphe may play important roles
 the pathophysiology depression with PD 
Although still speculative the degeneration dopaminergic system may cause the functional deficits orbitofrontal cortex which turn may affect serotonergic
system and cause depressive symptoms 
The ROI analysis this study revealed lower rCBF 
the limbic system including the anterior cingulate cortex 
amygdala hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus the
depressed PD patients Lower rCBF the anterior cingulate cortex was also suggested from the previous report
 However rCBF alterations the amygdala hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus have not been
suggested the previous studies depressed PD patients
 In addition perfusion studies major
depression have also demonstrated inconsistent results
regarding the activation the limbic regions Our
results suggest that depression with PD may characterized coherent decreases rCBF the major limbic
areas 
Potential limitations this study include group difference gender ratio although gender was covaried out
 the statistical analyses The epidemiological and other
studies PD showed controversial results whether there 
 gender difference the prevalence comorbid
depression while gender difference major
depression has been well documented However there
 still possibility that neural correlates depression 
PD may different between genders and therefore further studies are warranted investigate this issue The
reliance the self report questionnaires for the assessment depressive symptoms another weakness this
study due the potential response bias Complementary
use structured clinical interviews would helpful 
future research 
In summary this study identified the regional pattern 
brain perfusion that distinguished depressed from nondepressed PD patients Hyperperfusion the occipital area
and hypoperfusion the fronto temporo limbic regions
may potential imaging biomarkers for depression PD 
However although the mean rCBF values the ROIs
significantly differed between depresssed and nondepressed PD groups the perfusion ranges considerably
overlapped between the two groups Therefore our findings should confirmed and validated prospective
studies with larger cohort for the development reliable
and robust biomarkers for depression PD
