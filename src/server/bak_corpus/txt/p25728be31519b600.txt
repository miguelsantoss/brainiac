Abstract
Background Alzheimers disease AD the most common cause dementia the elderly The possibility 
disease modifying strategies has evoked need for early and accurate diagnosis To improve the accuracy the
clinical diagnosis AD biomarkers like cerebrospinal fluid CSF and neuroimaging techniques like magnetic
resonance imaging MRI and positron emission tomography PET have been incorporated into the diagnostic
guidelines AD 
Case presentation In this case report outline reference one our patients with presenile dementia the
current approaches the diagnosis AD The patient was year old woman presenting with progressive
memory decline CSF A was normal while P tau was slightly increased FDG PET indicated pattern typical for
AD amyloid PET showed extensive global amyloid load and tau PET depicted pronounced hippocampal tracer
accumulation The MRI scan was rated normal routine diagnostics however quantitative volumetric analysis
revealed significant atrophy especially the parietal lobe The combination biomarkers and neuroimaging
techniques was therefore suggestive underlying AD pathology 
Conclusions To enable early and accurate diagnosis AD and thereby also patient recruitment for anti tau 
anti amyloid therapeutic trials combination biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques seems useful

Background
Alzheimers disease AD the most common cause 
dementia and estimated affect million people
worldwide the year It clinically characterized progressive memory and language impairment 
functional and behavioural disturbances and visuospatial
deficits A definite diagnosis AD still relies postmortem histopathological detection intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid plaques It
 widely acknowledged that histopathological changes
start years before clinical manifestation the disease 
As first disease modifying therapies are approaching early
and accurate diagnosis AD becomes increasingly
important Therefore the National Institute Aging
and the Alzheimers Association have revised the criteria
for the diagnosis AD To assess the probability

Case presentation
A year old retired attorney with years education presented with three year history progressive
memory decline For about one year she hadnt been
able the shopping the cooking No behavioural
changes language impairment severe fluctuations 
attention and alertness recurrent visual hallucinations
 history repetitive brain trauma were reported 
Family history was positive her mother well 
uncle had developed late onset dementia 
The Mini Mental State Examination which had been
performed three years ago because subjective memory
impairment had been rated normal For neuropsychological testing applied the CERAD plus battery

additionally including Trail Making Test A and B well
 verbal fluency tests The scores almost all domains
 the CERAD plus battery were least standard
deviations below the age and education adjusted norm
values She scored out points the MiniMental State Examination Naming Boston Naming test 
was intact whereas phonemic verbal fluency was slightly
 words min and semantic fluency words 
 min was highly reduced Memory was highly impaired 
She displayed intrusions and showed reduced performance word list recall and recognition Constructional
practice was impaired well Results the Trail Making
Test showed reduced visual attention well reduced
speed processing Cognitive flexibility measured 
Trail Making Test B was also poor 
At first presentation the neurological examination was
normal In particular manifest latent paresis and 
sensory deficit could detected Deep tendon reflexes
were mildly hypoactive without any pathological reflexes 
Cranial nerves were also intact There was evidence 
extrapyramidal features 
Laboratory tests for metabolic causes dementia for
example for vitamin thyroid liver and renal function 
thiamine level and folate were within the normal range 
P tau N cerebrospinal fluid CSF 
was only slightly increased whereas total Tau 
N and A N were
normal All other CSF parameters were within the normal
range 
The MRI scan which had been performed three years
ago well the MRI scan first presentation were
interpreted normal visual inspection Especially 
sign global regional atrophy could detected However atlas based volumetric MRI analysis showed 
significant reduction especially temporal and parietal
lobe volumes Z scores for the hippocampal and parietal
volumes compared healthy controls were and 
respectively Fig 
Moreover quantitative analysis based voxel wise

matter segments from age and sex matched control
sample after bias correction and spatial normalization 
common standard space following established method
 showed slight asymmetry with more pronounced

noted that for the quantitative analysis data the comparison group came from another MRI scanner than the

In addition glucose metabolism the posterior cingulate
cortex was significantly reduced Fig 
The patient underwent florbetaben PET FBB PET 
scan which showed extensive FBB retention that was
greater parietotemporal frontal and posterior cingulate precuneus cortex and less pronounced the occipital
cortex Basal ganglia were also slightly affected Fig 
The tau PET scan with the other hand
showed high tracer retention both hippocampi well
 moderately increased tracer retention parietotemporal cortical areas There was elevated tracer retention other cortical areas Fig 
Conclusions
As our patient presented with three year history 
cognitive decline that interfered with activities daily
living and scored low almost all domains the CERAD
plus battery clinical diagnosis AD was made 
Because the presenile age onset and the positive
family history monogenic form AD might possible 
Genetic testing could have excluded conditions mimicking
sporadic AD like dementia Our patient however refused
genetic testing Sensitivity and specificity the clinical
diagnosis AD compared post mortem histopathological diagnosis ranges from and from 
 respectively The combination biomarkers
and neuroimaging techniques was suggestive underlying AD pathology In absence neuropathological

diagnosis case presenile dementia are dementia with
Lewy bodies DLB frontotemporal dementia with memory
impairment FTD and chronic traumatic encephalopathy
 CTE As our patient had pronounced variation 
attention and alertness reported recurrent visual hallucinations and displayed features parkinsonism the
core features DLB were not fulfilled Furthermore
 progressive deterioration personality social comportment was reported and there was evidence 
progressive language impairment Therefore there was 
clinical evidence for behavioural variant frontotemporal

patient FBB PET scan revealed massive global amyloid load
with pronounced FBB retention parietotemporal frontal

retention was markedly elevated the hippocampus whereas
onlya slightly increased retention was observed 
parietotemporal cortical areas
Neuropsychological testing commonly used 
aid diagnosing AD In our patient the scores almost
all domains the CERAD plus battery were well below
average Memory was most severely affected As the
earliest pathological changes AD occur medial
temporal lobe structures episodic memory usually
the first cognitive ability decline typically followed 
like our case additional deficits language and
semantic knowledge executive functions working memory attention and visuospatial abilities 
Results laboratory testing for example for vitamin 
thyroid function thiamine level and folate were within the
normal range Laboratory testing should performed 
every AD patient rule out metabolic causes dementia 
CSF did not suggest malignancy neuroinflammation 
infection P tau that reflects the intensity neuronal degeneration was slightly increased Interestingly although
amyloid PET revealed extensive global amyloid load 
CSF A the other hand was normal It has been
shown that amyloid load autopsy AD patients 
inversely correlated CSF A whereas tau load 
positively correlated CSF P tau and total tau Yet
although CSF and amyloid PET measurements A
are consistent the majority patients dissociation

between A measurements not uncommon 
Especially the combination CSF biomarkers may increase diagnostic certainty AD pathology Yet CSF
biomarkers not change during the clinical phase 
AD they cannot used markers disease progression
 In comparison AD patients DLB and FTD
patients present significantly lower P tau and total tau
levels There however some overlap CSF P tau
and total tau between AD DLB and FTD patients A 
generally decreased DLB Most studies could not define
valuable CSF A cut off scores for differentiation 
DLB from AD CSF A levels FTD patients 
the other hand are significantly higher compared AD
patients The combination CSF P tau total tau and
A has shown high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity
 distinguishing AD from DLB and FTD patients In CTE
one would expect normal CSF A levels and elevated
P tau total tau ratio Large biomarker studies 
autopsy confirmed CTE cases however are lacking AS
CSF P tau was only slightly increased while CSF total tau
and A were within the normal range CSF analysis was
not suggestive underlying AD pathology our case 
The MRI scan was interpreted normal routine
diagnostics especially sign normal pressure hydrocephalus cerebrovascular disease tumours regional 
global atrophy could detected Volumetric MRI analysis
however revealed significant atrophy the parietal and
temporal lobe especially the hippocampus and may
therefore useful obtain rater independent and
objective results Comparison atrophy patterns
can differentiate AD patients with high sensitivity and
specificity from healthy controls and other dementia syndromes like DLB and FTD In DLB significant gray
matter loss detectable bilateral amygdalae the middle
temporal lobe well the dorsal ponto mesencephalic
junction area In FTD patients atrophy normally
restricted the frontal and temporal lobes with relative
sparing the parietal and occipital lobes MRI may also
 useful detect neuropathological changes observed 
CTE like whole brain atrophy cavum septum pellucidum with occasional fenestration In our case volumetric MRI analysis showed typical AD atrophy pattern
with pronounced atrophy the parietal and temporal
lobe especially the hippocampus and therefore supported
the diagnosis AD In Alzheimers disease patients especially hippocampal atrophy Fig seems highly
correlated with episodic memory impairment 
In the FDG PET scan Fig the typical AD pattern
consisting reduction cerebral glucose metabolism
 precuneus posterior cingulate and parietotemporal
association cortices could detected In comparison 
DLB patients show additional significant metabolic
reduction the occipital cortex particularly the primary
visual cortex which distinguishes DLB with high

sensitivity and specificity from AD patients FTD 
the other hand causes hypometabolism the frontal
lobes the anterior temporal cortex and anterior cingulate
cortex FDG PET studies that evaluated glucose
metabolism subjects with repetitive brain trauma have
shown inconsistent findings In summary FDGPET clearly supported AD the most probable diagnosis
 our case Like structural MRI FDG PET represents 
marker neuronal injury Retrospective investigations
showed sensitivity and specificity for
FDG PET predicting post mortem AD pathology 
autopsy FDG PET thereby outperformed the initial
clinical evaluation Furthermore FDG PET seems 
suitable predictor conversion AD patients with
mild cognitive impairment 
Amyloid and tau Pet represent new diagnostic tools 
To present definite diagnosis AD relies postmortem histopathology Yet these new imaging techniques
permit non invasive visualization and quantification the
two histological hallmarks the disease 
Amyloid PET showed characteristic increase tracer
uptake cortical regions known have high amount
 amyloid burden AD frontal parietal and lateral
temporal cortex Fig DLB patients can show similar
pattern yet with lower amount A ligand binding compared with AD patients FTD patients the other
hand display low cortical tracer retention such that amyloid PET has shown high accuracy discriminating AD
from FTD Variable degrees diffuse amyloid
can detected about autopsy confirmed CTE
cases Amyloid PET may therefore differentiate
between CTE and AD identifying different amyloiddeposition patterns Further studies are needed determine the topography amyloid depositions CTE 
Showing high amount tracer uptake parietotemporal frontal and posterior cingulate precuneus cortex 
FBB PET was suggestive for AD our case Recent phase
III studies which the vivo uptake F labelled
amyloid tracers was compared post mortem amyloid
load showed sensitivity and specificity and
 respectively for the detection amyloid deposits AD patients As amyloid deposition
probably represents very early event the course the
disease that occurs years before onset dementia symptoms amyloid PET may allow early and even presymptomatic diagnosis 
Increased tau tracer retention could detected 
parietotemporal cortical areas especially the hippocampus Fig In contrast amyloid PET the sensitivity and
specificity tau PET imaging have yet determined 
Post mortem studies have shown that the amount tau
deposition highly related the severity dementia
 In addition aiding the early and differential
diagnosis Alzheimers disease tau PET may therefore

deposition elevated some cases DLB especially 
the inferior temporal region Tau PET scans may

Hitherto single case report patient with clinical

tau PET also supported diagnosis AD our case

As some the illustrated diagnostic approaches provided converging evidence CSF P tau MRI FDGPET and Tau PET each indicated AD typical neuronal

widely available diagnostic tools like neuropsychological
testing establish the diagnosis dementia syndrome

 baseline testing could help select patients that profit
