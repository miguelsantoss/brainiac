Article abstractObjective To compare global and regional atrophy MRI subjects with dementia with Lewy bodies
 DLB AD vascular dementia VaD and normal aging In addition the relationship between APOE genotype and
volumetric indices was examined Method MRI based volume measurements the whole brain ventricles frontal lobe 
temporal lobe hippocampus and amygdala were acquired elderly subjects with DLB mean age years 
AD years VaD years and normal control subjects years Results Subjects with
DLB had significantly larger temporal lobe hippocampal and amygdala volumes than those with AD No significant
volumetric difference between subjects with DLB and VaD was observed Compared with control subjects ventricular
volumes were increased all patients with dementia though those with DLB showed relative preservation wholebrain volume There were significant differences frontal lobe volumes between the four groups APOE status was
not associated with volumetric indices Conclusion The findings support the hypothesis that DLB associated with 
relative preservation temporal lobe structures In the differentiation DLB and AD this may have important
implications for diagnosis Key words Dementia with Lewy bodiesAlzheimers diseaseVascular dementiaMRI

NEUROLOGY 
Dementia with Lewy bodies DLB characterized
 fluctuating cognitive impairment persistent visual hallucinosis and parkinsonism It the second
most common form degenerative dementia and
may account for cases late life dementia Ante mortem diagnosis DLB and its differentiation from other common forms late onset
dementias particularly AD and vascular dementia
 VaD important for number reasons Some
patients with DLB may have accelerated disease
progression and approximately subjects experience life threatening adverse reactions antipsychotic medications neuroleptic sensitivity In
contrast subjects with DLB may have enhanced
therapeutic response treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors 
Volumetric MRI may provide important supplementary information that could support counter

MRI DLB compared with AD Information regarding
other structural features that may differentiate DLB
from AD are inconclusive and there has been detailed volumetric comparison DLB and VaD date 
A number recent studies reported association between the APOE genotype and specific
morphologic changes identified neuroimaging 
subjects with AD No consistent link has been
identified and the relationship between volumetric
indices MRI and APOE status DLB has not
been characterized 
The purpose this study was compare the extent global and regional atrophy MRI patients with DLB AD and VaD and age comparable
normal control subjects We also examined the relationship between APOE status and volumetric indices these subjects We hypothesized that
subjects with DLB would have less temporal lobe
atrophy than those with AD and VaD 
Methods Recruitment subjects Seventy six subjects
over age years who fulfilled Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual Mental Disorders Edition DSM IV criteria for dementia were recruited from communitydwelling population patients with informant 
regular contact Seventy two these subjects were prospectively chosen from clinical case consecutive referrals old age psychiatry services All potential
subjects the register were assessed for their
suitability take part the study whether they met the
entry criteria could give consent and were willing take
part the study could cooperate and tolerate having 
MRI scan and exhibited the absence medical contraindications for MRI An additional four subjects were recruited
from specialist dementia clinic Twenty six age matched
controls were recruited from among spouses and friends 
dementia subjects The local ethics committee approved
the research and all subjects well the nearest relative for patients gave informed consent after the nature 
the procedures had been fully explained 
Assessments and diagnosis All dementia subjects
were assessed previously described Cognitive function
was measured using the Cambridge Cognitive Examination CAMCOG which incorporates the Mini Mental
State Examination MMSE within months the MRI

Results As shown table groups were comparable
for age gender length 
history and years education Ninety five percent subjects were right hand dominant with group differences 
As would expected CAMCOG and MMSE scores were
lower all dementia groups compared with control subjects Subjects with DLB were more impaired
than those with VaD MMSE versus 
and CAMCOG versus scores 
Mean normalized and raw volumes for each ROI are
shown table Differences between control and dementia subjects are summarized table and between subjects with DLB and other dementia subjects table 
Measured volumes Control subjects had larger normalized whole brain volumes compared with AD 
 and VaD but not DLB patients There was trend for DLB subjects have larger
whole brain volumes than those with AD but
not VaD 
Ventricular volume was smaller contrast compared 
all dementia groups 
There were differences between dementia subjects 
There were significant differences normalized frontal
lobe volumes between control and dementia subjects 
Control subjects had larger normalized temporal lobe
volumes compared all dementia groups 
Subjects with DLB had larger temporal lobe volumes compared those with AD versus 
Control subjects had larger hippocampi compared all
dementia groups Subjects with DLB had
larger hippocampi than those with AD but not
VaD AD subjects also had smaller hippocampi
than those with VaD 
Controls had larger amygdalae compared subjects
with AD and VaD but not DLB 
Subjects with DLB had larger left and right amygdalae
than those with AD 
Stepwise linear regression was used examine the relationship between hippocampal volume the different dementia subtypes and factors that may influence brain
volume age gender MMSE score APOE status history hypertension Significant variables were diagnosis AD Beta MMSE score Beta 
 and diagnosis VaD Beta 
 Together these variables predicted the
variance 
APOE and volumetric indices There were significant differences volumetric indices between negative
and positive subjects for all dementia groups Within each
dementia group there were significant differences 
age duration illness and cognitive impairment between
 negative and positive subjects In addition APOE 
status did not predict atrophy for any volumetric indices 
dementia subjects using linear regression 
Discussion This study examined MRI volumetric
differences subjects with DLB AD VaD and normal subjects Subjects with DLB had significantly
larger temporal lobe hippocampal and amygdala
volumes than those with AD with trend toward
larger whole brain volumes Overall there were

tween all subjects Total ventricular volumes were
nonspecifically increased all subjects with dementia Atrophy was not associated with presence 
APOE 
The strengths this study included the recruitment community based elderly subjects with latelife dementia with comparable age sex education 
and duration illness Volumetric differences between groups were therefore unlikely related 
differences age gender A potential criticism 
this study would the reliance clinical rather
than pathologic diagnoses However previously
 clinical diagnoses were made after detailed assessments and accordance with standardized criteria 
A major finding this study was that subjects
with DLB had significantly larger whole temporal
lobes hippocampi and amygdalae than those with
AD This consistent with and further extends our
previous observation using visual rating medial
temporal lobe atrophy the same sample A similar
pattern differential hippocampal atrophy AD
and DLB has been reported although the volume
loss dementia subjects was less extensive addition there was difference amygdala volume 
These discrepancies need explored further but
may reflect variations methodology and sample
selection our subjects were average 
years older had had dementia for longer period 
and had lower MMSE scores 
Importantly the differential pattern temporal
lobe atrophy DLB and AD during life consistent
with autopsy studies The convergence findings
suggest that the differentiation DLB from AD 
the preservation temporal lobe structures especially the hippocampus supportive clinical
diagnosis DLB Pathologically this may explained the relative absence AD type pathology
 DLB especially neurofibrillary tangles 
All three dementia groups had more extensive
temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy when compared with age matched controls In relation AD 
this highly consistent with well established and may relate the extent tangle pathology Previous studies have also reported
increased atrophy temporal lobe structures both
subjects with Lewy body and 
when compared with normal controls The pathologic
basis these findings less clear Further neuropathologic studies are necessary order clarify
the relationship any between concurrent AD type
pathology and temporal lobe atrophy MRI subjects with DLB and VaD It would important 
determine whether MTA life marker AD type
pathology not only AD but also other disorders
where comorbid processes may interacting 
Measures global atrophy demonstrated significant enlargement ventricles dementia subjects
compared with control subjects Patients with DLB 
however had relatively well preserved whole brain
parenchyma volume Autopsy studies indicating NEUROLOGY 
March 
ative preservation synapse and neuronal counts subjects with may explain this
relative conservation overall brain volume 
Frontal lobe volumes were similar all three dementia groups In relation DLB and AD this replicates the finding autopsy and our
MRI pilot using different cohort subjects 
As such the results did not confirm previous reports
 association between frontal lobe atrophy and
Lewy body although once again comparisons between studies are complicated differences methodology patient selection and the
relative small number subjects 
There were significant differences frontal
lobe volumes between control and dementia subjects 
This may reflect the limitations our measurement 
which was restricted the anterior third the frontal lobe Alternatively could indicate that changes
 frontal lobe volume are relatively normal feature
 successful aging that subjects with dementia
atrophy may only emerge late stage the progression the illness This could account for the
discrepancies between ante mortem and post mortem studies noted above 
Overall observed MRI volumetric differences between DLB and VaD This suggests other
structural changes particular cerebral infarcts 
possibly conjunction with white matter changes 
are likely more useful discriminating these
conditions Given that subjects with VaD performed
better tests cognitive function raises the possibility that differences neurochemical substrates may
underlie the cognitive impairment DLB 
The role APOE the pathogenesis dementias remains determined In particular studies
examining the relationship between the APOE allele and neuroimaging changes have far produced
contrasting findings Our results accord with
those Jack found association between volumetric indices and the presence the
APOE allele Further this finding was observed
 subjects with AD well those with DLB and
VaD Although still controversial this finding suggests atrophic processes are not directly linked the
presence APOE allele 
There growing body evidence from both 
vivo MRI and autopsy studies suggest that the
consensus criteria for should modified 
emphasize the relative preservation temporal lobe
structures DLB compared with AD
