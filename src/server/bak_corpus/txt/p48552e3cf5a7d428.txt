Abstract We present practical guide for the implementation recently revised National Institute Aging
Alzheimers Association guidelines for the neuropathologic
assessment Alzheimers disease AD Major revisions
from previous consensus criteria are recognition that
AD neuropathologic changes may occur the apparent
absence cognitive impairment ABC score for
AD neuropathologic change that incorporates histopathologic assessments amyloid deposits A staging 
neurofibrillary tangles B and scoring neuritic plaques
 C and more detailed approaches for assessing commonly morbid conditions such Lewy body disease 
vascular brain injury hippocampal sclerosis and TAR

Introduction
A consensus panel from the United States and Europe was
convened recently update and revise the 
consensus guidelines for the neuropathologic evaluation 
Alzheimers disease AD Here summarize these
consensus guidelines and provide direction for their
application 
Clinico pathologic correlation
Alzheimers disease refers constellation cognitive
and behavioral changes that are typical for patients who
have substantial amounts its hallmark lesions 
Similar neuropathologic changes albeit usually lower
levels also occur individuals who did not show cognitive behavioral impairments during life We
recommend that neuropathologists adopt the term AD
neuropathologic change and report the presence and
extent lesions observed autopsy regardless the
individuals cognitive state even cognitive state not
known 
AD neuropathologic change should assessed all
cases dementia There are many other neurodegenerative
disorders that can cause dementia addition those
discussed here and any may morbid with AD neuropathologic change especially the elderly We
recommend that all lesions documented for type and
extent morbidity brains individuals with AD
neuropathologic change 
Multiple diseases cerebrum can conspire worsen
cognitive symptoms however often difficult judge
the extent which each disease observed autopsy may
have contributed given patients cognitive state It 
essential that the extent AD neuropathologic change 
well neuropathologic findings for any other disease that may have contributed cognitive impairment
 dementia correlated with clinical neuropsychological neuro imaging and other laboratory data part the
neuropathology report

Work cases
Autopsy should follow best practices and local regulations 
Gross inspection brain should include assessment 
regional atrophy and blood vessels for cerebrovascular
disease CVD We recommend minimum sampling 
brain regions Table All gross lesions also should 
sampled Each the following sections indicates preferred
and acceptable alternative methods for detection neuropathologic changes While not propose specific
protocols our recommendations are compatible with conclusions others who have optimized reproducibility
 some neuropathologic assessments across multiple sites
 We anticipate further efforts for increased
harmonization and molecular specification Finally 
although organized for brain autopsy these neuropathologic
assessments can applied specimens from surgery 
however regional evaluation will limited biopsy
specimens 
AD neuropathologic change
Senile plaques which are extracellular deposits the
 amyloid Ab peptides and neurofibrillary degeneration 
which best exemplified neurofibrillary tangles
 NFTs are considered essential neuropathologic features
 AD Accumulation Ab plaques and NFTs follows
distinct regional progressions across brain regions AD
advances We recommend continued use the staging
scheme for neurofibrillary degeneration described originally Braak and Braak reduced four stages
 Table that improves inter rater reliability We
recommend modified version Thal phases Ab plaque accumulation adapted four point scale
 Table A subset senile plaques called neuritic plaques appear closely associated with neuronal injury and are
characterized the occurrence dystrophic neurites that
frequently have phospho tau immunoreactivity 
 We recommend continued use the Consortium 
Establish Registry for AD CERAD protocol for neuritic
plaque scoring Table 
Method
Preferred method for amyloid Ab plaques immunohistochemistry for Ab and for neurofibrillary tangles
 NFTs immunohistochemistry for tau phospho tau
 Other acceptable methods are Thioflavin S sensitive silver histochemical stains It important 
stress that neuritic plaques need distinguished from
Ab deposits special stains Preferred methods for
detection neuritic processes senile plaques are

particularly tauopathies should considered Such cases may not fit easily into specific Braak stage which intended for categorization 
AD type NFTs
High levels neuritic plaques setting low Thal phase rare occurrence and should prompt reconsideration neuritic versus diffuse

occurs frequently the olfactory bulb older adults and
should sampled when possible 
Reporting

Clinico pathologic correlation for individuals without
cognitive impairment should indicate that although much
less common than AD neuropathologic change LBD has
been observed individuals without apparent cognitive 
motor deficit this may represent pre clinical LBD
 For individuals with cognitive impairment 
recommend that Neocortical LBD considered adequate explanation cognitive impairment dementia

contribution from other diseases Brainstem predominant

prompt consideration other diseases Amygdala predominant LBD typically occurs the context

incomplete clinical history note that Neocortical
LBD correlated with greater likelihood cognitive
impairment 
Cerebrovascular disease and vascular brain injury

encountered the brains with AD neuropathologic change

majority cases HS Fig about onehalf cases with FTLD and ubiquitin inclusions with 
without motor neuron disease most sporadic cases

AD neuropathologic change with LBD

exception individuals with mutations TARDBP GRN 
VCP not clear whether

 primary secondary coincidental event 
Method and classification
HS should evaluated hematoxylin and eosin H E stained sections together with neurofibrillary tangle NFT 
stains HS can focal thus its absence the recommended screening section does not rule out the possibility
 HS elsewhere the hippocampal formation If HS 
present further evaluation indicated including 
immunohistochemistry If work negative for 
Acta Neuropathol 
but there other evidence suggest FTLD consider
immunohistochemistry for phospho tau ubiquitin 
fused sarcoma FUS In the absence HS screening
for inclusions part evaluating AD neuropathologic change unclear value 
Reporting
HS should reported present absent with 
description immunohistochemistry results 
Clinico pathological correlations need recognize that
HS can occur several different diseases and has varying
clinical implications different settings Relatively isolated HS may occur very old individuals and this
context associated with immunoreactive
inclusions and with cognitive impairment 
Frontotemporal lobar degeneration and prion disease
Both these classes neurodegenerative diseases are
complex and beyond the scope this summary Nevertheless each must distinguished from AD
neuropathologic change We refer the reader recent
consensus guidelines for the neuropathologic evaluation 
FTLD and its subtypes and issues important 
the distinction AD neuropathologic change from those
 some forms FTLD Finally not only can the
neuropathologic changes prion disease morbid
with AD but some forms prion disease can overlap with
AD and need distinguished with special stains 
Summary
The new consensus criteria recognize the continuum AD
neuropathologic change that underlies the progression 
this disease from preclinical dementia stage The new
consensus criteria also amplify methods for evaluating Ab
plaques better define intermediate levels AD pathologic
change and emphasize structured approach commonly
 morbid diseases
