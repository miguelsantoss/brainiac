Background Parkinsons disease PD characterized motor dysfunction and cognitive decline may demonstrate specic patterns brain atrophy Although cross sectional magnetic resonance imaging MRI studies
show correlation between regional brain volume loss and cognitive impairment there only scarce evidence
from longitudinal studies validating the link between cognition and brain anatomy PD 
Objective To test the relationship between magnitude and spatial extent atrophy PD patients with progressive signicant cognitive decline and dementia PDD 
Methods We followed thirty three initially non demented patients with prevalent PD for three years while monitoring cognitive function and brain atrophy Longitudinally acquired weighted magnetic resonance images
were analyzed the voxel based morphometry framework SPM 
Results Groups did not differ signicantly with respect age gender More males developed PDD males 
females compared those remaining intact males females Clusters lower grey matter volume were
found PDD compared PD left uncus baseline and expanded region that included the left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus months The cognitive status scan interaction showed differential
changes between groups the right insula At more liberal statistical threshold observed changes the
right insula and bilateral hippocampi well the right cuneus additional the lower brain stem 
Conclusions Region specic atrophy consistent with the pattern cortical Lewy body deposition seen autopsy
studies can detected with MRI PD patients with signicant cognitive decline MRI may useful for tracking
cognitive decline PD

Introduction
Parkinsons disease PD the most common neurodegenerative
movement disorder and characterized loss dopaminergic
nigrostriatal projections however over time more generalized pathology leads widespread neurodegeneration which leads signicant loss motor response dopamine replacement cognitive
decline and dementia The latter are the major determinants 
nursing home placement and increased mortality The neurologic
bases for these changes are not fully understood Imaging biomarkers
might assist tracking pathological changes predication dementia
and development treatments Magnetic resonance imaging may

Patients with PD with dementia PDD have progressive atrophy 
MRI that likely begins with mild cognitive impairment which occurs least patients prior signicant cognitive decline 
Recent studies show that longitudinal cortical grey matter changes
occur incident early Parkinsons disease cases 
These ndings are consistent with prior studies that suggest that subtle
changes occur prior overt cognitive decline and can detected prevalent cases Grey matter atrophy rates may depend

We have shown that whole brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement occur older patients with PD developing incident dementia 
signicant cognitive decline and might accelerated patients
with hyper homocysteinemia In the current study analyze
this same cohort for regional changes brain atrophy using state ofthe art optimized voxel based morphometry test for more focal
changes driving the previously observed whole brain atrophy and ventricular dilations We hypothesized that atrophy localized pattern

 MR imaging
Images were acquired Siemens Sonata T system between December and August weighted images were obtained
using D magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence MPRAGE TR TE TI average angle eld view FOV image matrix 
 slices slices with image slices oriented perpendicular the AC PC line Native spatial resolution was 
which was zero lled Standard axial FLAIR images TR TE averages FOV slices 
 slice thickness oriented the inferior margin the corpus

pathological lesions previously described 
 Intracranial volumes
Intracranial volumes ICV were measured from the weighted images using the program DISPLAY Montreal Neurological Institute Quebec 
Canada http www bic mni mcgill ServicesSoftwareVisualization 
HomePage previously described The intracranial volumes were
used correct the grey and white matter volumes for individual
differences 
 Voxel based morphometry
Image processing was done using the toolbox http 
dbm neuro uni jena vbm for longitudinal data running 
Matlab In toolbox the month and month volumes
were initially realigned the baseline volume then mean image
was created and the three volumes realigned again the mean
image All three volumes were then bias corrected and segmented
into GM WM and CSF Spatial normalization parameters were obtained
from the baseline image using the DARTEL Diffeomorphic Anatomical
Registration using Exponentiated Lie algebra toolbox and applied
 all three volumes The standard template images provided the
 toolbox based the average brain were used for spatial normalization The toolbox for longitudinal image processing
produces unmodulated tissue segment volumes hence changes observed represent tissue concentration and not tissue volumes 
An Gaussian smoothing kernel was applied prior statistical
analysis was used for both cross sectional and longitudinal comparisons The comparisons between PDND and PDD groups baseline
and months were modeled using two between group factors dementia status and gender To examine changes with respect time 
exible factorial model was used with dementia status and gender 
between subject factors and scan time baseline month and
 month within subject factor The interaction between dementia
classication and scan time was examined see and where the two
groups changed differently over time Baseline age and intracranial volume ICV were also included all models For cluster level inference
 cluster dening threshold uncorrected was
used with the non stationarity adjustment which accounts for differences smoothness the images The threshold cluster size that
corresponded FWE cluster level corrected value was then
used lter the results Only signicant clusters are displayed the
gures Additionally test for more focal but stronger effects voxelwise family wise error FWE corrected value was applied 
Results

Among the earlier longitudinal studies one showed increased rate
 atrophy PDD with difference the rate atrophy between cognitively intact PD patients and controls contrasting with another
study that found atrophy both PD and PDD using VBM PD patients with hallucinations who are risk for dementia have been
shown have focal atrophy Longitudinal volumetric scans with
patients grouped according smell abnormalities another potential
risk factor for dementia rather than cognitive decline showed
that group with normal olfaction showed progressive changes the
right amygdala and bilateral temporal lobes Recent studies suggest
that progressive cortical thinning likely accelerated patients with
mild cognitive impairment and may associated with incident
MCI In addition areas show involved progressive
changes can seen more widespread cortical areas including the
temporal parietal and frontal lobes and deep structures such the
thalamus and basal ganglia Differences between studies are likely
based imaging methods and characteristic the subjects Our
study highlights the utility brain MRI track cognitive decline 
typical treated patient population agreement with Melzer 
A weakness our study includes its relatively small sample size with
only incident signicant cognitive decline dementia subjects On the
other hand strength the systematic longitudinal follow We did
not use currently proposed PD dementia criteria which are still being validated since they were not available the time study inception 
rather used modied DSM IV criteria not requiring memory impairment Our grouping likely clinically meaningful however given the
fact that cognitive decline correlated strongly with atrophy our previous study and that functional decline related cognitive impairment
was evident our subjects It should acknowledged that the pathological contributions cognitive decline Parkinsons disease may

The use cluster level inference limits the ability precise about
the affected regions the brain In our case for example were
able specify particular region the right insula where GM atrophy
 accelerated PDD compared PDND using peak level inference 
When used cluster level inference larger cluster the right
insula well clusters the hippocampi and brain stem are revealed however cannot specify where within these structures
these changes are occurring We identied cluster the
brainstem that showed atrophy consistent with previous study potentially consistent with pathological progression hypothesized
 Braak 
Our study examined subjects who are high risk for dementia 
 virtue age and examined incident signicant cognitive decline
and dementia This suggests that MRI imaging can used track
the onset meaningful decline There some evidence that atrophy
may reversible with interventions such mindfulness therapy
 suggesting that MRI may useful biomarker intervention studies The correspondence the areas change with pathologic data gives support the notion that the ndings are
biologically meaningful Clearly future studies should follow patients
 autopsy see there correspondence between imaging ndings and autopsy ndings Our data add further support the notion
that MRI detects meaningful changes which can complement other
biomarkers predicting and tracking cognitive decline Lewy
