Article abstract Magnetic resonance imaging based volumetric measurements medial temporal lobe MTL

moderate advanced severity In terms clinical utility however more important issue concerns the ability the
technique differentiate between normal elderly control subjects and AD patients with the very mildest form the
disease We performed MRI based volumetric measurements the hippocampus parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala
 cognitively normal elderly control subjects and patients with probable AD The diagnosis AD was made
according NINDS ADRDA criteria and disease severity was categorized Clinical Dementia Rating CDR scores 
Patients with CDR were classified very mild CDR mild and CDR moderate disease severity Volumes 
each structure declined with increasing age control subjects and did parallel for men and women The volume 
each measured MTL structure also declined with age patients with AD The volume each MTL structure was
significantly smaller AD patients than control subjects Of the several MTL measures the total hippocampal volumetric measurements were best discriminating control subjects from AD patients The mean hippocampal

variables that appeared the final model were hippocampal volume hippocampal volume squared and age Although all these terms were significant the level
