Background Magnetic resonance imaging MRI hippocampal atrophy sensitive but not specific method 
support the clinical diagnosis early Alzheimers disease
 AD We recently described our findings that atrophy 
the entorhinal cortex ERC frontotemporal dementia
 FTD equal that found AD but that hippocampal
atrophy FTD less than that found AD The MRI
volumes these structures provide topographic representation the region interest We hypothesized that
two different dementias with distinct histopathologic and
clinical features might addition quantitative patterns display topographically different patterns 
atrophy 
Methods We adopted morphometric approach monitor the pattern atrophy the hippocampus and the
ERC computing two dimensional profiles from MRI
volumes the structures control subjects and patients
with FTD and AD 
Results Compared with control subjects atrophy the
hippocampus patients with AD was diffuse In patients
with FTD atrophy the hippocampus was localized
predominantly the anterior hippocampus suggesting 
different pattern hippocampal atrophy FTD compared with AD The amount and pattern atrophy the
entorhinal cortex was virtually equal both demented
groups 
Conclusions This study provides novel data the nature

Introduction
A
lzheimers disease AD has distinctive regional predilection and hierarchical topographic distribution 
histopathologic changes within the medial temporal lobe
 MTL specifically the entorhinal cortex ERC and
the hippocampus Braak and Braak Gomez Isla 
 Hyman Although pathology the MTL
 AD well documented data hippocampal atrophy
 frontotemporal dementia FTD much less consistent 
FTD constitutes heterogenic disorder not spectrum
 disorders affecting mainly frontal and anterior temporal
cortices and often lacking distinctive histopathologic
markers found other types dementia Brun 
 With regard the MTL histopathologic studies 
the hippocampus FTD have shown the involvement 
the hippocampus range from severe Knopman 
 through modest varying Bergmann 
Nagaoka minor involvement Brun
 Filley Kinoshita Fewer data
are available about the ERC 
The pathology AD the MTL leads atrophy the
MTL structures and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging MRI hippocampal atrophy well established
tool support the clinical diagnosis early AD Jack 
 Laakso The atrophy may lack AD
specificity however We recently have shown that FTD 
ERC atrophy equal that found AD but hippocampal atrophy less FTD than AD Frisoni 
 The purpose our article study whether
different regions interest ROIs with quantitatively
different volume loss would also display topographically
distinct patterns volume loss Indeed there 
increased interest morphometric brain mapping study

In this study adopted morphometric approach 
assess the atrophy the hippocampus and the ERC 
FTD compared with patients with AD and control subjects This was done computing two dimensional D 
sagittal average profiles the ROIs each group 
describe possible differences the patterns atrophy 
functionally distinct antero posterior axis the structures 
This approach based the assumption that structure
and function the brain are not independent but that they
interact Hence the shape given structure may also
reflect the integrity the tissue Van Essen We
thus hypothesized that two different dementias with distinct pathologies clinical manifestations and different
amounts MTL damage might display different patterns

Methods and Materials
Subjects and Clinical Assessment
Subjects this study have been described previously more

 additional FTD patient the study protocol and characteristics
are presented briefly The study population consisted 
subjects whom were patients with mild moderate AD
 mean age years female subjects male subjects 
patients with FTD mean age years female subjects 
males subjects and were control subjects mean age 
 female subjects male subjects Table Routine dementia assessment the Alzheimers unit Brescia Italy was carried
out all the participants This included clinical and neurologic
examination comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation including Mini Mental State Examination MMSE and Clinical
Dementia Rating CDR laboratory studies including complete
blood count and folic acid thyroid function and chemistry

MRI Protocol and Analysis
MRI was performed the Department Radiology University
 Verona Italy with Tesla scanner Siemens Magnetom 
Erlangen Germany using standard head coil and weighted magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo
 TR msec TE msec TI msec flip angle field 
view acquisition matrix resulting 
sagittal images 
Volumetric measurements and analyses were made the
Kuopio University Hospital Finland The scans were reconstructed coronally oriented perpendicular the intercommissural line The ROIs were manually traced from contiguous
 thick images single tracer blinded the subjects
clinical data using custom made software for standard Siemens work console The anatomical starting point was the
rostral end the hippocampus when first appears below the
amygdala The tracing the hippocampus ended posteriorly 
the section where the crura the fornices depart from the lateral
wall the lateral ventricles Frisoni Laakso 
 The ERC volumes were traced according the recent
criteria Insausti In brief the most anterior slice
measured was the one after the appearance temporal stem and
the last slice was the one where the uncus and gyrus intralimbicus were longer separable 
Once the ROI has been traced the software calculates the
volume for every structure computing the number 
voxels for each traced image After the tracing complete the
software also displays the sagittal lateral profile the measured structure for each subject This profile formed from each
measured slice area displayed the axis and the length
 number slices the axis The group profiles were
calculated averaging the profiles for each subject from each 
the three groups Because the slightly different number 
slices between individuals the volume profile was computed 
linear interpolation between separate slices for relative length
 and the subvolumes were computed for intervals
 the number ROIs for each subject was transformed 
for each subject This was done using customized macros
written for the statistical software for every given number 
slices The atrophy regions within the ERC and the hippocampus was explored subdividing the ROIs into three subregions
along their antero posterior axis anterior medial
 and posterior subregions 
The intraclass correlation coefficient the intrarater variabil 
ity was for the hippocampus volumes and for the ERC 
The coronal intracranial area the level the anterior commissure was used for normalization the volumetric data Frisoni 
 Laakso For data presentation purposes the
volumes reported here are normalized the intracranial area
according the following formula volume intracranial area 
Statistics
One way analysis variance ANOVA with the Duncan post
hoc analysis was used compare the means between study
groups Differences proportions were assessed with chi square
test The relationship volumes with gender and age was
assessed with multivariate ANOVA with the hippocampal and
ERC volumes dependent variables and gender and age age
less than and years older factors The results are

Results
The age difference between the FTD group the AD group 
and the control group was significant F 
with the FTD group being younger and differing from both
the AD and control groups the post hoc analysis There
were more male patients among the FTD group were than
among either the AD and control groups 
 The groups did not differ with regard education 
As expected both the AD group and the FTD group
performed significantly worse the MMSE F 
 Table compared with control subjects In the
post hoc analysis the FTD patients scored significantly
worse than the AD patients the MMSE By
contrast the distribution the CDR scale indicated less
severe global dementia the FTD patients although the
finding was not statistically significant Memory disturbances and disorientation onset were more frequent 
the AD group whereas both behavioral oral and dietary
changes and language disturbances dominated the clinical
picture the FTD patients data not presented Disease
duration did not differ significantly between the demented
groups months FTD months 
AD The frequency subjects carrying the allele 
the FTD group was lower than that the AD group
 and equal that the control group 
The relationship between the hippocampal and ERC
volumes with age the control group was assessed with
correlation and locally weighted regression analyses data
not shown Neither method found any association between the hippocampal and ERC volumes with age 
Furthermore the relationship volumes with gender and
age was assessed with multivariate ANOVA with the
hippocampal and ERC volumes dependent variables

The question about the pathology underlying the observed finding intriguing In AD the pathology the
hippocampus entorhinal complex well established
 Braak and Braak Hyman whereas the
neuroanatomical neuropathological substrates for the
current finding FTD require further exploration Although neuropathological data FTDs with regard the
hippocampus have suggested various patterns atrophy 
several studies seem support the view for lesser damage 
ranging from minor involvement involvement Bergmann Brun Filley Kinoshita
 Nagaoka There are fewer data 
the ERC involvement FTD There however some
data support these findings In recent study spheroidical enlargements presynaptic terminals suggestive

Discussion
In this study used volumetric MRI form D
topographic models the hippocampus and the ERC 
controls subjects patients with AD and patients with
FTD Our previous quantitative finding that both the
hippocampus and ERC are atrophic both the AD and
FTD groups compared with the control group were repeated with additional FTD patient Frisoni 
In short hippocampal atrophy FTD was less severe than
 AD whereas the atrophy the ERC was equal
degree both the patient groups The approach this
paper however entirely different from the previous
study and the scope reaches beyond the quantitative
terms Judging the profiles suggest that hippocampal atrophy FTD weighted the anterior part the
hippocampus with much less atrophy evident posteriorly 
Particularly the right side the posterior subregional
volumes are identical the control and FTD groups The
ERC volumes displayed identical atrophy quantitatively

In another study chromosome linked FTD there
was damage the ERC with the hippocampus being
substantially spared except for degeneration those
regions receiving input from the perforant pathway The
finding was considered secondary entorhinal nerve cell
loss Sima 
Indeed the hippocampus has its major cortical input
from the ERC The ERC serves source excitatory
input the perforant pathway which projects the dentate
gyrus the subiculum and beyond further
internal projections This results the ventral and dorsal
parts the hippocampus selectively receiving different
kinds input Witter and Groenewegen One
possible explanation for the findings therefore that
anterior temporal pathology FTD might lead direct
involvement the ERC Alternatively there may more
extensive disruption various cortico cortical and cortico basal circuits resulting damage the ERC and 
subsequent bystander damage the hippocampus Given
the neuropathological data suggesting sparing the hip 
pocampus FTD this observed pattern atrophy may
also nonprogressive In this way FTD differs from AD 
where these regions are not only the first ones 
affected but also show progressive deterioration and are
among the most severely degenerated regions the
end stage disease Braak and Braak Hyman 
The substantial sparing the posterior part the
hippocampus FTD also implies clinical correlations 
FTD The hippocampus has not only connectional but also
functional differences along its longitudinal axis Colombo Moser Schacter and Wagner
 The posterior part the hippocampus has been
suggested subserve memory encoding Schacter and
Wagner well visuospatial memory Moser 
 Notably these functions are considered 
substantially spared FTD By contrast deficits the
more anterior parts the temporal lobe such the
amygdala might associated with the behavioral 
language disturbances prominent FTD 
Some possible caveats this study deserve consideration First age gender and disease severity were different between the patients with FTD and those with AD The
patients with AD and the control patients were significantly older than the FTD patients This however takes
place default one wants match the groups with
disease duration severity because the onset FTD 
typically younger In fact the younger age our FTD
patients may favor correct diagnosis true FTD because
frontal lobe syndromes the very elderly are common 
but only minority actually has primary FTD Gislason 
 Although the MMSE was indicative greater
severity the FTD group the other indicators such 
duration CDR and basic and instrumental disability 
pointed toward difference slightly greater severity 
the AD group Indeed because the MMSE highly
dependent the integrity language function Goldblum may not serve good instrument for
measurement global severity conditions such FTD 
 which language disturbances are particularly dominant 
With regard age neither the hippocampal ERC
volumes were correlated with age the group control
subjects this other larger studies our group
 Insausti Laakso others DeCarli
 Sullivan In agreement with
previous studies the hippocampal and the ERC volumes
did not differ between control men and women after

rare focal AD presenting with behavioral and language
disturbances and sparing memory early the course 
disease Jagust Nonetheless SPECT perfusion
patterns not indicate any marked heterogeneity FTD
 this material that all patients with FTD showed
marked frontal hypoperfusion SPECT scans Frisoni 
 Moreover the neuropsychologic pattern also has
been studied patients with FTD and found 
expected from study the literature marked disturbance
 language production with sparing nonverbal learning Frisoni The absence Parkinsonism 
features motor neuron disease should also reduce
heterogeneity None the subjects were known have 
autosomal dominant mode inheritance and the frequency apolipoprotein E FTD did not differ from
control subjects but was significantly lower than patients with AD Geschwind 
Another conceptual factor related with anatomic and
functional division the ROIs Whereas the hippocampus
can divided three subregionsthe head the body 
and the tail which coarsely correspond the subdivisions 
the present studyno such distinction exists for the ERC 
That however may beside the point Of relevance here
 the fact that morphometry can utilized study
hippocampus and this approach may reveal distinctive
groupwise patterns between the study groups the
case this study The subdivision three regions rather
should considered means presentation the
data By using the method regional differences could 
calculated for every fifth percentile necessary 
These data provide novel insight into the pattern 
medial temporal lobe damage FTD In conclusion both
the hippocampus and ERC are atrophic AD and FTD 
The extent and pattern atrophy the ERC virtually
similar both the dementias By contrast the hippocampal atrophy FTD less severe than AD and
appears attributable atrophy located mainly the
anterior hippocampus with relative sparing the postrior
part It possible that the observed pattern hippocampal damage secondary entorhinal pathology Further 
 suggested that straightforward morphometric approach provides valuable additional information compared
with conventional quantitative MRI It appears possible
that structural imaging may identify different patterns 
atrophy and this can utilized better characterize
various primary degenerative dementias with different
underlying pathologies This approach may provide 
means find substrates different patterns structurefunction relationship functional impairment vivo
