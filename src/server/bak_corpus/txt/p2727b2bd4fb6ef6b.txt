Article abstract Hippocampal atrophy detected volumetric MRI sensitive feature early Alzheimers diueasc
 AD but there are studies evaluating hippocampal atrophy MR volumetry other dementing diseases Wc
therefore compared hippocampal volumes total subjects patients with mild moderate AD patients with
vascular dementia VaD patients with idiopathic Parkinsons disease PD without dementia patients with PD and
dementia PDD and elderly control subjects Thin coronal contiguous images were obtained T M R imager 
All patient groups had significantly smaller volumes the hippocampus compared with the control group In the PDL 
group the absolute volumes were even smaller than the AD group In the PD group the volumes were diminished 
lesser but significant extent The volumes the VaD group varied nine patients two had atrophy three had
unilateral and four had bilateral atrophy We postulate hippocampal atrophy does not seem specific
phenomenon dementia AD but also occurs VaD and PDD and even PD when dementia present However 
coexistence AD pathology our PD and VaD patients cannot ruled out Further studies with access neuropathologic data are needed 
NEUROLOGY 
In clinical practice the diagnosis Alzheimers disease AD based typical features disease
and exclusion other conditions causing dementia 
In AD the hippocampus atrophied early the
course the disease and the atrophy can reliably detected volumetric MRI for diagnostic purposes I With this technique AD patient can sensitively separated not only from cognitively normal
control subjects but also from subjects suffering
from differentially important conditions such ageassociated memory and depressive
pseudodementia However the specificity MRI
volumetry the evaluation hippocampal atrophy
 dementing diseases other than AD has not been
determined 
In the diagnostic process dementias AD and
vascular dementias VaD constitute the largest and
thus differentia Ily most important groups dementias These two types dementia together account
for much all Moreover 
one
 the most common diseases the elderly that may
 associated with dementia Parkinsons disease
 PD In PD the proportion demented patients
varies from the percentage increasing
with age 
In this study investigate the specificity ofhippocampal atrophy comparing hippocam pal volumes AD patients and cognitively normal control
subjects with volumes patients with VaD and PD
with dementia PDD and without dementia Our
working hypothesis was that the volume loss hippocampus would most pronounced AD and not
present PD 
Methods We evaluated the volumes hippocampus

hippocampus The hippocampus included the dentate gyrus the hippocampus proper and the subicular complex 
The uncal portion the hippocampus that located ventral the caudal amygdala was included into 
hippocampus The caudal end the hippocampus was determined from the section which the fornices were still
detectable their full length The fornices were not however included the volume the hippocampus The
boundaries the hippocampus were outlined tractball driven cursor and the number voxels within the
region creating the volume was calculated using 
 house developed program To exclude individual size
variability the volumes were normalized coronal intracranial area measured the level anterior commissure
 the volumes were multiplied and divided intracranial area All measurements were performed the
same rater without any knowledge the clinical data and
diagnostic category the subjects The methodology and
reproducibility the method have been described detail

Statistical analysis The data were analyzed SPSSPC V software SPSS Inc Chicago IL ANOVA
with Duncan post hoc analysis was used compare the

Results 
The clinical data study groups are presented table ANOVA showed significant difference

older than AD and PD patients Duncan Duration dementia did not differ the demented patient
groups Duration PD was slightly longer the PDD
group than the PD group but not significantly As expected the MMSE scores differed significantly 
 across the study groups the control and
PD groups had higher scores AD VaD and PDD
patients and VaD group had lower scores
 the AD and PDD groups The ischemic
scores also differed significantly ANOVA the
VaD and PDD groups had higher scores than AD PD and
control groups However none the PDD patients received ischemic score higher than The Webster scores were significantly higher PD and PDD than

atrophy could not explained other findings the

The correlations between hippocampal volumes 
performance memory test scores were significant AD
and PDD groups but not VaD PD control groups 
The left hippocampal volume correlated with delayed story
recall AD and with immediate list learning scores PDD 
Discussion A noninvasive method for the diagnosis early AD urgently needed Hippocampal
volumetry using MRI has shown potential promising and sensitive method for diagnosing early
but this study indicates that hippocampal atrophy not specific finding AD also occurs 
VaD and PDD well lesser degree PD
without dement Thus hippocampal atrophy may
 common phenomenon some dementias and
not restricted only AD Atrophy the hippocampus also occurs amnestic conditions temporal
lobe pathology The volume hippocampus correlates with memory functions measured tests
assessing delayed that are sensitive dementia and spared ageing JIn this study left

hippocampal volumes correlated with verbal memory
scores AD and PDD although the number PDD
patients was small In VaD PD control subjects 
there were significant correlations between memory scores and hippocampal volumes Yet classical
dementia PD not regarded temporal but 
subcortical In addition vascular lesions should not
necessarily affect the temporal lobe 
The dementia occurring PD not single concept but consists variety dementia syndromes 
 which the clinical picture depends separate
pathogenetic mechanisms different neurotransmitter systems The typical dementia PD mild
subcortical dementia resulting from dopaminergic insufficiency The most severe type disease PDD
combined with AD pathology which present 
 the patients with PD Moreover AD and
PD share some neurochemical abnormalities the
brain such deficits the cholinergic serotonergic 
noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems In AD 
the disturbances the medial temporal lobe structures the hippocampus entorhinal cortex and adjacent cortical regions are central phenomenon 
Neurofibrillary tangles are present the entorhinal
region PD and AD 
The entorhinal cortex 
major relay station between the hippocampus and
the isocortex and its bilateral destruction isolates
the hippocampus from isocortical inputs Thus the
hippocampal atrophy our PD and PDD patients
may explained the neuropathologw changes
resulting from PD its own coexisterice PD
and AD particularly PDD patients 
The patterns atrophy the VaD group are
more difficult explain In previous study with
aged rats chronic vascular insufficiency without infarctions mimicked AD type changes including high
signal intensities the hippocampal region predominant the right side MR spectroscopic changes 
alterations local cerebral blood flow spatial memory dysfunction and neuron damage Yet this

does not explain our findings where the nine VaD
patients four had bilateral atrophy two had atrophy and three had unilateral atrophy In three 
the four patients with unilateral atrophy the right
hippocampus was larger Other findings T weighted axial MRI could not clarify the nature 
these findings There were large strategic infarcts other lesions the temporal lobes the
area the posterior cerebral artery responsible for
the circulation the hippocampus However these
patterns atrophy probably represent the results 
different vascular lesions etiologies In the two
VaD patients without atrophy the lesions causing
the dementia probably did not affect the size hippocampus Likewise cases with unilateral atrophy the lesions affect the hippocampus only one
side The cases with bilateral atrophy have vascular
lesions affecting the hippocampus bilaterally alternatively they may present mixed dementia that
 the combination AD and VaD In previous
autopsy study the presence mixed dementia was
surprisingly high three four patients considered
 have VaD had also AD and patients considered have mixed dementia had AD alone 
We conclude that hippocampal atrophy sensitive feature AD but specificity this atrophy
seems limit its use clinical practice
