ABSTRACT
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE
An effort define and validate Harmonized Protocol for standard hippocampal segmentation being carried out We wished
 estimate the effect magnetic resonance image MRI spatial orientation manual hippocampal segmentations define
optimal standard orientation MRIs for hippocampal volumetry 
METHODS
Three expert tracers segmented twice the hippocampi ADNI subjects MRI slices oriented perpendicular the anteriorposterior commissure AC PC line and the long hippocampal axes plane following internationally harmonized landmarks We
computed intra and interrater reliability figures for total volumes and similarity coefficients 
RESULTS
Total volume reliability was similar for both orientations Similarity coefficients were significantly higher for the AC PC orientation
 exact P 
DISCUSSION
These data show that AC PC orientation slightly more reliable for manual segmentations possibly due better visualization
 the cerebrospinal fluid spaces separating hippocampal head and amygdala A Delphi panel experts has used these data 
decide the optimal orientation for Harmonized Protocol for hippocampal segmentation

for image preprocessing able reorient the images perpendicular the AC PC line The disadvantage greater partial

human effort required the automated preprocessing phase 
In the context the Harmonized Protocol Project which
aims establish international protocol for manual segmentation the hippocampus our objective was assess differences
 measurement reliability for manual segmentations along either the AC PC hippocampal axes order allow Delphi
panel experts take evidence based decisions for the definition the optimal MRI orientation 
Methods
We recruited three expert tracers based both expertise and
balanced bias for specific orientation LA with greater practice

Statistics
We estimated volume intrarater reliability computing intraclass correlation coefficients ICCs between segmentations 
the AC PC and hippocampal axes and computing interrater reliability separately for AC PC and hippocampal axesoriented images We computed these interrater ICCs according
 two ways random effects model with both images and tracers random factors Since the aim was measure how far
from identical scores were raters and methods orientation 
the most restrictive type absolute agreement ICC was used
instead simple consistency The statistical analysis was conducted using SPSS 
We computed the spatial overlapping among three tracers
with the formula

Discussion
Hippocampal segmentations based harmonized landmarks 
carried out three expert tracers from independent centres 
AC PC and hippocampal axes oriented scans were all characterized very high volume ICCs but detected significantly
higher spatial overlap for segmentations completed the
AC PC oriented scans 
We examined individually hippocampal contours produced
 the three tracers order detect possible causes that could
account for this difference The largest differences among tracers occurring especially the hippocampal axes orientation 
could attributed the segmentation the head the level
 the boundary with the amygdala The comparison through
D navigation the boundary area between the hippocampus and the amygdala scans oriented the AC PC and 
hippocampal axes enables appreciation more informative
details the former consisting better visualization cerebrospinal fluid CSF spaces more clearly separating the two
structures than the visualization the hippocampal axes
Minor regions heterogeneity between tracers were identified the tail end These were equally observed the AC PC
and the hippocampal axes oriented images see examples

indicate higher concordance the referred orientation 
Although the AC PC orientation seemed provide more
detailed information for correct and reliable separation the
hippocampus from adjacent structures and particularly from
the amygdala from our image analysis cannot exclude that
the wider practice examining brain structures the standard
AC PC oriented images the brain they are reported any
atlas may also have influenced the tracers performance This 
 turn consistent with the convenience setting standard operating procedures facilitate reliability measurements and
 being consistent with other available standard procedures

Volumetric ICCs were very high although tracers came
from different centers We believe that this reliability may

 www hippocampal protocol net 
We did not compute proper intrarater values separately for
the AC PC and the hippocampal axes orientations but only
 proxy considering segmentations carried out the two
orientations the same images Although separate intraraters
for the two orientations would have been preferable possible that ceiling effect these very experienced tracers would
have hidden difference due orientation while interrater values are more liable the effect confounders like orientation 
This especially plausible considering that used the absolute method for ICCs computations which more restrictive
than the most common consistency method 
We are not aware previous studies trying quantify the
differences reliability hippocampal segmentation images oriented along different axes The need carry out this
kind investigation arose from the need define Harmonized Protocol for hippocampal segmentation set standardized operating procedure the use hippocampal volumetry
 biomarker for AD 
As the next step this project the quantitative data described here were used inform the Delphi panel 
 decide the optimal orientation MRIs for Harmonized Protocol for hippocampal segmentation Indeed based
 the described data the Delphi panel achieved significant
agreement for the AC PC orientation This decision that will

the current standard orientation the brain different settings from neuropathology atlas representations Moreover 
the sources heterogeneity segmentations observed this
phase have been used further improve landmarks descriptions and instructions that were defined the Harmonized
