In patients with FTD, atrophy of the hippocampus was localized predominantly in the anterior hippocampus, suggesting a different pattern of hippocampal atrophy in FTD compared with AD. The amount and pattern of atrophy of the entorhinal cortex was virtually equal in both demented groups.

Results The age difference between the FTD group, the AD group, and the control group was significant, with the FTD group being younger and differing from both the AD and control groups in the post hoc analysis.

In the post hoc analysis, the FTD patients scored significantly worse than the AD patients on the MMSE. By contrast, the distribution on the CDR scale indicated less severe global dementia in the FTD patients, although the finding was not statistically significant.

In the posterior subregion, the patients with FTD differed significantly from the control group, and the patients with AD differed significantly from both the control subjects and the patients with FTD. 1060 M.P.

The question about the pathology underlying the observed finding is intriguing.

The substantial sparing of the posterior part of the hippocampus in FTD also implies clinical correlations in FTD. The hippocampus has not only connectional but also functional differences along its longitudinal axis.

First, age, gender, and disease severity were different between the patients with FTD and those with AD. The patients with AD and the control patients were significantly older than the FTD patients.

The younger age of our FTD patients may favor correct diagnosis of true FTD because frontal lobe syndromes in the very elderly are common, but only a minority actually has primary FTD. Although the MMSE was indicative of greater severity in the FTD group, the other indicators pointed toward no difference or slightly greater severity in the AD group.
