In terms of clinical utility, however, a more important issue concerns the ability of the technique to differentiate between normal elderly control subjects and AD patients with the very mildest form of the disease. We performed MRI-based volumetric measurements of the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala in 126 cognitively normal elderly control subjects and 94 patients with probable AD. The diagnosis of AD was made according to NINDS/ADRDA criteria, and disease severity was categorized by Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores. Patients with CDR 0.5 were classified as very mild, CDR 1 as mild, and CDR 2 as moderate disease severity. Volumes of each structure declined with increasing age in control subjects and did so in parallel for men and women. The volume of each measured MTL structure also declined with age in patients with AD. The volume of each MTL structure was significantly smaller in AD patients than control subjects (p < 0.001). Of the several MTL measures, the total hippocampal volumetric measurements were best at discriminating control subjects from AD patients. The mean hippocampal volumes for AD patients relative to control subjects by severity of disease were as follows: very mild AD (CDR 0.5) -1.75 SD below the control mean, mild AD (CDR 1) -1.99 SD, and moderate AD (CDR 2) -2.22 SD. Age- and gender-adjusted, normalized MRI-based hippocampal volumetric measurements provide a sensitive marker of the MTL neuroanatomic degeneration in AD early in the disease process.","value":15},{"authors":[{"name":"R.

However, the influence of AET on their motor learning capacities, as well as the change in neural substrates mediating this effect remains to be explored.\n\nOBJECTIVE:\nIn the current study, we employed functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to assess the effect of a 3-month AET program on the neural correlates of implicit motor sequence learning (MSL).\n\nMETHODS:\n20 healthy controls (HC) and 19 early PD individuals participated in a supervised, high-intensity, stationary recumbent bike training program (3 times/week for 12 weeks). Exercise prescription started at 20 min (+ 5 min/week up to 40 min) based on participant's maximal aerobic power. Before and after the AET program, participants' brain was scanned while performing an implicit version of the serial reaction time task.\n\nRESULTS:\nBrain data revealed pre-post MSL-related increases in functional activity in the hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum in PD patients, as well as in the striatum in HC individuals. Importantly, the functional brain changes in PD individuals correlated with changes in aerobic fitness: a positive relationship was found with increased activity in the hippocampus and striatum, while a negative relationship was observed with the cerebellar activity.\n\nCONCLUSION:\nOur results reveal, for the first time, that exercise training produces functional changes in known motor learning related brain structures that are consistent with improved behavioural performance observed in PD patients. As such, AET can be a valuable non-pharmacological intervention to promote, not only physical fitness in early PD, but also better motor learning capacity useful in day-to-day activities through increased plasticity in motor related structures.","value":7},{"authors":[{"name":"Myrlene Gee"},{"name":"Juergen Dukart"},{"name":"Bogdan Draganski"},{"name":"W.

We also examined 15 pain-free healthy participants of similar age, gender, and cognitive state as a control group. We assessed pain by the King's Parkinson's Pain Scale, the Visual Analogue Scale for pain, and the Leeds Assessment for Neuropathic Symptoms and Sign. All patients underwent structural, diffusion tensor imaging, and resting-state functional MRI. We compared clinical characteristics, whole-brain cortical thickness, subcortical volumes, diffusion tensor imaging scalar measures, and functional connectivity by network based statistics.\nRESULTS:\nThe group with PD and persistent pain showed significant thinning in the bilateral temporal pole, left-medial orbitofrontal cortex, bilateral superior and left-inferior parietal areas, pars orbicularis, and right superior frontal, posterior cingulated, and precentral cortex. There were no significant subcortical volume and white matter differences between PD subgroups. Functional MRI showed a decrease of brain activity in the left frontal inferior orbital in PD patients with persistent pain, with greater activity bilaterally in the cerebellum and in the right inferior temporal areas. Only PD patients with persistent pain showed an accumbens-hippocampus disconnection without white matter and subcortical alterations.\nCONCLUSIONS:\nWe showed that persistent pain in PD is associated with supraspinal structural and functional changes.

Currently, with the exception of individuals with genetic mutations, postmortem examination of brain tissue remains the only definitive means of establishing diagnosis in most cases, however, structural neuroimaging, in combination with clinical assessment, has value in improving diagnostic accuracy during life. Beyond the exclusion of surgical pathology, signal change and cerebral atrophy visible on structural MRI can be used to identify diagnostically relevant imaging features, which provide support for clinical diagnosis of neurodegenerative dementias. While no structural imaging feature has perfect sensitivity and specificity for a given diagnosis, there are a number of imaging characteristics which provide positive predictive value and help to narrow the differential diagnosis. While neuroradiological expertise is invaluable in accurate scan interpretation, there is much that a non-radiologist can gain from a focused and structured approach to scan analysis.

For example, DTI may be used for the diagnosis and differentiation of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus (iNPH) from other neurodegenerative diseases with similar imaging findings and clinical symptoms and signs. The goal of the current study was to identify and analyze recently published series on the use of DTI as a diagnostic tool. Moreover, the authors also explored the utility of DTI in identifying patients with iNPH who could be managed by surgical intervention. METHODS The authors performed a literature search of the PubMed database by using any possible combinations of the following terms: 'Alzheimer's disease,' 'brain,' 'cerebrospinal fluid,' 'CSF,' 'diffusion tensor imaging,' 'DTI,' 'hydrocephalus,' 'idiopathic,' 'magnetic resonance imaging,' 'normal pressure,' 'Parkinson's disease,' and 'shunting.' Moreover, all reference lists from the retrieved articles were reviewed to identify any additional pertinent articles. RESULTS The literature search retrieved 19 studies in which DTI was used for the identification and differentiation of iNPH from other neurodegenerative diseases. The DTI protocols involved different approaches, such as region of interest (ROI) methods, tract-based spatial statistics, voxel-based analysis, and delta-ADC analysis. The most studied anatomical regions were the periventricular WM areas, such as the internal capsule (IC), the corticospinal tract (CST), and the corpus callosum (CC). Patients with iNPH had significantly higher MD in the periventricular WM areas of the CST and the CC than had healthy controls. In addition, FA and ADCs were significantly higher in the CST of iNPH patients than in any other patients with other neurodegenerative diseases. Gait abnormalities of iNPH patients were statistically significantly and negatively correlated with FA in the CST and the minor forceps. Fractional anisotropy had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 80% for diagnosing iNPH. Furthermore, FA and MD values in the CST, the IC, the anterior thalamic region, the fornix, and the hippocampus regions could help differentiate iNPH from Alzheimer or Parkinson disease. Interestingly, CSF drainage or ventriculoperitoneal shunting significantly modified FA and ADCs in iNPH patients whose condition clinically responded to these maneuvers. CONCLUSIONS Measurements of FA and MD significantly contribute to the detection of axonal loss and gliosis in the periventricular WM areas in patients with iNPH. Diffusion tensor imaging may also represent a valuable noninvasive method for differentiating iNPH from other neurodegenerative diseases. Moreover, DTI can detect dynamic changes in the WM tracts after lumbar drainage or shunting procedures and could help identify iNPH patients who may benefit from surgical intervention.","value":31},{"authors":[{"name":"Richard Camicioli"},{"name":"M.

We computed individual subject expression values for ADRP and PDCP in 89 patients with PD and correlated summary scores for cognitive functioning with network expression. We also evaluated changes in ADRP and PDCP expression in a separate group of 15 patients with PD scanned serially over a 4-year period.\n\nRESULTS:\nAnalysis revealed a significant AD-related metabolic topography characterized by covarying metabolic reductions in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and parietal and temporal association regions. Expression of ADRP, but not PDCP, was elevated in both AD groups and correlated with worse cognitive summary scores.

We used proton MR spectroscopic imaging (1H MRSI) and tissue segmented and volumetric MR images to measure atrophy-corrected hippocampal NAA and volumes in 12 AD patients (mild to moderate severity) and 17 control subjects of comparable age. In AD, atrophy-corrected NAA from the hippocampal region was reduced by 15.5% on the right and 16.2% on the left (both p < 0.003), and hippocampal volumes were smaller by 20.1% (p < 0.003) on the right and 21.8% (p < 0.001) on the left when compared with control subjects.

According to the new guidelines Alzheimer's disease (AD) involves not only dementia's phase but also predementia phase which is asymptomatic and pathological process in the brain is already present. For this reason it is very important to determine the suitability of markers which should be positive before onset of the first symptoms. One of these biomarkers is a structural magnetic resonance imaging with hippocampal volumetric assessment.\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of structural brain magnetic resonance imaging with volumetric assessment of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal gyri: superior, medial and inferior, to predict the conversion of MCI to AD.\n\nMaterial and methods\nMagnetic resonance imaging of brain was performed at the baseline visit in 101 patients diagnosed with MCI. Clinic follow-ups were scheduled after 6.12 and 24 months.\n\nResults\nAmongst 101 patients with MCI, 17 (16.8%) converted into AD within two years of observation. All measured volumes were lower in converters than non-converters. Discriminant analysis was conducted and sensitivity for MCI conversion to AD was 64.7%, specificity 96.4%. 91% of patients were correctly classified (converter or non-converter).\n\nConclusions\nVolumetric measurements may help clinicians to predict MCI conversion to AD but due to low sensitivity it cannot be use separately. The study group requires further observation.","value":26},{"authors":[{"name":"Young-Do Kim"},{"name":"Hyeonseok S.

This study aimed to assess alterations in regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) in depressed PD patients using 99mTc hexamethyl-propylene-amine-oxime single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).\nMETHODS:\nAmong 78 patients with PD, 35 patients were classified into the depressed PD group, while the rest (43 patients) was assigned to the nondepressed PD group based on the scores of the Geriatric Depressive Scale (GDS). All participants underwent brain SPECT imaging. The voxel-wise whole-brain analysis and region-of-interest (ROI) analysis of the limbic areas were conducted to compare rCBF between the depressed and nondepressed PD groups.\nRESULTS:\nThe depressed PD patients demonstrated higher GDS scores than nondepressed patients, whereas between-group differences in the PD severity and cognitive function were not significant. Perfusion in the left cuneus was increased, while that in the right superior temporal gyrus and right medial orbitofrontal cortex was reduced in the depressed PD patients as compared with nondepressed PD patients. In addition, the ROI analysis demonstrated rCBF decreases in the amygdala, anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus, and parahippocampal gyrus in the depressed PD group. A positive correlation was found between the GDS scores and rCBF in the left cuneus cluster in the depressed PD patients.\nCONCLUSION:\nThis study identified the regional pattern of brain perfusion that distinguished depressed from nondepressed PD patients. Hyperperfusion in the occipital areas and hypoperfusion in the fronto-temporo-limbic regions may be potential imaging biomarkers for depression in PD."},{"authors":[{"name":"Liana G.

Patients with MCI-c had 9% smaller left and 13% smaller right mean hippocampal volumes compared with MCI-nc patients. Radial atrophy maps showed greater atrophy of the CA1 subregion in MCI-c. Patients with MCI-c had significantly smaller hippocampi than MCI-i patients (left, 24%; right, 27%). Volumetric analyses showed a trend for greater hippocampal atrophy in MCI-nc relative to MCI-i patients (eg, 16% volume loss). After permutation tests corrected for multiple comparison, the atrophy maps showed a significant difference on the right. Subicular differences were seen between MCI-c and MCI-i patients, and MCI-nc and MCI-i patients. Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed the group effect to be highly significant and independent of age, hemisphere, and Mini-Mental State Examination scores at baseline.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\nSmaller hippocampi and specifically CA1 and subicular involvement are associated with increased risk for conversion from MCI to AD. Patients with MCI-i tend to have larger hippocampal volumes and relative preservation of both the subiculum and CA1.","value":1},{"authors":[{"name":"Feng Shi"},{"name":"Bing Liu"},{"name":"Yuan Zhou"},{"name":"Chunshui Yu"},{"name":"Tianzi Jiang"}],"cluster":2,"date":"2009/11/01","id":"p25066a75ce048c92","similarity_values":[0.522356575853101,0.43952690593671895,0.2570050349481236,0.17128952561822225,0.31727721151039306,0.10591442568347055,0.27459915738414437,0.23252603020469342,0.5419016756620063,0.2616571757344992,0.23741878223937937,0.5051336529423842,0.29751262959051045,0.35277536967073564,0.47210143085066336,0.3504547695194116,0.5428391572114131,0.5198147857938937,0.15667294217390457,0.23971575628695954,0.4431051765914548,0.23809193854799318,0.42541486614562857,1.000000000000002,0.18496459526753778,0.3209626316472822,0.061141596726683435,0.6078938350201805,0.5271109095111083,0.42440508780643643,0.5421664651856289,0.22770466039007653,0.42580460167292145],"title":"Hippocampal Volume and Asymmetry in Mild Cognitive Impairment and Alzheimer's Disease: Meta-Analyses of MRI Studies","abstract":"Numerous studies have reported a smaller hippocampal volume in Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients than in aging controls.

From 14 studies including 365 MCI patients and 382 controls, significant atrophy is found in both the left [Effect size (ES), 0.92; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.72-1.11] and right (ES, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.57-0.98) hippocampus, which is lower than that in AD (ES, 1.60, 95% CI, 1.37-1.84, in left; ES, 1.52, 95% CI, 1.31-1.72, in right). Comparing with aging controls, the average volume reduction weighted by sample size is 12.9% and 11.1% in left and right hippocampus in MCI, and 24.2% and 23.1% in left and right hippocampus in AD, respectively. The findings show a bilateral hippocampal volume loss in MCI and the extent of atrophy is less than that in AD.

The possibility of disease-modifying strategies has evoked a need for early and accurate diagnosis.

The patient was a 59-year old woman presenting with progressive memory decline. CSF-Aβ42 was normal while P-tau was slightly increased. FDG-PET indicated a pattern typical for AD, amyloid-PET showed an extensive global amyloid load, and tau-PET depicted a pronounced hippocampal tracer accumulation. The MRI scan was rated as normal at routine diagnostics, however quantitative volumetric analysis revealed significant atrophy especially of the parietal lobe. The combination of biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques was therefore suggestive of an underlying AD pathology.\n\nConclusions\nTo enable early and accurate diagnosis of AD and thereby also patient recruitment for anti-tau or anti-β-amyloid therapeutic trials, a combination of biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques seems useful."},{"authors":[{"name":"Kazuki Nakajima"},{"name":"Hisako Akiyama"},{"name":"Kaori Tanaka"},{"name":"Ayako Kohyama-Koganeya"},{"name":"Peter Greimel"},{"name":"Yoshio Hirabayashi"}],"cluster":3,"date":"2016/09/15","id":"pc00b3c65b5287be0","similarity_values":[0.06137139644795184,0.061517209603108275,0.07249863434620181,0.0695243704944216,0.07949682445409101,0.03015942745801712,0.07216593242889341,0.05635102594344213,0.05673265190000508,0.05870448726344456,0.05136664032171612,0.06381973782035005,0.06765049468225115,0.07267594996850987,0.04769149637598863,0.050937968438177994,0.09538053135222954,0.07162883308702254,0.0451757023611726,0.07432346213762248,0.06941412560559221,0.061719484889227176,0.056423102549312466,0.061141596726683435,0.06835534586237516,0.06931890546898922,0.9999999999999996,0.059305578762023095,0.06852122951856206,0.05856814253231492,0.0712303549310259,0.09820181126509785,0.0712001289174435],"title":"Separation and analysis of mono-glucosylated lipids in brain and skin by hydrophilic interaction chromatography based on carbohydrate and lipid moiety","abstract":"Mono-glycosylated sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids play important roles in diverse biological processes and are linked to a variety of pathologies, such as Parkinson disease. The precise identification of the carbohydrate head group of these lipids is complicated by their isobaric nature and by substantial differences in concentration in different biological samples. To overcome these obstacles, we developed a zwitterionic (ZIC)-hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry method. ZIC-HILIC preferentially retains inositol, followed by glucose- and galactose-featuring lipids. Comparison with unmodified silica gel HILIC stationary phase revealed different retention specificity. To evaluate the precision of ZIC-HILIC, we quantified glucosyl- (GlcCer) and galactosylceramides (GalCer) in seven different regions of the mouse brain and discovered that GlcCer and GalCer concentrations are inversely related. The highest GalCer (lowest GlcCer) content was found in the medulla oblongata and hippocampus, whereas the highest GlcCer (lowest GalCer) content was found in other regions. With a neutral loss scan, ZIC-HILIC resolved glucosylceramide species featuring non-hydroxylated fatty acid, hydroxylated fatty acid, and trihydroxy sphingoid bases in mouse epidermis samples. This demonstrates that our ZIC-HILIC-based approach is a valuable tool for characterizing the structural diversity of mono-glucosylated lipids in biological material and for quantifying these important lipids.","value":25},{"authors":[{"name":"Josephine Barnes"},{"name":"Jonathan W.

We review the structural MRI studies carried out in PD using either a manual region of interest (ROI) approach or voxel-based morphometry (VBM). ROI studies have shown that hippocampal volume is decreased in patients with PD with and without dementia; in addition, hippocampal atrophy correlated with deficits in verbal memory. VBM studies have demonstrated that dementia in PD involves structural changes in limbic areas and widespread cortical atrophy. Findings in nondemented patients with PD are less conclusive, possibly because cognitively heterogeneous groups of patients have been studied. Patients with PD with cognitive impairment and/or visual hallucinations present greater brain atrophy than patients without these characteristics. These findings suggest that cortical atrophy is related to cognitive dysfunction in PD and precedes the development of dementia.

Accordingly, the Small World connectivity pattern could represent a functional counterpart of structural hippocampal atrophying and related-network disconnection.","authors":[{"name":"Fabrizio Vecchio"},{"name":"Francesca Miraglia"},{"name":"Francesca Piludu"},{"name":"Giuseppe Granata"},{"name":"Roberto Romanello"},{"name":"Massimo Caulo"},{"name":"Valeria Onofrj"},{"name":"Placido Bramanti"},{"name":"Cesare Colosimo"},{"name":"Paolo Maria Rossini"}],"date":"2016/03/09","id":"p15dca3d0e765f3fb","value":55},{"title":"Transient Microneedle Insertion Into Hippocampus Triggers Neurogenesis and Decreases Amyloid Burden in a Mouse Model of Alzheimer’s Disease","abstract":"Targeted microlesions of the hippocampus have been reported to enhance neurogenesis in the subgranular zone (SGZ). The potential therapeutic impact of transient insertion of a microneedle was investigated in a mouse model of Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We tested the hypothesis that transient microinjury to the brain elicits cellular responses that mediate beneficial regenerative processes. Brief stereotaxic insertion and removal of a microneedle into the right hippocampus of 14-month-old APP/PS1 mouse brains resulted in (a) stimulation of hippocampal neurogenesis and (b) reduction of amyloid-β plaque number in the CA-1 region. This treatment also resulted in a trend toward improved performance in the radial arm water maze (RAWM). Further studies of fundamental cellular mechanisms of the brain’s response to microinjury will be useful for investigation of potential neuroprotective and deleterious effects of targeted microlesions and deep brain stimulation in AD.","authors":[{"name":"Song, Shijie"},{"name":"Kong, Xiaoyung"},{"name":"Sava, Vasyl"},{"name":"Cao, Chuanhai"},{"name":"Acosta, Sandra"},{"name":"Borlongan, Cesar"},{"name":"Sanchez-Ramos, Juan"}],"date":"2016/01/01","id":"p8ba21a0cb183c6bc","value":57},{"title":"Performance of Hippocampus Volumetry with FSL-FIRST for Prediction of Alzheimer’s Disease Dementia in at Risk Subjects with Amnestic Mild Cognitive Impairment","abstract":"MRI-based hippocampus volume, a core feasible biomarker of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), is not yet widely used in clinical patient care, partly due to lack of validation of software tools for hippocampal volumetry that are compatible with routine workflow.

Thus, FSL-FIRST provides about the same power for prediction of progression to ADD in aMCI as other volumetry methods.","authors":[{"name":"Suppa, Pera"},{"name":"Hampel, Harald"},{"name":"Kepp, Timo"},{"name":"Lange, Catharina"},{"name":"Spies, Lothar"},{"name":"Fiebach, Jochen"},{"name":"Dubois, Bruno"},{"name":"Buchert, Ralph"}],"date":"2016/03/30","id":"pb7b9a7989d9532d6","value":58},{"title":"Selective impairment of hippocampus and posterior hub areas in Alzheimer’s disease: an MEG-based multiplex network study","abstract":"Although frequency-specific network analyses have shown that functional brain networks are altered in patients with Alzheimer’s disease, the relationships between these frequency-specific network alterations remain largely unknown. Multiplex network analysis is a novel network approach to study complex systems consisting of subsystems with different types of connectivity patterns. In this study, we used magnetoencephalography to integrate five frequency-band specific brain networks in a multiplex framework. Previous structural and functional brain network studies have consistently shown that hub brain areas are selectively disrupted in Alzheimer’s disease. Accordingly, we hypothesized that hub regions in the multiplex brain networks are selectively targeted in patients with Alzheimer’s disease in comparison to healthy control subjects. Eyes-closed resting-state magnetoencephalography recordings from 27 patients with Alzheimer’s disease (60.6 ± 5.4 years, 12 females) and 26 controls (61.8 ± 5.5 years, 14 females) were projected onto atlas-based regions of interest using beamforming. Subsequently, source-space time series for both 78 cortical and 12 subcortical regions were reconstructed in five frequency bands (delta, theta, alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta band). Multiplex brain networks were constructed by integrating frequency-specific magnetoencephalography networks. Functional connections between all pairs of regions of interests were quantified using a phase-based coupling metric, the phase lag index. Several multiplex hub and heterogeneity metrics were computed to capture both overall importance of each brain area and heterogeneity of the connectivity patterns across frequency-specific layers. Different nodal centrality metrics showed consistently that several hub regions, particularly left hippocampus, posterior parts of the default mode network and occipital regions, were vulnerable in patients with Alzheimer’s disease compared to control subjects. Of note, these detected vulnerable hubs in Alzheimer’s disease were absent in each individual frequency-specific network, thus showing the value of integrating the networks. The connectivity patterns of these vulnerable hub regions in the patients were heterogeneously distributed across layers. Perturbed cognitive function and abnormal cerebrospinal fluid amyloid-β42 levels correlated positively with the vulnerability of the hub regions in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. Our analysis therefore demonstrates that the magnetoencephalography-based multiplex brain networks contain important information that cannot be revealed by frequency-specific brain networks. Furthermore, this indicates that functional networks obtained in different frequency bands do not act as independent entities. Overall, our multiplex network study provides an effective framework to integrate the frequency-specific networks with different frequency patterns and reveal neuropathological mechanism of hub disruption in Alzheimer’s disease.","authors":[{"name":"Meichen Yu"},{"name":"Marjolein M.

While some studies have implicated Lewy bodies in the neocortex, others have pointed to α-synuclein pathology in the hippocampus. We systematically examined hippocampal Lewy pathology and its distribution in hippocampal subfields in 95 clinically and neuropathologically characterized human cases of DLB, finding that α-synuclein pathology was highest in two hippocampal-related subregions: the CA2 subfield and the entorhinal cortex (EC). While the EC had numerous classic somatic Lewy bodies, CA2 contained mainly Lewy neurites in presumed axon terminals, suggesting the involvement of the EC → CA2 circuitry in the pathogenesis of DLB symptoms. Clinicopathological correlations with measures of verbal and visual memory supported a role for EC Lewy pathology, but not CA2, in causing these memory deficits. Lewy pathology in CA1—the main output region for CA2—correlated best with results from memory testing despite a milder pathology. This result indicates that CA1 may be more functionally relevant than CA2 in the context of memory impairment in DLB. These correlations remained significant after controlling for several factors, including concurrent Alzheimer's pathology (neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles) and the interval between time of testing and time of death. Our data suggest that although hippocampal Lewy pathology in DLB is predominant in CA2 and EC, memory performance correlates most strongly with CA1 burden.\n\nSIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT This study provides a detailed neuropathologic analysis of hippocampal Lewy pathology in human patients with autopsy-confirmed dementia with Lewy bodies. The approach—informed by regional molecular markers, concurrent Alzheimer's pathology analysis, and relevant clinical data—helps tease out the relative contribution of Lewy pathology to memory dysfunction in the disease. Levels of Lewy pathology were found to be highest in the hippocampal CA2 subregion and entorhinal cortex, implicating a potentially overlooked circuit in disease pathogenesis. However, correlation with memory performance was strongest with CA1. This unexpected finding suggests that Lewy pathology must reach a critical burden across hippocampal circuitry to contribute to memory dysfunction beyond that related to other factors, notably coexisting Alzheimer's disease tau pathology.","authors":[{"name":"David H.

The differential involvement of the hippocampal subfields in both diseases has not been clearly established, however. We aim to investigate hippocampal subfield differences in vivo in a clinical cohort of DLB and AD subjects.\n\nMethods\n\n104 participants (35 DLBs, 36 ADs, and 35 healthy comparison [HC] subjects) underwent clinical assessment and 3T T1-weighted imaging. A Bayesian model implemented in Freesurfer was used to automatically segment the hippocampus and its subfields. We also examined associations between hippocampal subfields and tests of memory function.\n\nResults\n\nBoth the AD and DLB groups demonstrated significant atrophy of the total hippocampus relative to HC but the DLB group was characterized by preservation of the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1), fimbria, and fissure. In contrast, all the hippocampal subfields except the fissure were significantly atrophied in AD compared with both DLB and HC groups. Among DLB subjects, CA1 was correlated with the Recent Memory score of the CAMCOG and Delayed Recall subscores of the HVLT.\n\nConclusions\n\nDLB is characterized by milder hippocampal atrophy that was accompanied by preservation of the CA1. The CA1 was also associated with memory function in DLB. Our findings highlight the promising role of hippocampal subfield volumetry, particularly that of the CA1, as a biomarker for the distinction between AD and DLB.","authors":[{"name":"Elijah Mak B.A."},{"name":"Li Su"},{"name":"Guy B.

Because various environmental factors influence the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease, in the present study, BPSD-like behavioral abnormality of Amyloid β (Aβ)1-42-injected mice was assessed under social isolation, which induces behavioral abnormality. Aβ protein (500 pmol) was injected into the lateral ventricle of mice, which were individually housed. Two and three weeks after injection into adult mice, the rate of mice that exhibited aggressive behavior, i.e., biting attacks and wrestling, to the total mice, was markedly increased by Aβ injection. Aβ-injected adult mice also showed anxiety-like behavior, in addition to cognitive decline. Serum corticosterone level was markedly increased by Aβ injection. When excitability of hippocampal neurons was checked using hippocampal slices, KCl-induced presynaptic activity was enhanced in hippocampal slices prepared from Aβ-injected mice. These results suggest that social isolation housing of Aβ1-42-injected adult mice induces BPSD-like behavioral abnormality in addition to cognitive decline. It is likely that behavioral abnormality of Aβ1-42-injected adult mice is associated with excitability of hippocampal glutamatergic neurons, which is associated with the elevated corticosterone level.","authors":[{"name":"Haruna Tamano"},{"name":"Kazuki Ide"},{"name":"Paul Anthony Adlard"},{"name":"Ashley Ian Bush"},{"name":"Atsushi Takeda"}],"date":"2016/08/04","id":"p1fe9c18c912078b3","value":62},{"title":"Performance on the Cogstate Brief Battery Is Related to Amyloid Levels and Hippocampal Volume in Very Mild Dementia","abstract":"In a group of older adults with very mild dementia, we aimed to characterize the nature and magnitude of cognitive decline as measured by the Cogstate Brief Battery, in relation to Aβ levels and hippocampal volume. Participants were characterized according to their status on the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scale. A total of 308 individuals who were CDR 0 and had low cerebral Aβ levels (Aβ−), 32 individuals who were Aβ− and CDR 0.5, and 43 individuals who were Aβ+ and CDR 0.5 were included in this study. Participants completed the CogState brief battery at baseline, and at 18-, 36-, 54- and 72-month follow-up. Linear mixed model analyses indicated that relative to the Aβ− CDR 0 group, the Aβ+ CDR 0.5 group showed increased rates of memory decline and hippocampal volume loss. However, compared to the Aβ− CDR 0 group, the Aβ− CDR 0.5 group showed no changes in cognitive function or hippocampal volume over 72 months. The results of this study confirm that in individuals with very mild dementia, who also have biomarker confirmation of Aβ+, changes in cognitive function manifest primarily as deterioration in memory processing, and this is associated with hippocampal volume loss. Conversely, the absence of any cognitive decline or loss in hippocampal volume in individuals with very mild dementia but who are Aβ− suggests that some other non-AD disease process may underlie any static impairment in cognitive function.","authors":[{"name":"Yen Ying Lim"},{"name":"Victor L.

Recently, its indication has been extended experimentally to a wide range of disorders including inflammation-mediated central nervous system disorders such as Parkinson disease (PD) and multiple sclerosis (MS). In this study, we investigate whether DM treatment has protective effects on the hippocampal neuron damage induced by bilateral occlusion of the common carotid arteries (two-vessel occlusion [2VO]), an animal model of vascular dementia (VaD). Sprague–Dawley (SD) (10 weeks of age) rats were subjected to the 2VO, and DM was injected intraperitoneally once per day for 37 days. Neuron death, glial activation, and cognitive function were assessed at 37 days after 2VO (0.2 mg/kg, i.p., “DM-0.2” and 2 mg/kg, i.p., “DM-2”). DM-2 treatment provided protection against neuronal death and glial activation in the hippocampal CA1 subfield and reduced cognitive impairment induced by 2VO in rats. The study also demonstrates that activation of the Nrf2-HO-1 pathway and upregulation of superoxide dismutase (SOD) play important roles in these effects. These results suggest that DM is effective in treating VaD and protecting against oxidative stress, which is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of VaD. Therefore, the present study suggests that DM treatment may represent a new and promising protective strategy for treating VaD.","authors":[{"name":"Xiaofeng Xu"},{"name":"Bin Zhang"},{"name":"Kaili Lu"},{"name":"Jiangshan Deng"},{"name":"Fei Zhao"},{"name":"Bing-qiao Zhao"},{"name":"Yuwu Zhao"}],"date":"2016/02/18","id":"pa184d881e567c655","value":64},{"title":"Atrophy of hippocampal subfields and adjacent extrahippocampal structures in dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer's disease","abstract":"The hippocampus and adjacent extrahippocampal structures are organized in distinct and specialized regions which process heterogeneous functions, including memory, and visuospatial functions.
