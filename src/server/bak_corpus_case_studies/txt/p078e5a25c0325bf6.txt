Despite considerable research uncover them the anatomic and neuropathologic correlates memory impairment dementia with

Clinicopathological correlations with measures verbal and visual memory supported role for EC Lewy pathology but not causing

Results
Case characterization
Two thirds the DLB cases were the neocortical subtype 
indicating that diffuse pathology had reached the neocortex the
time death The remaining cases were mostly the limbic 
transitional variety with only five cases with pathology restricted
 the brainstem our entire cohort Patients falling into this
last category usually not have dementia therefore expect
their cognitive symptoms result something other than
Lewy pathology Neocortical and limbic cases displayed 
male predominance there were female brainstem only cases

Neuropathologic findings
All but three cases our cohort had some level neurofibrillary
tangle pathology Table Of those three two did not have any
amyloid plaques meaning that out cases had some type
 coexisting AD pathology addition Lewy pathology Lack
 plaques was more common overall cases especially
among limbic cases more than one third without plaques 
whereas the vast majority cases had moderate amount 
amyloid pathology Thal phase Among the cases without
plaques had low Braak stage II less which often observed with age cognitively normal adults Crary 
these could therefore considered pure DLB cases Braak
stages V and VI were the most common among our cases indicating severe tangle pathology This finding was driven the
neocortical cases since most limbic cases showed milder levels 
tangles Braak stage III

 also expressed low levels and Therefore more
specific MF stain was used confirm the finding Another synuclein antibody that recognizes early oligomeric

correlations between memory performance and Lewy pathology

burden and memory should viewed with caution since multiple comparisons increased the chance false positive errors We
attempted mitigate this problem some degree including
only four key memory variables the partial correlation analyses We chose not correct for multiple comparisons because
the analyses were exploratory significant correlations consistently involved rather than occurring randomly and the
results the partial correlations with were confirmed

 We chose use raw counts for tangles and plaques rather than

A previous study suggested that Lewy pathology the hippocampus harbored local interneurons least the case 
PDD Flores Cuadrado However such colocalization was observed our study data not shown and only very
little was found another study focusing DLB Bernstein 
 Early work examining neuronal subtypes containing
LBs temporal cortex revealed that the majority localized 
pyramidal cells and not interneurons positive for parvalbumin
 Wakabayashi More recent work mice confirmed
that native nonaggregated synuclein was detected excitatory
synapses but not inhibitory interneurons the hippocampus 
due this intrinsic difference endogenous synuclein levels 
hippocampal inhibitory interneurons were less likely form inclusions culture when triggered exogenous synuclein fibrils Taguchi This discrepancy may suggest distinct
substrates underlying the dementia PD and that DLB 
Although the Lewy pathology burden was less than 
 only the former correlated with measures learning and
memory This correlation was observed even after accounting for
the significant impact tangle pathology These results
indicate that the effects Lewy pathology learning and memory become most apparent later stage pathology since all
cases except for one with pathology also had pathology 
 but not vice versa suggesting that pathology prerequisite for pathology The finding that Lewy pathol 
ogy burden had stronger correlation with learning and memory
than burden despite less Lewy pathology consistent with results previous MRI studies showing that volume was most predictive memory scores patients with DLB

Our study has several limitations One the relatively long

 results degree postmortem pathology not fully reflective
 pathology burden the time testing which most likely
worse given the progressive nature the disease Another limitation that the pathogenic form aggregated synuclein 
unknown While focused the version hyperphosphorylated
 previous reports suggest that oligomeric forms 
the protein are most toxic Roberts We attempted
 address this issue cross validating some our findings
using conformer specific antibodies for synuclein including
one that preferentially recognizes oligomers While the best
method assess Lewy pathology burden remains unclear our
rigorous anatomical and molecular approach has yielded important insights 
Eight our cases lacked hippocampal Lewy pathology yet
still had memory dysfunction It conceivable that Lewy pathology was present these cases but overlooked from our sampling
method one single hippocampal section from the posterior left
hemisphere For instance the amygdala and fornix two prominent regions involved memory consolidation but not specifically examined this study may have harbored Lewy pathology 
The majority these cases did have significant AD pathology 
the hippocampus however and that along with significant atrophy may have caused their memory impairment As for the couple cases also lacking AD pathology unusual alternate disease
processes may blame for instance one case had concomitant Fahrs syndrome causing calcifications the basal ganglia
and cortex that have been associated with dementia 
While tangles were pervasive our cohort and strongly
correlated with both verbal and visual memory dysfunction 
Lewy pathology contributed memory performance
above and beyond the effects tau pathology This finding suggests convergence pathologies with possible additive effect
 cognitive dysfunction The relationship may even causal 
has been suggested that phospho synuclein promotes the phosphorylation tau Iseki Guo Our findings therefore support the view that many cases dementia are
not due single type neuropathologic lesion but rather 
mix several Additional studies will necessary elucidate
the precise sequence progression Lewy pathology DLB
and how relates cognitive decline However the results lend
credence model whereby impairment learning and memory becomes most apparent once Lewy pathology has reached

This finding suggests that hippocampal Lewy pathology must

better understanding the mechanisms governing aggregate
