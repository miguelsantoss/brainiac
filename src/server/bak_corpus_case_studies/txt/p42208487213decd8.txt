Summary
In recent years nerve growth factor NGF has gained
attention potential therapeutic
agent for Alzheimers disease AD To study the expression NGF and
its homologs brain derived
neurotrophic
factor BDNF 
and neurotrophin
 postmortem samples hippocampus from AD and control donors were examined
 situ hybridization 
Hybridization
signal for BDNF 
but not NGF was decreased samples hippocampus from donors with AD Decreased transcript
abundance BDNF mRNA hippocampi individuals
with AD was verified RNAase protection
assay 
These results suggest the possibility that decreased expression BDNF may contribute the progression 
cell death AD 
Introduction
Increasing evidence indicates that nerve growth factor NGF plays role trophic support basal forebrain cholinergic
neurons Hefti Perry 
 The association between loss basal forebrain
cholinergic
neurons and memory loss Alzheimers
disease AD has been taken suggest that agents
which maintain the function these cells might 
used slow the deterioration
 cognitive function
that occurs this disease Hefti Perry 
? Marx Although
NGF has been proposed
 potential therapeutic
agent for AD Hefti 
 Perry Marx there evidence 
indicate that this disease associated with signific ant deficiency
 NGF Goedert Reports
concerning
NGF receptor expression AD have been
somewhat conflicting 
but suggest that deficiency 
NGF receptor expression
 unlikely involved 
the etiology the disease Higgins and Mufson 
Goedert Hefti and Mash Kordower
Recent observations
suggest the possibility
that
 NGF homolog 
brain derived
neurotrophic
factor
IBDNF may also serve trophic factor for basal
torebrain cholinergiccells 
athird member the NGF

 While increasing
evidence indicates that NCF
may serve trophic agent for the basal forebrain

system see Hefti there 
evidence support the suggestion that deficiency

indicate that
BDNF one two known NGF homologs

neurons and capable exerting trophic actions

 the
hybridization
signals for BDNF NGF and 
those obtained with the N CAM probe revealed that
only BDNFIN CAM

It not clear whether the roughly fold reduction

that most not all our AD samples represent end

 possible that variations quality RNA may have contributed
