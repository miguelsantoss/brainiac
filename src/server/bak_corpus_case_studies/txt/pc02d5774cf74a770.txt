Summary We studied the usefulness measuring volumes the hippocampus amygdala and frontal lobes with coronal magnetic resonance
imaging MRI scans the diagnosis early Alzheimers disease AD 
We examined patients diagnosed according the NINCDS ADRDA
criteria probable AD and age matched healthy cognitively normal controls The AD patients had mild dementia with mean score the
Mini Mental Status Examination MMSE We used T magnetic resonance imager and normalized the volumes for brain area The AD patients
had significantly smaller volumes the right and the left hippocampus
 ANOVA and the left frontal lobe 
compared controls The reductions volumes the right frontal
lobe the right amygdala the left amygdala 
were not statistically significant In the discriminant function analysis which
included the volumes the hippocampus amygdala and the frontal lobes
and age the volumes the left and right hippocampus the left and
right frontal lobe and the right amygdala entered the model and could
correctly classify the subjects into AD and control groups Chi square
 By using the volumes the hippocampus the frontal
lobes the amygdala their alone the correct classification was achieved
 and the subjects respectively In addition AD
patients the volumes the left hippocampus correlated significantly with the
MMSE score and with immediate and delayed verbal memory the smaller the
volume the more impaired was their performance Our data indicate that
measurements volumes the hippocampus might useful diagnosis

Introduction
There are problems the clinical diagnosis Alzheimers disease AD 
accuracy between the best one can achieve Sulkava 
McKhann Thus the definitive diagnosis can obtained only 
means biopsy autopsy McKhann Imaging methods computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI are 
integral part the diagnostic assessment patients with suspected dementia
and help detect specific central nervous system causes dementia such 
brain tumor vascular lesions normal pressure hydrocephalus and chronic
subdural haematoma The value linear planimetric and volumetric measurements various regions interest CT scans have been under scrutiny
 attempts separate AD patients from elderly controls DeCarli 
 Recently similar approaches have been applied with MRI scans MRI
studies though varying some extent have shown interesting and promising
results providing reliable non invasive method for the diagnosis AD 
Therefore wanted confirm some the previous results and seek 
reliable means improving the accuracy the diagnosis AD volumetric measurements using MRI 
Previous studies applying CT have shown that volumetric measurements
were able classify AD patients and control subjects DeCarli
 Functional techniques such measuring cerebral glucose metabolism and regional cerebral blood flow with positron emission tomography
and single photon emission computed tomography SPECT have also been
used for the diagnosis AD Haxby Pearlson 
SPECT measurements alone were able differentiate the ADpatients from the controls By combining SPECT with MRI the results have
been even better Pearlson Magnetic resonance spectroscopy 
method recently introduced study metabolism the brain has also been
utilized examining AD patients Bottomley Klunk 
Longo Furthermore measurement magnetic resonance 
relaxation time the hippocampus has shown promising results with the
prolongation the relaxation time correlating with the severity AD
symptoms Kirsch 
Earlier studies the volumetric MRI diagnosis AD and also the
normal variations and the changes aging have focused the temporal lobe
 whole individually the temporal neocortex the superior temporal
gyrus the hippocampal formation the uncus the entorhinal cortex the
parahippocampal gyrus and the amygdala Ventricular spaces interest have
been the ventricles the temporal horns the interuncal distance the temporal
sulci and the Sylvian fissures well the choroidal fissure the subarachnoid
space and the cerebrospinal fluid Moreover several extratemporal regions
have been measured such the brain parenchyma the frontal cortex the
parietal cortex the corpus callosum the basal forebrain and the basal ganglia 
striatum nucleus caudatus and nucleus lenticularis Seab

In aging MRI studies have detected decreased volumes the anterior
diencephalic structures the grey matter most cortical regions especially
 association cortices and mesial temporal lobe structures Jernigan 
 and the caudate nucleus Krishnan Jernigan 
The age related changes the white matter are also manifest prolonged
 values Jernigan The volumes the lateral ventricles have
been reported increase per year Coffey There are
also normal variations the temporal lobe including notching the uncus
and asymmetry the temporal horns Mild asymmetry the hippocampal
head and mild enlargement the right temporal lobe were not uncommon 
Other variations were subtle asymmetry the white matter between the
hippocampus and the collateral sulcus atypical sulci and Sylvian fissure dilatation Bronen and Cheung 
Despite the intense effort define accurate variable structure 
combination structures even combination structural and functional
measurements reveal early AD uniformity simple answer has been
achieved The Consortium Establish Registry for Alzheimers Disease
 CERAD has tried develop procedures for standardized imaging and
reporting MRI findings but satisfactory interrater agreement for interpreting MRI findings elderly subjects was found Acceptable intraclass correlations group neuroradiologist were obtained only the ratings the
lateral and third ventricles and the temporal horn What needed are more
objective and reproducible procedures for interpretation neuroimaging
findings AD Davis 
We chose the hippocampus and the amygdala well neocortical
region the frontal lobe regions interest Memory loss the most
common early symptom AD The hippocampus which closely associated
with memory processing known vulnerable damage the early
stage AD Hyman The purpose our study was assess the
usefulness MRI volume measurements the diagnosis early AD To this
end measured the volumes the hippocampus the amygdala and the
frontal lobes using thin slices obtain precise information possible To
test the value volume measurements tool separate AD patients from
controls applied discriminant function analysis We also correlated the
volumes these brain regions with the patients performance tests assessing verbal and visual memory well executive functions

determine the boundaries the amygdala and the hippocampus oblique coronal MRI
sections The method has been reported previously detail Soininen The
boundaries the region interest were outlined trackball driven cursor and the
number voxels within the region was calculated using house developed
program for standard work console The outlining the boundaries always proceeded
from anterior posterior 
The outlines the amygdala included the deep nuclei the amygdala the superficial
nuclei the amygdala and the remaining nuclei the amygdala At the most rostral
sections the amygdala outlined only the deep amygdaloid nuclei the MRI image

cortex The hippocampus included the dentate gyrus the hippocampus proper and the
subicular complex The uncal portion the rostral hippocampus that located ventral 
the caudal amygdala was included into the hippocampus The caudal end the hippocampus was determined from the section which the fornices were still detectable 
their full length 
To determine the volumes the frontal lobes the gyri were manually outlined 
every third slice Thus due thin slices the measurement was done interval 
 The most anterior the slices was the one with clearly visible gyri On the most
posterior slices straight line was drawn from the bottom the lateral fissure the
choroidal fissure order separate the temporal lobe from the frontal lobe From the
bottom the choroidal fissure line was drawn above the optic tract the midline and
then line was drawn vertically the interhemispheric cerebral fissure The most caudal
slice included the measurement was the one which the anterior commissure was
present The volume the lateral ventricles was also measured and consequently subtracted from the volume the slice The volume each slice was multiplied three and
thereafter the slice volumes were summed 
In the statistical analysis used volumes the region interest normalized for the
brain area Normalization was done dividing the volumes the hippocampus 
amygdala the frontal lobe brain area To obtain brain area measured the area
 both hemispheres MR image taken the level the anterior commissure The
normalization yielded ratios volume the region interest brain area We used normalized values all statistical analyses 
The intrarater agreement this method has been reported earlier Soininen 
 The interrater reproducibility between two raters was tested subjects The
differences between the volumes obtained two raters compared the mean these
two measurements were for the right hippocompus and for the left hippocampus for the right amygdala and for the left amygdala 
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed utilizing SPSS PC V software SPSS Inc Chicago IL 
In all statistical analyses the volumetric data used volumes normalized for brain

Discussion
This study focused volumes the hippocampus 
amygdala and frontal lobes O purpose was search for reliable means
for diagnosing early A D using MRI In optimize the volumetric
 used developed house calculate the volumes 
 the structures interest whole and thin slices optimally
oriented for mesial structures which believe provides excellent
accuracy and reproducibility The use stereology for
measuring volumes specific structures M R I Krishnan The
 M R I volumetry however accurate and reduces stages 
which variability can introduced Kesslak 
We found decrease the volume the right and left hippocampus
 A D patients control O main finding was the accuracy
obtained differentiating the A D group from the controls discriminant
function analysis using the hippocampal frontal lobe and amygdaloid volumes T volumes the hippocampi and the left frontal lobe were significantly smaller the A D group controls and those were the best
discriminators the discriminant function analysis The diminished volumes
 the left hippocampus correlated with the decline M M S E scores and
M P Laakso 
impaired verbal memory Impaired performance the Trail Making test 
which test considered assess frontal lobe functions was associated with
decreased volumes the frontal lobes 
In previous study the hippocampus measured from single slice did not
differ size between the early AD group and controls nod 
In agreement with this Erkinjuntti and coworkers measured hippocampal
area the level the hippocampal head and were able differentiate only
 the early AD group from the controls Erkinjuntti Thus 
measurements the hippocampal area from one slice have not been 
successful differentiating the AD group from controls volumetric results 
which have yielded greater accuracy For example Seab and coworkers detected overlap hippocarnpal volumes among early AD patients and 
controls Seab Kesslak found reduction the
hippocampal volume the early AD group compared age matched
controls Kesslak In another study hippocampal volumes 
 early AD patients fell below those controls Jack 
Killiany and coworkers could correctly identify the controls and the
early AD group using discriminant function analysis including combination volumes hippocampus and temporal horn the lateral ventricle
 Killiany 
In line with our findings vitro T MR microscopy study the
hippocampus AD indicated that the cross sectional area the hippocampus was decreased compared the control group Huesgen 
 This atrophy was also highly correlated with tangle counts within the
hippocampus but not with plaque counts In addition recent study using
stereological techniques compare the regional pattern neuronal cell loss
 the hippocampus showed that AD patients have neuronal loss the
hilus loss the region and loss the subiculum greater than
those found normal aging West 
Studies non human primates have suggested that the hippocampus 
well the adjacent neocortex are necessary for acquisition temporary storage and retrieval explicit memory Zola Morgan In normal
subjects study measuring regional cerebral blood flow using the 
method showed that the right hippocampal region activated association
with memory function Squire In epileptic patients focus the
right hippocampus led impairment visual memory tests whereas left
hippocampal foci were associated with impairment verbal memory tests
 Miller In agreement with earlier human data which have emphasized the importance the hippocampus for associative memory our study
also showed significant association between the shrinkage the left hippocampus and impairment verbal memory AD patients 
Taken together previous studies and our results suggest that the volume
 the hippocampus sensitive measure AD already the early course
 the disease By measuring only the volume the left hippocampus the AD
patients were separated from controls with sensitivity and specificity Hippocampal atrophy however not specific nor exclusive 
AD The volume hippocampus has been shown decrease for example 
epilepsy schizophrenia and circumscribed amnesia Press Jack 
MRI volumetry Alzheimers disease
 Suddath Data hippocampal volumes patients with
other dementing disorders such vascular dementia and Parkinson
dementia are not available However many dementing illnesses the clinical symptoms and other changes CT MRI scans such ischemic
lesions are useful diagnostic aids 
In the present study the volumes the right amygdala control 
 the left amygdala were not significantly reduced AD patients 
This finding agrees with some Killiany but not all previous
studies Scott Pearlson Cudnod nod
 measured volumes amygdala patients with early AD and 
controls and found difference the volume the amygdala with
only one overlap between the AD and the control group nod 
Killiany did not detect any significant difference the volumes the
amygdala between early AD patients and controls Killiany 
In another study the combined volumes the left amygdala and the left
entorhinal cortex identified patients with moderately severe AD
and controls Only two levels the amygdala were measured
 Pearlson In autopsy study Scott found patients with
advanced AD that the amygdalar nuclei showed significant atrophy except for
the paralaminar portion basal nucleus compared age matched controls 
The magnocellular regions the amygdala showed proportionally greater
size reductions than other areas Scott

 the measurement the amygdala has proved complicated In the
study nod for example the interrater variability was 
 nod Separating the anterior amygdala and the amygdala
from uncus seem the most difficult task the measurement and 
responsible for much the variability the measurements Davis 
 Jack Pearlson Tien nod 
 Killiany Our radiologists also agreed that the anterior
amygdala was the most difficult the structures which they had measure 
In spite the more complicated anatomy and shape the hippocampus 
was easier and could measured more exactly than the amygdala Jack 
 Tien By using imaging planes oriented perpendicular 
the hippocampus together with proper imaging parametres heavily weighted fast spin echo sequence that maximize gray white matter contrast 
the entire hippocampus can reliably measured Press Bronen
and Cheung Tien This view also supported our
better interrater reliability data for the hippocampus than for the amygdala 
In addition the differences and difficulties methodology the discrepancy
 volumes the amygdala distinct studies probably due differences 
the clinical severity the AD patients studied 
The good results separating the AD group and the controls our study
suggest that such volumetric measurements might useful the diagnosis 
early AD The most efficient discriminating measures were the volumes the
right and left hippocampus and the left frontal lobe Nonetheless 
accuracy diagnosis remains elusive
