INTRODUCTION
Various expert groups including the National Institute Aging Alzheimers Association NIA AA 
working group the International Working Group
 IWG and the European Federation the
Neurological Societies EFNS task force recommend the use magnetic resonance imaging
 MRI based hippocampus volume biomarker for
neurodegeneration complement symptom based
criteria for improved prognostic accuracy amnestic
mild cognitive impairment aMCI 
Manual segmentation the hippocampus 
expert considered the gold standard for hippocampus volumetry However manual segmentation 
time consuming and therefore hardly compatible with
routine workflow the typical diagnosis setting
with high patient throughput In contrast fullyautomated and computationally efficient software
tools provide the potential translate hippocampus volumetry into clinical routine There
are several commercial and non commercial software tools for hippocampus volumetry available 
some which have been evaluated the European Medicines Agency EMA process 
qualification hippocampus volume imaging
biomarker for enrichment clinical trials predementia stages Alzheimers disease AD 
Despite considerable methodological differences all
 the tested tools provided about the same power
for prediction conversion AD dementia ADD 
 MCI subjects from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI Our group 
recently proposed processing pipeline for fullyautomated hippocampus volumetry based the
Statistical Parametric Mapping SPM software
package version Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging London UK The SPM software 
freely available and well documented open source 
The prognostic accuracy the processing
pipeline ADNI aMCI subjects was very good
agreement with the EMA results However the
 processing pipeline uses global stereotactical
normalization into template space and predefined
standard hippocampus atlas mask delineate the hippocampus template space The hippocampus mask
selected for this application rather large order
 account for residual anatomical variability after
stereotactical normalization As consequence hippocampus volume estimated the pipeline 
considerably larger than hippocampus volume from
manual segmentation according the harmonized
protocol proposed recently This limitation
 the atlas based approach 
The aim the present study was evaluate the
performance another freely available software tool 
FSL FIRST which was developed for anatomical
segmentation subcortical structures including the
hippocampus FSL FIRST deploys model based
segmentation for accurate anatomical delineation

MATERIAL AND METHODS
ADNI subjects
MRI data used this study were obtained
from the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative ADNI database http adni loni usc edu The
ADNI was launched public private
partnership led Principal Investigator Michael
W Weiner MD The primary goal ADNI has
been test whether serial MRI positron emission
tomography other biological markers and clinical
and neuropsychological assessment can combined
 measure the progression MCI and early AD 
In brief aMCIs from phase the ADNI were
included ADNI aMCIs who had converted ADD
within period months after months 
between and months and between and
 months and ADNI aMCIs who had remained
stable over months In addition ADNI normals
with T screening MRI were included controls 
All them had been documented normal throughout period months after baseline clinical
examination No subjects were excluded based 
poor image quality A more detailed description eligibility criteria and the characteristics the included
cohorts given 
Two D weighted magnetization prepared

Hippocampal volumetry
In preparation the application FSL FIRST 
all D MPRAGE images were transformed into
 common coordinate system rigid body
 registration whole brain template 
the Montreal Neurological Institute MNI space
was used for this preprocessing step Then hippocampus segmentation was performed using the
FIRST module from the FMRIBs Software Library
 FSL version http fsl fmrib fsl The
run first all routine was applied with slight modification enable larger search region and normalized
mutual information cost function described 
 The total hippocampus volume FIRST HV 
was obtained summing hippocampus volume 
left and right hemisphere 
FSL FIRST uses hippocampus model comprising shape and intensity information The model has
been derived from weighted MRIs which
the hippocampus was delineated manually These
MRIs were registered globally MNI space affine
 parameter registration A second local registration was restricted subcortical structures The
variation shape and intensity modeled multivariate Gaussian distribution A detailed description
 the method given 
Short term test retest stability
Short term test retest stability hippocampus volumetry FSL FIRST was assessed using the
repeat MPRAGE scan from the baseline imaging session the ADNI aMCI subjects The difference
between the two FIRST HV estimates was characterized the signed difference and 
the relative signed difference 
 where and denote FIRST HV from
the first and from the repeat MPRAGE scan within
the baseline imaging session Analysis variance
 ANOVA was used test the mean the signed
difference and the mean the relative signed difference for group effect difference between the 
aMCI subgroups The Levene test was used test
the variance the two measures for group effect 
gies Louisville CO which has been shown 
provide excellent agreement with manual tracing 
the hippocampus HV SNT values were available for download from the ADNI homepage for 
 the ADNI aMCIs stable aMCIs 
Correction for total intracranial volume and age
For each individual subject FIRST HV from the
first baseline MPRAGE scan was adjusted mean
total intracranial volume TIV and mean
age years the control group based bilinear regression FIRST HV with TIV and age 
independent variables the control group The
adjusted total hippocampus volume denoted 
FIRST HVad 
The based HV toolbox was used for
TIV estimation although the FSL software provides
possibilities obtain the TIV for example using
the Brain Extraction Tool BET with corrections 
described and the use different software
tools general means additional effort for the user 
The rationale for using the based HV toolbox
for TIV estimation was simplify the comparison
with TIV and age adjusted hippocampus volume
from the processing pipeline avoid additional
variability different TIV estimates The HV
toolbox freely available from the SPM website 
http www fil ion ucl spm ext HV 
ROC analysis
Receiver operating characteristic ROC analysis was used evaluate the power FIRST HVad
for differentiation between the ADNI aMCI ADD
converters and the stable ADNI aMCIs The area
 AUC under the ROC curve was used performance measure The open source R package pROC
was deployed for ROC analysis 
Cut off values for estimation prognostic accuracy were obtained Youdens method Accuracy
measures were cross validated correct for overfitting using repeats fold cross validation

eral hippocampus volume estimated FSL FIRST 
Signed difference and relative signed difference 
FIRST HV from the two back back MPRAGE
scans the ADNI baseline imaging session were both
very small Table demonstrating very high testretest stability FIRST HV The actual estimates 
the hippocampus volume FIRST HV were used for
the test retest analysis rather than hippocampus volume corrected for TIV and age FIRST HVad order
 avoid additional variability due test retest variability based TIV estimates FSL FIRST
was applied exactly the same ADNI aMCI subjects
that had previously been included the evaluation
 based processing pipeline Although
both methods are quite distinct methodologically the
predictive accuracy these subjects was about the
same AUC FSL FIRST was 
 and for prediction aMCIto ADD conversion within and months 
respectively The performance FSL FIRST also
 good agreement with the performance other tools
evaluated ADNI MCI subjects In the EMA study 
for example AUC for prediction MCI ADD
conversion within months ranged from 
 This suggests that the method used for quantitative estimation the hippocampus volume has only 
small impact its predictive power A possible explanation this might intrinsic limitation the
hippocampus volume prognostic marker aMCI 
that upper threshold for its accuracy considerably below which also the best volumetry
cannot surpass 
FIRST HV showed high correlation with the semiautomated HV SNT values which turn have been
shown provide excellent agreement with manual
tracing the hippocampus The correlation with
HV SNT was considerably stronger for FSL FIRST
than for the processing pipeline Pearsons
correlation coefficient versus This
indicates that the model based FSL FIRST method
indeed achieves more accurate delineation the
individual hippocampus MPRAGE images than
the atlas based approach However should
 noted that other methods for fully automatic
hippocampus volumetry might provide even higher
agreement with manual delineation For example 
Wolz and workers reported very high intraclass
correlation between the learning embeddings for atlas
propagation LEAP method and manual delineation
 two way mixed single measures intraclass correlation coefficient ICC 
Ahdidan and colleagues using another multi atlas
method for fully automated hippocampus volumetry found very high spatial agreement with manual
hippocampal segmentation measured the Dice
Similarity Coefficient average 
Hippocampus segmentation FSL FIRST clearly
failed only one out subjects This demonstrates the robustness the method which 
important prerequisite for use everyday clinical
routine However important note that this
robustness was achieved only after some minor modifications the original FSL FIRST pipeline namely
 rigid body transformation each individual MRI
into template space prior application FSL FIRST
and spatial extension FSL FIRSTs hippocampus search space has been suggested previously
CONCLUSION
Hippocampus volumetry with FSL FIRST provides about the same performance for prediction 
aMCI ADD conversion other tools This qualifies FSL FIRST added the list freely
available hippocampus volumetry tools for use 
clinical routine Compared the atlas based 
approach model based FSL FIRST provides more
accurate anatomical delineation the hippocampus
and therefore more accurate estimates
