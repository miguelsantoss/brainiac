learning and memory functions 
Oxidative stress believed play important role the
pathogenesis different neurodegenerative diseases agerelated patients such those with Parkinsons disease PD 
 Huntingtons disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis
 An increasing number studies have shown that oxidative
stress strongly implicated the pathogenesis VaD and
particularly nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate
 NADPH oxidase mediated oxidative stress plays 
important role neuronal cell death and cognitive dysfunction 
VaD Several studies have confirmed
that antioxidant therapy such the use vitamins pioglitazone aliskiren and curcumin may play role the prevention
and treatment AD and VaD However antioxidant
therapies have not achieved the intended results New and effective intervention strategies for preventing VO induced neuron
death and cognitive impairment need further investigated

Dextromethorphan DM known component cough
medicine that widely used clinics At doses ranging from
 DM inhibits voltage gated channels stimulates receptors and works non competitive antagonist N methyl D aspartate NMDA receptors For these
properties DM has been confirmed exert neuroprotection 
models cerebral ischemia spinal cord injury and epilepsy
 Recently accumulating evidence has demonstrated that
DM other morphinans could inhibit the production reactive
oxygen species ROS activated microglia macrophages 
exert neuroprotective effect age related diseases such 
atherosclerosis hypertension PD and MS 
Furthermore DM has been used clinically for decades with 
proven safety record and small molecule that can administered orally suggesting that DM ideal for long term treatment Based these properties DM the current study was
conducted test the hypothesis that DM may improve cognitive
function VO animals inhibiting oxidative stress The results this study may provide novel alternative strategy 
ameliorate the cognitive dysfunction VaD patients 
In this study explored the neuroprotective effects and
mechanisms using the VO rat model We found that DM
treatment could significantly ameliorate neuron degeneration
 the hippocampal region and improve cognitive function The pathway and upregulation SOD were

robust source oxidative stress where extracellular ROS 
generated from several enzymes including iNOS NADPH

responsible for inflammatory processes mediated oxidative

through the inhibition microglial cell production NO 
secretion cytokines such TNF and release superoxide free radicals doses and exert protective
effects MS dose Based these researches 
two different doses DM treatment were
used the study In the study treatment alleviated
microglial activation accompanied oxidative stress the
hippocampus Fig and the effect was even more
significant the optic tract area Fig which more
sensitive CCH These data suggest that DM treatment could
inhibit the microglia activation exert antioxidant effect 
Accumulating evidence indicates that DM treatment could
target the expression and activity NADPH present microglia exert neuroprotective effects atherosclerosis hypertension PD and MS However our results
show that expression does not change the hippocampus VO induced VaD data not shown These results are consistent with the previous report that rather than plays key role the pathophysiology 
CCH induced cognitive decline and brain injury Based
 the vital role VaD assessed the level 
 the hippocampus and the results show that DM
treatment significantly decreased the level

results previous reports that DM increased SOD reduced

striatal regions monosodium glutamate induced neurodegeneration rats and improved neuroprotection 
Among the antioxidant enzymes particularly noteworthy not only because degrades toxic heme but also because produces multiple neuroprotective molecules including the antioxidant biliverdin and carbon monoxide 
Recent studies have also demonstrated that brain derived neurotrophic factor BDNF and glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor GDNF expression was upregulated following
the upregulation dopaminergic neurons 
In our study found that DM treatment enhanced the
nuclear translocation upregulate the activation 
These results suggest that DM exerts its protective
effect activating the pathway 
In summary our study provides novel insight that DM
could protect neurons against the damage induced VaD 
The present study the first demonstration the mechanistic
involvement these neuroprotective effects Thus this research provides promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment VaD
