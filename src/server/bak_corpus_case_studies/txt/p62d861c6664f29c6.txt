Key words Glutamate N methyl D aspartate NMDA Excitatoryamino acid receptor Hippocampus Alzheimers disease
We examined the distribution and density N methyl Iaspartate NMDA displaceable L Hglutamatebinding sites human
hippocampal samples obtained postmortem from Alzheimers disease AD patients and from age matched controls Binding 
NMDA receptors was stable for least postmortem and the pharmacologicalprofile corresponded that described using electrophysiology NMDA receptors were concentrated the terminal fields major hippocampal pathways including the perforant
path Schaffer collaterals and the hippocampal output the subiculum all which are proposed use excitatory amino acid
transmitter Little any change hippocampal receptor density was observed AD patients compared age matched controls except one case where major hippocampal cell loss occurred The distribution NMDA receptors did however correspond the
predilection for neuritic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles hippocampal subfields 
Alzheimers disease AD neurodegenerative
disorder characterized pathologically the presence neurofibrillary tangles neuritic plaques and
neuronal cell loss specific cortical and subcortical
areas Several investigators have reported severe and consistent neuronal degeneration the entorhinal cortex subiculum and hippocampus 
which suggested functionally disconnect the cortex from the hippocampus 
In previous studies demonstrated that axon
sprouting occurs the dentate gyrus the hippocampal formation the brain A D patients The
loss entorhinal afferents triggers compensatory
growth the remaining inputs the dentate gyrus 
We have postulated that this mechanism rebuilds the
circuitry and slows the functional decline this critical relay In order for this process operative 
however necessary that the appropriate postsynaptic receptors present serve these afferents 
The excitatory amino acids glutamate aspartate
and possibly related compounds are thought the
transmitters the entorhinal input the hippocampus major intrahippocampal pathways and the
hippocampal output the subiculum Of particular relevance the excitatory amino acid receptor
which recognizes N methyl D aspartate NMDA 
which concentrated the terminal fields these
major hippocampal pathways N M D A receptors are thought mediate memory formation since
N M D A receptor antagonists block long term potentiation presumed synaptic analogue memory 
 well learning spatial task Thus the presence N M D A receptors critical for normal memory functions 
We examined the distribution and density 
N M D A receptors the human hippocampus using 
newly
developed
autoradiographic
N M D A receptor distribution can visualized using
L Hglutamate and when binding conditions are optimized low temperature short incubation
times etc the N M D A binding site preferentially
labeled and the pharmacological profile NMDAdisplaceable L Hglutamate binding corresponds
with that N M D A receptors obtained electrophysiological measures Previously Greenamyre
and coworkers reported that L Hglutamate bind

Previously reported that axon sprouting occurs
 the hippocampus A D patients As neuronal
cells die remaining healthy neurons sprout new connections which are postulated augment the actions
 residual fibers some cases assume the functions lost inputs For this compensatory response
 operative the postsynaptic receptors which mediate the normal synaptic functions the original circuitry must present The presence N M D A receptors AD the appropriate hippocampal subfields suggests that the corresponding circuits have
the capacity for long term potentiation and memory
formation and thus can participate hippocampal
plasticity 
N M D A receptors however are also involved 
the progression excitotoxic pathologies and
may play similar role AD The pattern hippocampal neuronal vulnerability A D has previously
been recognized similar that status epilepticus hypoxia ischemia and In animal models these latter disorders high levels 
the excitatory amino acids glutamate and aspartate
have been shown replicate the pattern
