Article abstract Hippocampal atrophy detected MRI prominent feature early Alzheimers disease AD but 
 likely that MRI underestimates the degree hippocampal neuron loss because reactive gliosis attenuates atrophy We
tested the hypothesis hippocampal N acetyl aspartate NAA neuronal marker and volume used together providcb
greater discrimination between AD and normal elderly does either measure alone We used proton MR spectroscopic
imaging H MRSI and tissue segmented and volumetric MR images measure atrophy corrected hippocampal NAA alld
volumes patients mild moderate severity and control subjects comparable age In AD atrophy corrected
NAA from the hippocampal region was reduced the right and the left both and
hippocampal volumes were smaller right and the left when compared
with control subjects The NAA reductions and volume losses made independent contributions discrimination AD
patients from control subjects When used separately neither hippocampal NAA nor volume achieved classify correctly
AD patients better than When used together however the two measures correctly classified AD patients iind
 control subjects In conclusion hippocampal NAA measured H MRSI combined with quantitative measurements hippocampal atrophy MRI may improve diagnosis AD

Neuropathologic studies brains from patients with
Alzheimers disease AD demonstrate neuritic
plaques and neurofibrillary lesions accompanied 
neuron loss and gliosis Neuron loss results atrophy the cerebral cortex and other neuroncontaining structures including the hippocampal
formation Hippocampal atrophy AD has been associated with impairment declarative memory
functions that are characteristic symptoms AD 
Previous studies AD patients using MRI found
atrophy the hippocampus Although initial
MRI study hippocampal atrophy reported complete separation AD patients from healthy elderly other studies larger numbers subjects
showed some overlap between these groups gOne
possible reason for this overlap that the degree
neurons are replaced glial cells tissue atrophy 
AD attenuated 
Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy H MRS

cerebral metabolites vivo including the amino
acid N acetyl aspartate NAA which specifically
located neurons and absent glia In the presence reactive gliosis NAA measured H MRSI

atrophy measured MRI and other ? have
documented decrease NAA various brain regions AD patients Furthermore MacKay 
who found reduced NAA the supraventricular cortex AD patients showed that these NAA reductions were some degree independent from MRI
changes and demonstrated that when N A measures were combined with measurements ventricular volumes AD patients and control subjects could
 better classified than with either measure alone 
Finally recent using multislice H MRSI

Discussion The major findings this study were
 atrophy corrected NAA concentrations were significantly lower the hippocampus AD patients
compared with control subjects comparable age 
 MRI measured hippocampal volume was also
lower AD patients compared with control subjects 
 reductions atrophy corrected hippocampal
NAA were not artifact partial volume effects 
and reductions hippocampal NAA and volume
losses provided independent information regarding
the discrimination AD from control subjects and
when used together classified AD better than either
measure alone In conclusion these findings suggest
that measurement hippocampal NAA H MRSI 
when employed conjunction with MRI may provide improved discrimination between AD patients
and control subjects and ultimately may useful 
detect AD the early stages the disease 
The first major finding this study was that NAA
was reduced the hippocampus AD patients compared with control subjects comparable age This
result consistent with previous H MRSI study
 the hippocampus AD that measured
reduced hippocampal NAAlCho and NAAlCr suggesting diminished NAA levels However the
present experiment quantitatively measured absolute NAA hippocampus and furthermore combined NAA and volume measurements improve
discrimination between AD patients and normal elderly There considerable body evidence concerning reduced NAA the brain AD patients 
Kwo On Yuen performing vitro NMR measurements AD brain tissue post mortem demonstrated reduced NAA consistent with neuron loss 
Since then there have been several reports including
those from this 
indicating
reduced
NAAlCr andfor NAAlCho AD and few quantitative H MRS measurements documenting unambiguously lower NAA A D Reports reduced
metabolite ratios have inferred that the reductions 
NAAlCr and N M C cannot simply attributed 
volume loss because simple atrophy would result 
reductions both NAA well Cho and Cr Most
previous single volume H MRS and H MRSI studies AD have been performed supraventricular
brain regions involving frontal parietal and occipital cortex and white matter These studies did not
include hippocampus even though major site
 AD pathology including neuron loss specifically 
This probably because technical problems including difficulties obtaining sufficient homogeneity 
the local static magnetic field and contamination
from lipid resonances have complicated acquisition 
spectra from medial temporal lobe and hippocampal
regions Our previous experience obtaining H MRSI
spectra from the hippocampal regions patients
with temporal lobe indicated H
MRSI the hippocampus was feasible 
The second major finding this report that
hippocampal volumes were reduced AD patients
compared with control subjects comparable age 
This finding similar several previous MRI reports which have shown volume reductions AD
patients when compared with normal
elderly In contrast the initial MRI studies hippocampal atrophy which reported complete separation between AD patients and control subjects 
the present results are similar those 
which found considerable overlap One possible explanation for this overlap that neuron loss the
hippocampus AD patients accompanied reactive gliosis which attenuates tissue atrophy resulting underestimation volume loss MRI
and consequently the failure discriminate between AD patients and normal elderly 
The third major finding this study that reductions hippocampal NAA corrected for atrophy are
not artifact differences tissue composition 
the MRSI voxels between groups In earlier study
MacKay from this laboratory using combined analysis coregistered MRI and H MRSI
data demonstrated that NAA differences measured
 supraventricular regions AD patients and control subjects existed independent variations the
tissue characteristic MRSI voxels The current results demonstrate that this observation can extended the hippocampus The current analysis
was made possible the development semiautomated segmentation and voluming software with accurate coregistration the MRI and H MRSI data 
There have been few attempt measure quantitatively metabolic changes H MRSI with consideration partial volume effects Aside from the
previous report MacKay there have been
 attempts determine statistically the extent 
which metabolic changes AD are independent
from variations the tissue characteristic MRSI
voxels 
The most important finding this study that
hippocampal NAA and volume provide independent
information regarding the discrimination between
AD patients and normal elderly This result led 
attempt use both measures improve discrimination between AD patients and control subjects depicts the distribution hippocampal NAA 
 function hippocampal volume from each subject
and demonstrates that the combination the two
measures provided better correct classification AD
patients and control subjects this study population
than either measure alone However this result does
not imply clinical applications for the diagnosis 
AD Further studies larger population especially with unselected subjects are necessary assess the diagnostic value the NAA X volume index
 comparison with that available with current clinical methods In strict sense this can achieved
only with longitudinal studies that culminate the
pathologic confirmation AD each patient also shows overlap between patients and
control subjects for both hippocampal NAA and volume measures There are several explanations for
this finding Increasing neurofibrillary tangle and neuronal with age are commonly
found hippocampal regions nondemented elderly individuals which could explain the low NAA
levels and small hippocampi some control subjects 
Another explanation for the overlap includes the possibility that the control group may have included
individuals with preclinical AD Finally the lack 
complete separation between AD patients and control subjects could also interpreted the sense 
 neurobiological continuum between norm aging
and dementia view supported findings several recent Nevertheless 
the finding 
this study that hippocampal NAA and volume provide independent information regarding the discrimination between AD patients and control subjects
supports our hypothesis that H MRSI conibination with MRI may helpful providing improved
diagnosis and early detection AD 
There are several limitations this study First 
the AD patients have not yet been followed autopsy not absolutely certain that the patients
have AD Second data from elderly patients with
dementias due causes other than AD such 
vascular dementia were not included Therefore 
 not clear whether the reduction hippocampal
NAA found AD specific for this condition However previous H MRSI studies AD and vascular dementia found metabolic abnormalities WM
regions vascular dementia but not AD HI raising the possibility that H MRSI may useful 
distinguish between these two forms dementia 
Third the major technical limitation this study
was that the spatial resolution H MRSI coarse 
and nonhippocampal structures were probably included within the MRSI voxel especially other structures the limbic lobe However these structures
are also involved with AD Furthermore this 
MRSI study was restricted the hippocampal region and did not obtain MR spectra from other areas
 the brain including the frontal parietal and temporal cortices which are also affected AD Greater
brain coverage can accomplished using multislice H MRSI instead volume preselection methods applied this study Recently Tedeschi 
 employed multislice H MRSI measure metabolite ratios from large sections frontal parietal 
and temporal lobes and thalamus AD but not
from mesial temporal lobe and hippocampus This
laboratory has also developed version multislice
H that should useful for the assessment
 AD 
Fourth increased levels myoinositol inversely
correlated with NAA changes have been rcbported 
AD using single H MRS relatively short spinecho times TE The current study was
performed TE and does not permit the
December NINJKOLOGY 
detection resonances from myoinositol which exhibits values the order less 
Development multislice H MRSI with short spinecho times accommodate simultaneous measurements NAA myoinositol and other metabolites
are currently under development Finally did not
attempt measure metabolite relaxation times T 
and because the prohibitively long duration 
the data acquisition Instead used and 
values for NAA Cr and Cho documented previous report MRS healthy elderly and applied
these values obtain approximations for metabolite concentrations AD patients and control subjects This analysis limited that ignores the
possibility T and alterations with regions
and disease To our knowledge there evidence abnormal T values AD Christiansen 
 using single volume MRS reported prolonged
 times for NAA frontal WM AD subjects
compared with control subjects If for NAA was
also prolonged the hippocampus the current measurements would have overestimated NAA AD 
and thus underestimated the differences with control
subjects 
In conclusion this report demonstrates reductions
 volume corrected NAA measure neuronal
density the hippocampus patients with AD
compared with control subjects comparable age 
These NAA reductions are statistically independent
from hippocampal volume losses and NAA taken together with volume provides better discrimination
between AD patients and control subjects than either measure alone These findings suggest 
measurement NAA H MRSI provides complementary information about loss damage neurons AD not available from measurements
 atrophy MRI Ultimately H MRSI together
with MRI may helpful providing improved diagnosis and early detection AD
