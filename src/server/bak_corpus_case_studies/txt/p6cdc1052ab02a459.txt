frontotemporal dementia glioblastoma and progressive
supranuclear palsy However the underlying neural substrate causing such alterations the viscoelastic parameters
 brain tissue not fully understood The first steps
towards correlation between viscoelastic changes and the
histopathology have been made using animal models neuropathological diseases Studies murine stroke 
and model Parkinsons have shown 
strong correlation between neuronal density and brain viscoelasticity disease related brain regions In particular MRE
was sensitive detect local cellular changes due adult
neurogenesis relatively small brain region the
hippocampus 
A progressive loss neuronal cells limbic and associated cortical areas hallmark neurodegenerative diseases such AD and associated with cognitive decline
and memory loss Growing patient numbers due the
aging society have caused rising socioeconomic costs AD
 histopathologically characterized extracellular neuritic
amyloid plaques aggregations protein 
 amino acids that first accumulates inside the
cells and then externalized into the extracellular matrix 
well intracellular neurofibrillary tangles which consist 
self assembled hyperphosphorylated tau proteins Clinical symptoms usually begin when the limbic regions are
affected mostly hippocampus and later cortex that project
 medial temporal lobe structures This causes interrupted episodic memory function resulting learning and
memory deficits Diminished recall accuracy impaired
problem solving and cognition emerge when neocortical
regions are affected By the time treatment starts the
disease has already progressed due late diagnosis Histopathologically intra and extracellular amyloid depositions
and neuronal cell loss can already found long before any
symptoms occur In addition adult hippocampal neurogenesis has been experimentally shown impaired 
the early stages AD Such histopathological changes
cannot detected early enough with conventional neuroimaging methods leading delayed diagnosis and hence
ineffective treatment At present AD can only diagnosed
 combination multiple modalities including MRI 
F fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography
 PET cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers clinical memory
tests and Amyloid PET After diagnosis medication 
increase levels glutamatergic and cholinergic neurotransmitters regular physical exercise well the involvement daily life problem solving are known decelerate
disease progression In animal studies this physical and
cognitive stimulation induced large environmentally
enriched cages ENR with changing interior arrangements
and larger animal groups This enforces constant adaptation
 new surroundings and consequently improves cognition
and social interaction Histologically ENR known 
enhance adult neurogenesis the hippocampus and 
neuroprotective AD Furthermore the correlation 
MRI brain scans humans presenting AD pathology with
high education and cognitive stimulation showed that more
challenging surroundings led increased hippocampal
volume 
So far AD still cannot cured but its progression
can slowed down even more when the disease 
detected early stage Therefore reliable preclinical
diagnosis when intracellular amyloid depositions disturb
cell homeostasis and the first changes hippocampal neurogenesis can found essential for treating AD
patients more effectively MRE has the potential become
such preclinical diagnostic tool noninvasive contrast taking cerebrospinal fluid for determining AD biomarkers and provides high sensitivity and resolution
power detect local structural changes cellular
level Therefore using MRE screening method for
patients risk the early stages cognitive impairments
 interesting prospect 
In the present study aimed correlate early histopathological changes the hippocampus and the cortex 
brain areas primarily affected early AD stages with alterations viscoelastic parameters This contributes the establishment MRE clinical tool for early diagnosis and
prognosis neurodegenerative diseases Therefore MRE was
applied female mice established and wellstudied transgenic mouse model AD three different
stages early disease progression To also investigate the
potential therapeutic effects physical and cognitive stimulation brain viscoelasticity and histopathological characteristics MRE was also applied after exposing young mice

Group Design and Experimental Procedure
Within each the and CTR group the mice were randomly cast into two different environmental modalities STD cages
 under conventional laboratory conditions Makrolon
cages and larger cages 
 for ENR Those ENR cages were equipped with
tubes cardboard boxes and plastic houses which were newly
assembled weekly for physical and cognitive enrichment In addition more mice were housed the ENR than STD cages 
 also ensure social enrichment The mice remained 
their cages for either weeks also referring adolescent young adult and adult age respectively the time analysis until MRE measurement To obtain baseline data the

MRE was performed mice aged weeks both the 
and CTR group before they were placed into their assigned cages 
In summary mice both genotypes and CTR were
housed two different cage conditions STD and ENR for three
different durations weeks resulting different

frame studied here For instance the brain deteriorates
due aging neuronal disintegration may result larger
number tissue elements which are able move 
incoherent way and thereby effectively absorb strain energy 
Such rise viscosity does not occur mice indicating disturbed masked normal modification process
 the brain least the hippocampus which probably
elicited the progressive loss neurons In addition elastic values the hippocampus adolescent mice are
lower than their healthy age matched counterparts This
also points towards very early pathological changes the
cellular level 
Furthermore elastic and viscous properties the hippocampus mice are affected differently AD
during disease progression The reduced hippocampal viscosity mice particular adult animals compared
 their healthy age matched counterparts probably due
 the diminished neuronal functionality during AD In
support this hypothesis Schwarb linked the
mechanical properties human brain tissue with functional
performance which not only depends structural but also
functional integrity the cellular network However such
early dysfunction the neurons and the network they build
needs histologically studied more detail the
 mouse model In contrast the rise elasticity
observed mice the present study may linked
 the slight but nonsignificant increased amount hippocampal neurons showing intracellular accumulation amyloid and the subsequent appearance extracellular
amyloid plaques due the externalization intracellular
amyloid Supported the significant positive correlation
 elastic values the amount cells mice
under ENR hypothesize that the elastic properties the
hippocampus are increasing because more and more neurons
accumulate amyloid before externalized into the
extracellular matrix where could also affect the mechanical integrity cells filling the interstitial space close
contact with the cells Moreover intracellular accumulation
 amyloid has been shown induce neuronal cell
death We speculate that neurons that undergo apoptosis
exhibit different biomechanical characteristics than healthy 
fully functional neurons 
In the cortex similar but clearer increase accumulating amyloid within the neurons mice over
time can found before externalized leading the
appearance extracellular amyloid plaques The appearance amyloid plaques the old this point 
 months old accordance with other studies showing that extracellular plaque formation the mouse
model starts around months age However other

than the hippocampus the slight but nonsignificant
increase cortical elasticity with age independent the
genotype Therefore amyloid accumulation the cortex
 mice cannot explicitly associated with the elasticity the cortex 
In previous study has been shown that distinct
brain areas the mouse differ their biomechanical properties The basic viscosity the midbrain was higher than
 the hippocampus which attributed the higher proportion white matter the midbrain that has been
shown stiffer than gray matter the frequency range
 MRE Here found that baseline elasticity the
hippocampus higher than that the cortex Although the
reason for these mechanical differences remains elusive 
may reflect their different anatomical structure The hippocampus has several very densely packed cellular layers with
axonal connections between whereas the cortex displays
rather loosely packed cellular layers 
In the present study also investigated the potential
therapeutic effects physical cognitive and social stimulation brain viscoelasticity and histopathological characteristics exposing mice ENR for different durations We
found that ENR was transiently effective mice 
increase the number cells the hippocampus thereby
keeping higher level than mice under STD cage
conditions However similar mice living STD reduction over time due disease progression can also observed
 ENR The higher cell numbers might due the neuroprotective effects ENR and due enhanced neurogenesis the dentate gyrus the hippocampus Those
mechanisms seem transiently counteract the progressive
cell loss until the process cell loss becomes too severe 
effectively compensated any longer Such restorative effect 
not seen the viscous elastic properties the hippocampus not even transiently In CTR mice however ENR
increases hippocampal viscosity indicating that has 
influential effect tissue mechanics As the cell numbers 
CTR contrast mice are not changed ENR 
the affected component the tissue network accounting for
the altered viscosity might different character than
just cellular Moreover this component can probably not 
influenced ENR any more any influence masked 
 mice due the disease condition 
The present study limited mice 
model for AD and female mice Further thorough studies
are required estimate brain viscoelasticity the early disease stages other animal models AD and male subjects In addition larger number mice per group should
 aimed affirm the tendencies seen here 
To summarize found that the elastic and viscous
properties hippocampal tissue are lower mice
 early disease stages compared age matched CTR mice 
For viscosity this difference becomes more pronounced with
Month 
disease progression Furthermore despite initial increase
 hippocampal cell numbers ENR exposure ENR
fails stop the progression neuronal loss and decrease 
viscosity the long term indicating that therapeutically not suitable prevent halt the changes tissue
mechanical properties AD 
In conclusion our findings support previous work that
MRE sensitive detect specific alterations viscoelasticity which occur the cellular scale brain tissue associated
with early histopathological changes due neurodegenerative
processes To our knowledge this MRE study the first 
provide evidence disease based difference hippocampal
viscosity preceding the AD characteristic extracellular Ab
pathology Our study thereby contributes the establishment
 MRE clinical tool for early diagnosis and prognosis 
neurodegenerative diseases
