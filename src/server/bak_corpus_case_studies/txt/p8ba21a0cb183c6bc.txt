INTRODUCTION
Alzheimers disease AD irreversible progressive brain disorder that slowly diminishes memory and
thinking skills and eventually results the inability 
carry out simplest tasks The underlying neuropathology
 believed begin least decade before memory and
other cognitive problems During this prodromal
stage individuals appear symptom free but significant changes are taking place the brain Abnormal
deposits proteins accumulate extracellular amyloid
plaques and tau tangles within neurons throughout the
brain The neurons become dysfunctional lose synaptic
connections with other neurons and ultimately undergo
cell death The damage initially appears take place 
the hippocampus important node the neural network
that forms memories As more neurons die additional
parts the brain are affected and brain atrophy occurs 
By the final stage Alzheimers damage widespread 
and brain tissue has shrunk significantly 
Microneedle stimulation acupuncture has been used
 relieve pain China for millennia Many diseases 
the central nervous system CNS could not treated
 this method because inaccessibility the brain 
 microneedle In the last decade deep brain stimulation
 DBS through chronically implanted metal electrodes
into specific brain regions has become common therapeutic choice for refractory movement disorders such 
Parkinsons disease PD tremors and dystonia reviewed
 More recently DBS has been applied psychiatric
and behavioral disorders including depression obsessive
compulsive disorder OCD addiction and most recently 
for disorders Long term implantation fine metal electrode even without chronic electrical stimulation may produce unwanted effects such
 mild severe inflammatory responses microhemorrhages and Neuropathological examination

RAWM Test
The RAWM task designed test spatial learning
and memory and was originally developed test animals
ability navigate specific location place learning 
however can easily adapted test spatial working
memory This task hippocampal dependent and highly
sensitive hippocampal functional integrity although
other brain structures such the prefrontal cortex and
basal forebrain are important The RAWM was administered baseline before stereotaxic surgery and weeks
after microneedle insertion and removal For baseline
performance mice were tested for consecutive days 
the RAWM task and then the Tg mice were divided into
two groups one received transient insertion micro
needle the dorsum the hippocampus and the other
mice underwent sham surgery penetration calvarium Four weeks after microneedle stimulation sham
surgery all mice were retested the RAWM for consecutive days For RAWM testing aluminum insert was
introduced into pool order divide the pool
into six equally spaced swim arms length 
width radiating from central circular swim area 
diameter The insert extended above the surface 
the water allowing the mice easily view surrounding
visual cues which were generously placed outside the
MICRONEEDLE STIMULATES HIPPOCAMPAL NEUROGENESIS
pool Visual spatial cues consisted large brightly colored
two dimensional D and D objects including beach
ball poster and inflatable pool toys During testing the
pool water was maintained C In one the arms 
 transparent submerged escape platform was placed
 below the water near the wall end Each mouse was
given five min trials per day The last the four consecutive acquisition trials trial and min delayed
retention trial are indices working memory On any
given day the escape platform location was placed the
end one the six arms with the platform moved 
 different arm semirandom fashion for each day 
testing In contrast the stationary platform the Morris
water maze moving the escape platform forced the animal
 learn new platform location daily thereby evaluating
working memory On each day different start arms for each
 the five daily trials were selected from the remaining
five swim arms semirandom sequence that involved
all five arms For any given trial the mouse was placed
into that trials start arm facing the center swim area and
given find the platform When the mouse made 
incorrect choice was gently pulled back that trials
start arm and error was recorded An error was also
recorded the mouse failed make choice 
which case was returned that trails start arm the
animal entered the platform containing arm but failed 
locate the platform A stay was given once the mouse
had found the platform If the mouse did not find the platform within trial was guided the experimenter
 the platform allowed stay for and was assigned

Tissue Preparation and Sectioning
Six mice from each group nontransgenic NT controls month old Tg APP mice treated with micro
needle and month old Tg APP mice that had
sham surgery underwent histological analyses determine the extent neurogenesis the hippocampus and
Ab reduction After completion the RAWM weeks
after needle stimulation mice were anesthetized with
 chloral hydrate Sigma Aldrich and transcardiac
perfusion the brain with saline and 
 paraformaldehyde PFA Sigma Aldrich was done 
The brain was removed and fixed for the same
solution After fixing the brains were immersed overnight sucrose PFA PBS Sigma Aldrich 
Thirty micrometer thick frozen sections through the hippocampus were prepared and stored vials containing 
cryopreservation solution 
Immunohistochemistry
Selective immunostaining astrocytes and microglia
was performed with antibodies glial fibrillary acidic
Quantitative Image Analysis Amyloid Burden
Images were acquired magnification 
 digitized tagged image format files TIFF retain
maximum resolution using Olympus microscope with attached digital camera system 
Olympus Tokyo Japan Images six thick
sections apart from each mouse were captured
from serially sectioned hippocampi both the left and
right sides Using ImageJ software National Institutes
 Health NIH Bethesda MD USA the red channel
 for the amyloid stain was selected and converted into 
monochrome signal Then threshold optical density was
obtained that discriminated staining from background 
The thresholded signal was quantified percent the
visual field for each image Data were reported the percentage labeled area captured positive pixels divided
 the full area captured total pixels The fluorescence
signals from each mouse hippocampus separate analyses for each side were averaged and used calculate
the mean signal the visual field for each group
 mice 
As surrogate index neurogenesis the expression
 DCX marker immature was measured
 the DG hippocampi using the approach described
above Bias was eliminated using blinded examiner
who analyzed the region interest ROI represented 
the sampling six sections per mouse DG the right
side and six sections the left side Each analysis was
done single examiner blinded sample identities 
In addition semiautomatically measuring DCX signal described above for the amyloid measurements 
 unbiased estimate the number DCX cells 
the DG was performed coded sections previously
 Briefly double labeled cells BrdU cells
that coexpressed DCX were counted every sixth section each section separated using modification the optical dissector method cells the upper
and lower planes were not counted avoid counting partial cells Resulting numbers were tallied and multiplied
 tissue thickness and the number intervening sections 
Data Analysis
A summary RAWM data was prepared determining the mean error score for trials and The
RAWM data were analyzed using both two way repeatedmeasures analysis variance ANOVA and one way
ANOVAs Tests comparing treatment groups against
NT controls trial were run followed correction
for multiple comparisons Sidaks multiple comparisons
test Analysis histological data comparing the lesioned
side the unlesioned side utilized unpaired tests with
equal variances GraphPad Prism version for Mac
OS GraphPad Software La Jolla CA USA 
RESULTS
The RAWM was administered baseline before
stereotaxic surgery and weeks after brief stereotaxic
insertion and removal microneedle that targeted dorsal hippocampi the right side the brain The microlesioned Tg APP mice exhibited reduction 
errors compared the nonlesioned Tg APP mice
 the delayed memory retention trial trial Fig C 
Two way ANOVA the data showed that trial number 
but not treatment lesion lesion contributed significantly total variation One way analysis trial 
data followed tests with correction for multiple comparisons showed that both lesioned and nonlesioned Tg
animals were significantly different than the NT lesioned
mice Although the data suggested improved performance the lesioned Tg mice compared the nonlesioned Tg mice Fig C these results did not reach
statistical significance 
Seven weeks after the surgery and after the last RAWM
test the animals were euthanized and amyloid burden was
determined Fig Simple insertion and removal the
needle triggered repair response which the Ab signal
was reduced over period weeks greater than 
 the region In addition the GFP cells around
and within amyloid plaques were increased greater than
twofold Fig D These mice had been transplanted with
SONG ET AL 
GFP bone marrow months age Hence the GFP
cells that decorate the Ab plaques are derived from circulating GFP blood cells Many GFP cells coexpress 
indicating these cells have differentiated into microglia
 data not shown The recruitment GFP bone marrow
cells the site the lesion and their differentiation into
 microglia have been reported earlier microlesion study normal Moreover the microlesion
resulted increased hippocampal astrocytosis GFAP
signal data not shown reported the earlier study 
In addition decreased amyloid burden the microlesion promoted hippocampal neurogenesis Fig The
DCX signal marker immature neurons the SGZ 
was significantly increased the microneedle stimulation the right dorsal hippocampus compared the
untreated side Estimates numbers newborn neurons
 numbers DCX cells that were labeled birth with
BrdU confirmed significant increase double labeled

DISCUSSION
Focal microlesions the hippocampus produced 
transient insertion and removal microneedle 
transgenic mouse model AD was effective decreasing amyloid burden and increasing neurogenesis Similar
results reduction amyloid burden and promotion

observed following course granulocyte colonystimulating factor G CSF treatment the same transgenic mouse model Following course G CSF
treatment both young and old Tg APP mice the
therapeutic effect amyloid reduction was associated
with improved performance the RAWM similar the
effects microlesioning the hippocampus reported
here More recently microlesions the hippocampus
 young BL J mice were reported promote hippocampal neurogenesis and increase total microgliosis
and In that microlesion study significant proportion the microglia were derived
from circulating monocytes A cascade cytokine and
chemokine release appeared play role recruitment
 monocytes into the brain where they differentiated into
In the present study there was attempt 
characterize the phenotype the GFP cells However 
 the basis our earlier work likely that GFP
cells decorating the amyloid plaques were recruited the
site the lesion where they differentiated into microglia
expressing It assumed that increased macrophage
activity the newly recruited microglia promotes clearance plaques Interventions that decrease the amyloid
burden have been demonstrated improve performance

data analysis was performed trial C Mean number errors plotted against treatment trial One way ANOVA followed tests with multiple comparisons revealed
that all means trial differed from the NT control The lesioned Tg mice exhibited reduction errors than nonlesioned Tg mice but the difference did
not reach statistical significance
