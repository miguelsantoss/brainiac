ABSTRACT
The volume the temporal lobe superior temporal gyrus amygdala and hippocampus
was quantified from magnetic images the brains healthy children and adolescents aged
 years Variability volume was high for all structures examined When adjusted for 
larger total cerebral volume males there were significant volume differences between
sexes However sex specific maturational changes were noted the volumes medial
temporal structures with the left amygdala increasing significantly only males and with the
right hippocampus increasing significantly only females Right greater than left laterality
effects were found for temporal lobe superior temporal gyrus amygdala and hippocampal
volumes These results are consistent with previous preclinical and human studies that have
indicated hormonal responsivity these structures and extend quantitative morphologic
findings from the adult literature In addition highlighting the need for large samples and
sex matched controls pediatric neuroimaging studies the information from this understudied age group may use evaluating developmental hypotheses neuropsychiatric

To our knowledge however vivo quantitative morphologic studies these structures have been carried out for
children and adolescents I one the few postmortem

With the use magnetic resonance imaging MRI 
studies normal aging adults have indicated maturational changes for the temporal lobe and for medial temporal structures which part are sex specific For instance 
 recent study comparing brain morphology subjects
aged years that subjects aged years
found age related decreases the amygdala for males and
females but found decrease the hippocampus for
females only Murphy A study comparing
temporal lobe measures subjects aged years 
those subjects aged years found decrease

However these results may reflect processes the extreme
end the aging process A recent study that included 
healthy adults aged years reported larger superior

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge this the first large normative 
morphologic study the temporal lobe and related medial
temporal structures children and adolescents All the
structures that were measured demonstrated high degree
 variability Total temporal lobe volume was stable while
amygdala volume increased only males and hippocampal volume increased only females This pattern 
consistent with the distribution sex hormone receptors
for these structures with the amygdala having predominance androgen receptors Clark Sholl and
Kim and the hippocampus having predominance 
estrogen receptors Morse 
The hormonal responsivity the hippocampus females supported well both animal and human studies 
Gonadectomized adult female rats have decreased fiber
outgrowth and altered density dendritic spines the
hippocampus which can reversed with hormone replacement Morse Gould In humans 
women with gonadal hypoplasia were also noted have
decreased hippocampal volume Murphy 
The increase hippocampal volume females consistent with postmortem study Benes 
psychiatrically normal individuals newborn age 
years showing that myelination the subicular and
presubicular regions the hippocampus continue throughout adolescence and into adulthood When adjusted for total
brain weight the area myelination doubled between the
first and second decades this key relay zone A sexually
dimorphic effect was also noted with females who showed 
greater degree myelin staining during the interval 
 years but showed significant differences thereafter 
This consistent with recent MRI study young
adults showing proportionately larger hippocampal volumes females Filipek 
In addition receptors for gonadal steroids the hippocampus and amygdala are rich receptors for adrenal
steroids thyroid hormone and nerve growth factor
 Gould Amaral As well its direct
effects hippocampal development estrogen may influence development blocking the neurodegenerative effects glucocorticoids Sapolsky Miller 
 Sapolsky The diversity afferent and efferent connections the many distinct nuclei 
the amygdala and the hippocampus well the complexity their various neurochemical systems make the prediction functional correlates gross volume changes difficult 
Several limitations this study should noted First 
the use internal medial landmarks the mammillary
bodies define structural boundaries does not consider
cytoarchitectonic sulcaligyral information With regard
 rightileft asymmetries the right cerebral hemisphere
tends shifted anteriorly compared the left Bilder 
 and this would favor the observed right greaterthan left asymmetries the amygdala superior temporal
gyrus and temporal lobe 
This phenomenon however would not account for 
right greater than left hippocampal volume because the
posterior boundary the hippocampus ascending fibers 
the crux the fornix was determined per hemisphere
basis and the location the boundary between the amygdala and the hippocampus farther posteriorly the right
should serve decrease the relative size the right
hippocampus The use sulcal and gyral landmarks 
three dimensional reconstructed images define these
structures would preferable because would more
sensitive developmental changes the Sylvian fissure
and the inferior sulcus the superior temporal gyrus and
 would provide more valid index asymmetry This
further analysis planned 
The interpretation volumetric changes complicated
 the myriad factors contributing structure size 
including the number and size neurons and glial cells 
packing density vascularity and matrix composition These
parameters turn are affected genetics environment 
hormones growth factors and nutrients the developing
nervous system Diamond Jacobson 
Despite this complexity there are suggestions relationship between hippocampal size and memory function 
birds where food storing species have larger hippocampal
volumes than related species nonfood storing birds Krebs
 Sherry Mammals also show 
relationship between spatial memory and hippocampal size
 Sherry For instance males polygamous
vole species that explore large areas search mates and
that perform better laboratory measures spatial
ability have significantly larger relative hippocampal volumes than their female counterparts This sexual dimorphism hippocampal size not seen the monogamous
vole species which does not show male female differences
 spatial ability Jacobs Such relationships
are less striking humans although correlations between
left hippocampus volume and memory for stories have been
noted Lencz Goldberget 
The stability the total temporal lobe volume with age
for our sample mirrors findings from the adult literature 
which temporal lobe volumes decrease much slower
rate than other brain regions Coffey Murphy
 However stability over time gross size 
structure may not sensitive qualitative changes
