Dementia increasingly common disorder which affects
 the general population older than years and

 diagnosing this disorder lies particularly its
pharmacological management with good responsiveness 
cholinesterase but extreme sensitivity the sideeffects neuroleptic drugs DLB has had several
diagnostic labels during the past decade including diffuse
Lewy body disease Lewy body dementia the Lewy body
variant Alzheimers disease senile dementia Lewybody type and dementia associated with cortical Lewy
bodies Close clinical and pathological similarities are now
being recognised between DLB and dementia that occurs

In effort review and clarify current knowledge 
concepts and methods for further inquiry specialist
meeting was organised the International Psychogeriatric
THE LANCET Neurology Vol January 
Association with the participation the European
Movement Disorder Society Participants were asked 
review relevant literature systematically and discuss As 
product this international meeting have reviewed the
current state scientific knowledge about DLB and
identified key issues requiring clarification and research
necessary advance knowledge this area Articles for
inclusion were selected the authors representing the
most relevant and important work and supplemented the

meeting 
Diagnostic concepts
DLB and PDD are clinically defined syndromes although
consensus clinical criteria have been validated for DLB 
formal clinical diagnostic criteria have been proposed 
validated for PDD the subject recent comprehensive
review this journal An arbitrary year rule has until
now been used separate DLB from PDD onset 
dementia within months parkinsonism qualifies 
DLB and more than months parkinsonism before
dementia PDD The limitations this approach are
discussed later 
At autopsy cases both disorders have Lewy bodies 
which are the characteristic pathological feature Lewybody disease but there are yet definite pathological
criteria that separate the disorders either from each other

autopsy studies patients with clinically diagnosed DLB

uncertainties and difficulties clinical ascertainment 
routine sources information such death certificates and
 limited number population based studies leave
uncertainty about the relative frequencies DLB and PDD 
In population based clinical studies people aged years
 older the prevalences DLB and PDD were reported

Psychiatric
Psychiatric manifestations are common DLB
predominantly visual hallucinations delusions apathy and
anxiety They are generally present early the course 
illness and may the initial reason for referral They also
tend persist for example hallucinations were stable 
placebo treated DLB group over and cohort 
which the disorder took its natural course over weeks The
hallucinations are similar those reported PDD that
they are vivid colourful three dimensional and generally
mute images animate objects Barnes and 
suggested that the hallucinations arise from combination 
faulty perceptual processing environmental stimuli and less
detailed recollection experience combined with intact
image generation The importance psychiatric symptoms 
the clinical phenomenology DLB such that cluster 
hallucinations delusions apathy and depression derived
from the neuropsychiatric was used the primary
outcome the first randomised placebo controlled study 
DLB treatment Visual hallucinations are associated with
greater deficits cortical and predict better
response cholinesterase inhibitors 
Neurological
Extrapyramidal signs are reported patients
with DLB diagnosis and most develop some such signs
THE LANCET Neurology Vol January 
during the natural course In autopsyconfirmed cases however there may record 
extrapyramidal signs which shows that parkinsonism not
necessary for clinical diagnosis DLB Indeed the main
reason for missing DLB clinically prospective
clinicopathological study was the absence extrapyramidal
signs The next most common reason for missing the
diagnosis was the suspicion cerebrovascular disease 
Initial suggestions that parkinsonism DLB mild have
not been supported studies finding severity equal that
 non demented patients with Parkinsons and
similar annual progression rates motor scores the
unified Parkinsons disease rating scale The pattern 
extrapyramidal signs DLB shows axial biaseg greater
postural instability and facial impassivity with tendency
towards less tremor consistent with greater nondopaminergic motor involvement The parkinsonism
phenotype postural instabilitygait overrepresented DLB also PDD whereas tremordominant and postural instability gait difficulty subtypes
were evenly distributed non demented group with

disease PDD and DLB may thus continuum with 
shift towards greater non dopaminergic motor system

Autonomic failure
Autonomic abnormalities including orthostatic hypotension
and carotid sinus hypersensitivity are more common 
patients with DLB than those with Alzheimers disease 
 age matched controls Clinical presentation DLB 
commonly with dizziness presyncope syncope and
falls and autonomic dysfunction risk factor for falls 
 these cases through either orthostatic hypotension
 carotid sinus hypersensitivity Urinary incontinence has
been reported early the course DLB compared with
Alzheimers disease 
Disease progression and survival
There conflicting evidence from comparative studies with
Alzheimers disease about both symptom progression and
survival DLB Most data have been obtained
retrospectively The most parsimonious explanation from
the available findings that there difference 
progression between DLB and Alzheimers disease but
mean values from large studies could conceal disease
heterogeneity and some patients with DLB have very rapid
disease course The conclusion that either there 
difference between DLB and Alzheimers disease survival
from onset until death that survival worse DLB 
Whether there are any specific features such more severe
extrapyramidal signs frequent falls that are associated
with more rapid disease progression poorer survival not
yet known 
Clinical diagnosis DLB
DLB can initially present general practitioners geriatric
psychiatrists movement disorder specialists emergency
services As with all dementias accurate clinical diagnosis
can only made after thorough clinical assessment
including detailed history from the patient and 
informant and full mental state cognitive and physical
 including neurological examinations There should 
particular emphasis eliciting the core diagnostic
features
fluctuating
cognitive
impairment 
parkinsonism and recurrent visual hallucinations and the
supportive features falls depression other
hallucinations and REM sleep disorder Diagnosis should
 made the basis the consensus diagnostic criteria
for DLB panel which are the most widely accepted and
have been the best validated autopsy The main
differential diagnoses are Alzheimers disease vascular
dementia PDD atypical parkinsonian syndromes such 
progressive supranuclear palsy multiple system atrophy 
and corticobasal degeneration and Creutzfeldt Jakob
disease 
Several retrospective and two prospective studies have
examined the predictive accuracy clinical criteria for
probable table They show that sensitivity 
variable and although high one prospective study was
unacceptably low several other studies By contrast 
specificity generally high There therefore need 
develop ways improving the sensitivity the diagnosis 
DLB without loss specificity which may ultimately
require biological test 
Consistent application and greater inter rater reliability
 the consensus criteria would facilitated more
detailed definitions the quality frequency and severity 
core and supportive features The assessment fluctuating
cognitive impairment poses substantial difficulty many
clinicians and newly proposed rating scales could 
particularly helpful this regard The best way take
advantage supportive diagnostic features panel 
improving diagnostic accuracy also needs identified 
Repeated falls syncope transient loss consciousness and
depression are common older people with cognitive
impairment and can serve red flags possible
diagnosis DLB By contrast neuroleptic sensitivity and
REM sleep behaviour disorder can highly predictive 
DLB but their detection depends the clinicians having 
high index suspicion and asking appropriate screening
questions 
Since PDD common and typically shares the features
 DLB there much debate about the relation between
the two disorders There are present specific
operational clinical criteria diagnose PDD The criteria
 Diseases and Statistical Manual IV are incomplete and
descriptive and not describe several core clinical
features associated with dementia Parkinsons disease 
The arbitrary year rule used separate DLB from PDD
 helpful individual case diagnosis but increasingly
hard justify from neurobiological point view 
Current DLB criteria therefore need revisited with
respect their relation PDD this process would 
facilitated improved operational criteria for PDD The
need for collaborative research effort specialists 
movement disorders and dementia apparent and 
already being addressed interdisciplinary task groups

Dementia with Lewy bodies
Management DLB
A four stage approach the management DLB has been
described accurate diagnosis identification target
symptoms with patient and carer non pharmacological
interventions and pharmacological interventions Target
symptoms can include extrapyramidal motor features 
cognitive impairment neuropsychiatric features including
hallucinations depression sleep disorder and associated
behavioural disturbances autonomic dysfunction 
Patients carers and clinicians can differ their
prioritisation which symptoms need treating and all
must understand the potential for gains one domain may
 the expense losses another 
Non pharmacological interventions are humane way
 treating people with dementia and have the potential 
address most the areas which there are management
difficulties DLB They require general set caregiving
skills well tailoring interventions the patient carer 
and environment A systematic analysis nonpharmacological approaches DLB and evaluation the
system changes and costs that are needed support them 
clinical practice have yet done 
The evidence base for pharmacological management 
DLB also limited but there general agreement that 
antiparkinsonian drugs are prescribed the clinician should
aim for the lowest acceptable dose levodopa
monotherapy The effectiveness levodopa motor
symptoms DLB has not been established but probably
less than uncomplicated Parkinsons disease possibly
because there additional intrinsic striatal pathology and
dysfunction receptor antagonists particularly
traditional neuroleptic agents can provoke severe
neuroleptic sensitivity reactions DLB
patients with increase mortality two three times 
New atypical antipsychotic drugs used low dose are safer
 this regard but sensitivity reactions have been
documented with most and they should used with great
caution 
There consistent evidence that cholinesterase
inhibitors are more effective DLB than Alzheimers
disease for which they were originally developed 
Fluctuating cognitive impairments visual hallucinations 
apathy anxiety and sleep disturbance are significantly
improved with cholinesterase inhibitors used the typical
dose range for Alzheimers disease In addition the usual
gastrointestinal side effects associated with this class drug 
increased cholinergic activity may cause hypersalivation and
exacerbate postural hypotension and falls patients with
DLB Cholinesterase inhibitors are deemed some 
first line treatment for the cognitive and psychiatric
symptoms DLB although there have been only two
double blind placebo controlled studies that addressed their
symptomatic and very limited open label data 
long term effects No information yet available about
their use combination with antiparkinsonian atypical
antipsychotic agents although these are both common

for use DLB but none have been attempted far DLB 
particularly attractive target for neuroprotection owing 
the presence significant neuronal dysfunction but 
striking cortical neuronal degeneration In vitro and animal
models synuclein aggregation and its relation 
amyloid deposition will useful tools for developing novel
disease modifying therapies for DLB 
Trial designs and regulatory issues
There are treatments licensed for DLB Regulatory
authorities seem prepared accept DLB indication for
regulatory approval pharmacological treatment 
condition that its existence widely accepted experts 
that can operationally defined reliable and valid
criteria and that outcomes for studies use validated and
standardised outcome measures The US Food and Drug
Administration has considered DLB indication and
initially has suggested that there dual primary outcomes 
namely global and specified measure cognition 
Cognitive outcome measures from clinical trials 
Alzheimers disease that are predominantly memory based
need not necessarily used DLB studies and more
appropriate instruments should considered The
acceptability primary behavioural outcome measure 
DLB clinical trials has not yet been clarified Potential
confounding factors for global and functional scales DLB
include the additional disabilities arising from motor
disability and for all outcome measures the inherent
fluctuations the untreated illness 
Trial designs
Few DLB treatment trials have been reported partly because
the disorder was only recently described but also because 
restricted expertise clinical diagnosis The current
approach address DLB and PDD separately but the
close relation these disorders and the logistics 
recruitment provide the opportunity for both populations 
patients enter into single clinical trial with harmonised
set entry criteria Post hoc subanalysis could used 
assess for differential responses Recruitment patients into
such trials will require specialised movement disorder and
dementia referral clinics participate with anticipated
slower accrual only patients with DLB are recruited In
view the small number randomised controlled trials 
either DLB PDD the use placebos still judged ethical 
but note that cholinesterase inhibitors are already 
widespread use some countries 
Outcome measures
Specific measures attention and cognitive fluctuation 
which are both part the clinical profile DLB and PDD 
are sensitive response treatment intervention Other
key domains executive functioning visual perception and
memory systems must also measured The most
important neuropsychiatric target symptoms include visual
hallucinations delusions delusional misidentification 
apathy anxiety and depression The desired behavioural
outcomes might reduction both the intensity and
frequency these key behavioural symptoms with effect

Global awareness DLB and educational and
treatment needs
Most dementia research has been done North America 
Australia and Europe but even these regions awareness
 DLB only now becoming widespread within specialist
care In countries with less developed dementia services and
with greater reliance primary care there are substantial
difficulties translating current methods case detection
and diagnosiseg administration cognitive tests 
patients who are illiterate have little education In most
cultures dementia has been regarded normal part 
ageing and patients are brought for help only when
behaviour becomes troublesome Such patients could
include those with DLB and accurate diagnosis imperative
 avoid increased morbidity and mortality from the
inappropriate use neuroleptic agents and ensure that
they are not denied access cholinesterase inhibitors and
other interventions that might beneficial The first goal
must raise awareness Possible strategies address
these problems the parts the world that have the most
rapidly expanding elderly populations include combining
efforts with international and regional organisations for
Parkinsons disease and Alzheimers disease include DLB
 their educational campaigns develop appropriate
educational materials and disseminate these through
accessible internet sites that are linked with existing Lewybody disease resources 
Conclusions
DLB one group neurodegenerative disorders that
has been characterised the synucleinopathies The
group includes Parkinsons disease with and without
dementia and primary autonomic failure Clinical criteria
and assessment scales for the accurate diagnosis DLB have
been developed the past decade and these are useful 
the differentiation DLB from other dementia subtypes 
particularly Alzheimers disease and vascular cognitive
impairment But diagnostic accuracy DLB still needs 
improved Progress may difficult given the inevitable
pathological heterogeneity that occurs the ageing brain 
Many patients with DLB have substantial additional
pathology that modifies the core clinical features and makes
those cases difficult recognise existing clinical methods 
Some modifications the application existing diagnostic
criteria could help increase case detection For example 
clinicians assessing elderly patients with cognitive
dysfunction should routinely asking about features that
support DLB diagnosis such REM sleep behaviour
disorder repeated falls neuroleptic sensitivity Existing
clinical methods and criteria need more widely
disseminated with the message that patients with DLB can
respond well cholinergic treatment and extremely badly
 neuroleptic drugs A biological diagnostic marker 
urgently required Functional neuroimaging the
dopaminergic system could soon provide such marker 
aiding the distinction between DLB and dementias that lack
nigrostriatal dopaminergic degeneration 
A different approach required address the
distinction between DLB and PDD These syndromes could
 similar biological level that categorical distinction
 inappropriate and the use generic term such Lewybody disease synucleinopathy for all cases might 
preferable But such terms imply prior knowledge the
underlying pathology and the absence this 
diagnosticians might additionally need use diagnostic
terms DLB PDD that describe the individual patients
clinical presentation taking into consideration both the
temporal sequence symptom onset and their relative
severity 
No rigorously tested treatment algorithms for DLB have
been published and some basic information still lacking 
for example the responsiveness parkinsonian features 
levodopa Avoidance neuroleptic agents important 
Long term use cholinesterase inhibitors seems 
helpful for neuropsychiatric and cognitive symptoms but
further clinical trials are needed clarify how these agents
should used and identify their side effect profile this
population When disease modifying agents are developed
for Parkinsons disease Alzheimers disease they should
 tried DLB and PDD also Virtually unrecognised 
years ago DLB could within this decade one the most
treatable neurodegenerative disorders late life
