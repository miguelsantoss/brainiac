Results and discussion
 On chip magnetic eld gradients
There are basically four chip magnetic fields considered the externally applied field the attracting field
produced current passing through the tapered current lines 
 iii the smaller attracting field produced the current passing through the sensor and the fringe field the label 
The applied field was constant across the chip surface while
the latter three fields were local The magnetic nanoparticles
act both detectable labels via their fringe field and 
biomolecular carriers means transporting the
target DNA molecules via the attracting field produced 
the current lines and lesser degree the smaller attract 
ing field the sensor itself The applied field regulated
through the current applied external electromagnet positioned over the chip This used both induce overall
moment the magnetic nanoparticles align the small
random moments the iron oxide create detectable
fringe field and also bias the sensor within the linear regime
 its magnetoresistive magnetic field response curve 
The field produced the current lines depends the magnitude the current and the current density The current density
 highest were the line dimensions are the smallest the
narrow regions the tapered lines either side the sensor
 shown the solid blue regions Fig Consequently 
when current sufficient magnitude mA passed
through one both lines magnetic field energy profile 
produced that favours the movement the magnetic labels 
the narrow regions the line The current through the sensor
 mA also produces attracting magnetic field albeit
smaller than the field produced the current line Hence 
when current flows through the lines the magnetic labels are
rapidly attracted the narrow regions the lines force
 and when the current switched off the particles are
then attracted the nearby sensor force represented schematically Fig Thus either one both lines
can used simple means rapidly saturate the sensor
surface with the nucleic acid functionalized magnetic labels 
Real images taken from video recording made during 
experiment which one line was used focus and detect
 magnetic particles are shown Fig 
 Hybridisation experiments with magnetically
labelled target DNA
Hybridisation experiments were performed cycles 
each cycle consisting four stages introducing the
Fig A schematic representation the operational principles the tapered current line structures with magnetoresistive spin valve sensor When mA
 passed through both current lines either side the sensor central magnetic field gradient generated resulting magnetic force that attracts the
magnetic labels the narrow regions the current lines When sufficient number labels have been concentrated the current lines the current switched
off and the magnetic labels are then attracted the nearby sensor magnetic force resulting from the smaller magnetic field generated the current
 mA through the sensor Thus high concentrations magnetically labelled target DNA are rapidly brought into close contact with sensor bound probe DNA

magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with complementary target DNA 
 current mA was passed through both tapered current

 mV was obtained using magnetically labelled complementary target DNA Fig No binding signal was
obtained for magnetically labelled non complementary target
DNA Fig However this did not establish whether further hybridisation the magnetically labelled complementary target DNA would occur more extended timescale 
Consequently experiments were performed employing two
 three sequential cycles sensor saturation and washing 
The results obtained using only one tapered current line

again only magnetically labelled complementary target DNA
gave rise binding signals The first experimental cycle

 switching off the current through both current lines effectively saturate the sensor with functionalized nanoparticles and washing the chip
and sensor surface with buffer Note with magnetic nanoparticles functionalized with complementary target DNA binding signal obtained after
each washing step The hybridisation signal increases from mV after
one hybridisation cycle mV after two cycles and then mV after
three cycles 
resulted binding signal mV which increased
 mV after second cycle and then mV after third cycle Fig Calculations based signal
per label suggest that this binding signal represents 
nanoparticles representing surface coverage the
sensor It was calculated that full monolayer nanoparticles across the sensor surface nanoparticles would
result signal mV which point further increases the binding signal would expected In practice 
 sensor coverage with nanoparticles would difficult
 attain due steric hindrance the binding surface The
absence binding signals with magnetically labelled noncomplementary target DNA indicated negligible level 
non specific binding either with the probe DNA with the
sensor surface 
The determination the number target DNA molecules
attached each magnetic nanoparticle was based the
binding one DNA molecule via the end biotin 
each streptavidin molecule the nanoparticle surface The
number streptavidin molecules immobilised per nanoparticle was calculated using the total weight streptavidin
measured for known bulk quantity nanoparticles The
number particle bound target DNA molecules interacting with the probe DNA molecules above the sensor surface
was then estimated considering arc the particle
 contact with the sensor surface This estimate was based
 several assumptions the nanoparticle has spherical
shape the streptavidin molecules are evenly distributed
across the surface the nanoparticle and iii the contact distance height between the sensor surface and the arc 
the particle must not exceed the length the probe DNA
and cross linker attached the sensor surface 
When applied Nanomag D particles with diameter
 and radius was estimated that
 streptavidin molecules were distributed across surface area Therefore arc the
particle contact with the sensor surface represented target DNA molecules interacting with
sensor bound probe DNA molecules The MR sensor signal resulting from single magnetic nanoparticle bound the
sensor surface was estimated V using the magnetic
moment the particle measured under the same experimental conditions employed during the detection process On
this basis the DNA detection range single 
sensor was calculated molecules equivalent
 fmole Fig The range DNA concentrations that could analysed chip vary considerably
 this depends the number DNA molecules attached
 each magnetic label In principle one DNA molecule

 calibration curve not shown for resistance versus temperature between
 and C A cross section through the chip the region single
sensor showing the distance the sensor from the two associated current
line structures The temperature change T calculated above the chip resulted from heating contributions from the current through the sensor itself
and the current passing through one both current lines 
was attached each nanoparticle then extremely low target DNA concentrations could used However this approach would unlikely result efficient hybridisation the sensor surface the nanoparticles would have
 the correct orientation bind the probe DNA 
In practical terms using reasonable number target DNA
molecules per label anticipated that target DNA
concentrations the femto molar range could analysed

 On chip temperatures the sensor site
All the chip hybridisation experiments were performed room temperature Nevertheless the heat generated
 chip structures during experiment may important
 temperature changes may affect the sensor signal and may
also affect biomolecular recognition processes such hybridisation and dehybridisation The temperature generated
depends mainly the magnitude the currents used and
the nature and the thickness the insulating passivating layers above and below the sensor line structure A
calibration sensor resistance versus temperature was performed and this was used measure the sensors thermal
coefficient resistivity R T C 
where the room temperature resistance This was then
used calculate the temperature change corresponding

negative sense currents between and mA Fig

configuration applying magnetizing field Oe The
temperature change observed with increase current was
almost instantaneous with negligible temperature increase
observed over the following min At mA the sense current used the DNA hybridisation detection experiments 
the maximum temperature change was measured C 
resulting sensor surface temperature C without fluid based heat dissipation considerations this temperature was close the optimal temperature for the chip
DNADNA hybridisation and well below the dissociation
temperature the CFTR targetprobe DNA The melting
point calculated for the probe was C according 
although this does not take into account the DNA concentration and medium composition above the sensor surface A
similar temperature calculation using the sensors resistance
response was made for different currents passed through the
two associated current lines distance each side
 the sensor Fig The heat generated above the sensor result current mA passed through both
associated current lines was found increase the temperature the sensor site more than C over min
