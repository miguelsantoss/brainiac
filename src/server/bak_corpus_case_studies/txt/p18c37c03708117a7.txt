Over the past five years magnetoelectronics has
emerged promising new platform technology for
biosensor and biochip development The techniques
are based the detection the magnetic fringe field
 magnetically labeled biomolecule interacting with
 complementary biomolecule bound magneticfield sensor Magnetoresistive based sensors conventionally used read heads hard disk drives have
been used combination with biologically functionalized magnetic labels demonstrate the detection 
molecular recognition Real world bio applications are
now being investigated enabling tailored device
design based sensor and label characteristics This
detection platform provides robust inexpensive sensing technique with high sensitivity and considerable
scope for quantitative signal data enabling magnetoresistive biochips meet specific diagnostic needs that
are not met existing technologies 
Despite the success fluorescence based microarrays 
biomedical research the investigation novel biochip
platforms continues driven the huge market
potential for bio detection systems offering unique advantages reduced cost The technical challenges that still
face fluorescence based DNA microarray systems include
 lack quantitative analysis the difficulty encountered
 comparing data collected from different microarray
platforms and the often prohibitively high cost associated equipment such array scanners The detection
platform suffers from high background fluorescence from
microarray substrates and would also benefit from the use
 more stable biological labels fluorescent labels are
photo sensitive and hence samples bleach when exposed
 light Since the late magnetoelectronics has
emerged one several new platform technologies for
biosensor and biochip development This technology 
based the detection biologically functionalized
micrometer nanometer sized magnetic labels using
high sensitivity microfabricated magnetic field sensors 
Although its infancy this technology offers highsensitivity detection the level single molecular

Magnetic field biosensor detection schemes
In the simplest most direct case the biomolecule 
detected target analyte magnetically labeled
 immobilized magnetic label and passed over 
array specifically patterned complementary noncomplementary probe molecules which are immobilized
over chip magnetic field sensors The sensors detect the
presence the magnetic labels via change sensor
resistance fixed sense current The unbound target
biomolecules are then washed away and residual sensor
signals are obtained sensor sites where complementary
magnetically labeled target and surface bound probe
molecules have successfully interacted An
alternative method based secondary detection step 
performed after the interrogation the probe array with
the target molecules In this method the target molecules
are labeled with small biochemical label such biotin 
Biotinylated target molecules bound complementary
surface bound probe molecules are then detected

Magnetic labels
Magnetic labels carriers also referred microspheres microbeads and nanoparticles have found
wide ranging scientific and clinical application biotechnological and biomedical research most notably 
the areas bioseparations molecular biology and drug
delivery The most important characteristics 
magnetic labels that are used biosensor biochip
devices are size and shape chemical and magnetic composition surface properties stability and ease chemical
functionalisation for the immobilisation biomolecules 
The biochemical functionalisation the magnetic label
used depends the intended application the device the
size and magnetisation the label depends the size and
sensitivity the sensors incorporated and the necessity
 prevent the blockage fouling the microfluidic
components the device during analysis The size the
label used can vary from few microns diameter few
nanometers size will used here simple means
 classification 
Magnetic microspheres
The larger labels diameter have been the most
widely studied preliminary detection experiments using
different types MR sensor They are easily observed and 
hence enumerable using non specialized light microscopy
techniques They may also manufactured uniform
size and shape using preparative methodologies such 
cone filling Micromerw M Micromod http www 
micromod core shell techniques Dynabeadsw
 Dynal http www dynal Furthermore despite
the fact they have lower percentage magnetic composition comparison magnetic nanoparticles 
their increased volume results higher magnetic
moment per label applied magnetic field allowing
distinct detection signals the single label level 
Their uniform size and shape also allows for
quantitative signal data with linearity between the signal
and the number labels detected for defined sensing
area The disadvantages micron sized labels are the
high mass the label relation the biomolecules
tethering the label the sensor surface and the large
diameter the label hindering high density label binding
across the sensor surface 
Magnetic nanoparticles
Smaller nanometer sized labels with high magnetic
 iron oxide content offer solution these
problems the smaller size allows for increased density 
label binding across the sensor surface Unfortunately 
present most commercially available magnetic nanoparticle product samples contain particles with heterogeneous
size for example and shape non spherical 
thus hindering quantification In addition their high
resultant magnetisation and anisotropy for their volume
 applied magnetic field may lead rapid clustering
 single particles aggregating form groups Permanent
clustering labels which cannot remedied using 
discriminatory magnetic force applied the chip 
 chip washing cycles can lead exaggerated positive
signals because non biologically bound labels may remain

attached biologically bound labels Finally despite their
higher magnetic percentage composition magnetic nanoparticles detectable labels acquire smaller magnetic
moment than magnetic microsphere equivalent
applied field and emu respectively 
 Oe Consequently smaller labels require
progressively more sensitive sensors and measurement
systems The majority labels that have been used date
have been iron oxide magnetite maghemite based 
although transition metal containing nanoparticles for
example NiFe CoFe offering higher magnetisation are
now being studied 
Progress magnetoresistive biosensing
Magnetoresistive based devices such large
GMR sensors and spin valves have been used 
detect variety commercially available magnetic
microbeads and magnetic nanoparticles basis for biochip development 
The detection molecular recognition the interaction
 complementary affinity linked biomolecules has
been shown using two types streptavidin functionalised magnetic labels micrometer and nanometer
sized and sensor bound biotin and the biotin 
streptavidin binding couple has been used means
 detect hybridised DNA chip 
Recent developments include going improvements 
device design and demonstrations the reliability these
techniques real world biological applications The types
 MR sensors that are presently under investigation
include large GMR sensors and spin valves 
anisotropic magnetoresistive ring AMR sensors and
Hall crosses Promising candidates for future work
include planar Hall effect sensors and magnetic
tunnel junctions Other magnetic field sensors used
 biodiagnostic devices include inductive coils 
and SQUIDS 
Magnetoresistive detection signals
The MR sensors that are used detect magnetic labels
differ size geometry structure and functionality 
resulting different levels sensitivity dynamic range
and signal noise ratios for the detection magnetic label
 the same size and magnetisation An initial attempt 
compare and contrast the different types sensor used
has been performed although this has been hampered
 the different developmental measurement systems
employed under different experimental conditions The
sensor signal obtained change voltage depends the
inherent magnetic sensitivity the sensor used and
certain physical parameters such the label sensor size
ratio the magnetic moment the label the distance
between the label and the sensing layer the sense current 
and whether not signal amplification techniques are
used The moment the label which depends the
magnetic composition and content related the applied
magnetic field The moment increases with increase
 applied field with linear response until the field
becomes saturating and the moment longer increases
 Consequently reported sensor signals for single
micron sized magnetic labels vary from nV mV
