Abstract
Objective To acquire understanding the societal costs dementia and how they affect families health and social care services and governments improve the lives people with dementia
and their caregivers 
Methods The basic design this study was societal prevalence based gross cost illness
study which costs were aggregated World Health Organization regions and World Bank income
groupings 
Results The total estimated worldwide costs dementia were US billion About 
 the costs occurred western Europe and North America In such high income regions costs 
informal care and the direct costs social care contribute similar proportions total costs whereas
the direct medical costs were much lower In low and middle income countries informal care
accounts for the majority total costs direct social care costs are negligible 
Conclusions Worldwide costs dementia are enormous and distributed inequitably There considerable potential for cost increases coming years the diagnosis and treatment gap reduced 
There also likely trend low and middle income countries for social care costs shift
from the informal the formal sector with important implications for future aggregated costs and
the financing long term care Only investing now research and the development costeffective approaches early diagnosis and care can future societal costs anticipated and managed

Among older people dementia the leading chronic
disease contributor disability and need for care 
Dementia thus affecting every health system the world
significantly and large amounts resources and money
are spent caring for people with dementia A proper
understanding the societal costs dementia and how
they affect families health and social care services and
governments fundamental raising awareness achieving
proper prioritization and focusing efforts improve the
lives people with dementia and their caregivers The aim
 this article summarizing the findings the World
Alzheimer Report and parts the World Health Organization WHO dementia report highlight the economic impact dementia worldwide that governments
and health and social care systems are better prepared for

A Wimo Alzheimers Dementia 
Cost illness CoI studies for dementia have already
been carried out for some regions and countries mainly
from high income HIC parts the worldfor example 
the whole Europe the United Kingdom Sweden
 Australia the United States and Canada 
The consensus that dementia already imposing huge societal economic burdens both through direct medical and
social care and indirect unpaid caregiving families
and friends costs Evidence just beginning emerge
 the extent the economic burden middle income
countries 
CoI studies are descriptive They can used quantify
the total societal economic burden health condition and
can highlight the relative impact different health and social care sectors The distribution costs among different
countries and regions can also estimated and compared 
CoI studies can also used describe with less certainty predict the extent changes distribution 
costs over time Although CoI studies conducted different
health conditions can used compare burden some caution needed using these estimates set priorities The
methods used particularly the types costs included excluded and the data used estimate them may not 
strictly comparable across different health conditions 
Also has been argued that prioritization for investment
 health care should determined the relative incremental cost effectiveness available interventions rather
than the burden the disease Transparency crucial
with regard the assumptions underlying any cost calculations and comparisons 
Previously three articles that highlight the global economic burden have been published These reports
were the time their publication based the best
available data for the prevalence dementia and care
inputs The most recent these updated previous
estimates global costs from US billion 
US billion increase fixed
prices just years This update was based the same
database and the increase mainly result increase
 numbers people affected dementia from 
million million US billion per year 
the worldwide total contributed countries designated
 the United Nations more developed regions and
US billion the total less developed regions 
One major limitation these reports that they contained
very few data health and social care from LMIC and eastern Europe Therefore the cost models relied largely extrapolation economic conditions from higher lower
income countries adjusted for gross domestic product
 GDP per person Also was not possible distinguish between direct medical costs within the health care sector and
direct social care costs within the community and care home
sector Because more articles are now published that least
overcome the limitations mentioned earlier part are
now merging the best available data regarding the worldwide
cost Alzheimers disease and other dementias 
Methods
The estimated numbers people affected dementia
worldwide and different regions worldwide are based 
the World Alzheimer Report the WHO dementia
report and the joint article this issue Alzheimers

with dementia

disease Alzheimer disease combined with cost and 
economic and informal care Two recent systematic reviews
 and secondary articles from reference lists were also
considered for inclusion 
 Key design issues
An ideal worldwide CoI study has societal viewpoint that includes comprehensive accounting informal
care and direct medical and social care costs Precise
data the prevalence dementia and resource use
should derived from representative population based
studies These data and the unit costs applied the resources used should refer the same index year The
same methods should used collect these data across
all countries 
The reality different 
 Estimates the size the older population are variable quality 
 Data dementia prevalence are not available for all
countries 
 Most studies care arrangements informal care and
resource use for people with dementia use convenience
rather than representative population based samples 
People identified through convenience sampling tend
 have more advanced and severe dementia their caregivers typically report higher levels strain and the
families are likely have accessed and have used
more health and community support services Many
 the estimates come from small studies and hence 
may imprecise Many studies are not recent and
care arrangements and patterns health care use
may change over time For many countries there are
few studies available
 Most the source articles have bottom design 
This means that CoI data from local studies are extrapolated greater population country 
A Wimo Alzheimers Dementia 
The costs well the prevalence dementia reflect estimates for Cost estimates based previous years are inflated using relevant country specific data from the
International Monetary Fund World Economic Outlook
 lacking from those sources from the World Bank
 World Fact Book Data per capita GDP were
obtained similar way To permit aggregation across countries and comparisons among countries and regions costs are
expressed U S dollars converted from local currencies
based current exchange rates An approach based purchasing power parity PPP was used the sensitivity analysis 
With these limitations and assumptions mind our base
case approach societal prevalence based gross CoI
study which country specific annual per capita costs direct medical and social care costs and informal care have
been applied estimated numbers people with dementia
 each country derived from the World Alzheimer Report
 and aggregated the level WHO Global
Burden Disease GBD regions and World Bank country
income level groupings the income groups per annum
are low income less lower middle income 
 upper middle income and
HIC more The assumptions for all the cost 
illness estimates are summarized Table 
 Imputation approaches
Our general aim was generate evidence based estimates resource use for each country For all the reasons
presented earlier was necessary rely some degree
 imputation When estimate was available for given
country selected the one that regarded the most
appropriate study terms representativeness and sample
size When estimate was available first used estimates
from other similar countries within the same region failing that adjacent regions 
 Where people with dementia live?
To estimate costs accurately and apportion costs appropriately within sectors crucial estimate the relative proportions people with dementia living home 
 long term care home In HIC people with dementia
residing care homes contribute substantially greater
amount the total cost illness than LMIC where anecdotal information suggests that few such facilities exist 
The large majority people with dementia are cared for 
informally the community Thus Alzheimer Disease International ADI commissioned worldwide questionnaire survey key informants clinicians social
workers Alzheimer associations representatives policymakers who estimated what proportion people with dementia resided care homes separately for urban and
rural areas From United Nations database gathered
information the ruralurban population distributions
 that when combined with the results from the ADI
questionnaire gave single weighted proportion people
with dementia living the community and hence likely 
 receipt informal care 
 Informal care
The care input family members friends and others has
 important influence the societal costs dementia since
 producer extensive amount unpaid informal care
 However translating this contribution into costs
 not straightforward First quantifying caregiver time 
problematic The inputs most commonly assessed are 
assistance with basic activities daily living ADL such
 eating dressing bathing toileting grooming and getting
aroundsometimes referred personal care 
assistance with instrumental activities daily living
 IADL such shopping preparing food using transport 
and managing personal finances supervision manage
behavioral symptoms prevent dangerous events 
Personal care relatively easy assess and interpret
across countries and cultures but the nature and relative importance IADLs are likely much more culture specific Furthermore the person with dementia and the
caregiver may each contribute these activitiesfor example shopping referred joint production 
Second costing informal care also complicated and
controversial Two methods are frequently used 
the opportunity cost approach and the replacement cost
approach To calculate the opportunity cost first
necessary identify the possible alternative use the
caregivers time For caregivers who give cut back
 work provide care the cost for informal care should
 valued according the production loss resulting from
absence from work More challenging the costing 
caregiver time for retired people There obvious
answer how this should calculated because there are
 obvious market prices The replacement cost approach assumes that the informal caregivers inputs should
 calculated according the cost replacing their care input with those professional caregiver 
Based our review the international literature 
identified
 appropriate studies which time spent assisting
with basic ADLs was quantified covering countries
 and representing the worldwide
dementia population The average caregiver input
was hours day range hours day WHO

Regional imputation was carried out for the remaining
countries according the procedures described previously 
However for all African regions the absence any regional data worldwide average figures were used Although
the degree imputation required was quite substantial particularly LMIC this still represents considerable advance the evidence base available for previous reports
because large extent were able use regionspecific figures The detailed estimates from six Latin American countries India and China from the Dementia
Research Group provided important data from LMIC 
We used the combined ADL figures combining basic
ADL and IADL care inputs the base option Table 
We then conducted sensitivity analyses using only basic
ADLs personal care and all categories informal care 
Our justifications were that support for IADLs important part the caregivers life with person with dementia 
and that there are many more articles describing combined
ADLs than those covering only basic ADL care input 
The base option for costing informal care uses the opportunity cost approach valuing informal care the average
wage for each country Average wage figures were available for countries covering people with dementia
worldwide A woman was identified the main informal
caregiver for people with dementia studies
representing countries with the global dementia population and the wage
figures were adjusted according gender differences
 average wage From the caregiver literature 
spouses are the main caregivers for people with
dementia but with regional differences Different hoc
costing approaches the spouse input and 
average wage were tested the sensitivity analysis 
 Direct costs
Data direct costs were available from countries 
representing the worldwide dementia population 
For each country sought estimate both total direct
costs and the distribution between direct medical and social
care costs Direct medical costs refer the medical care system such costs hospital care medication and visits 
clinics Direct social care costs are for formal services provided outside the medical care system including community services such home care food supply and transport 
and residential nursing home care 
Regional imputation from local similar countries was
possible for additional countries representing 
 the worldwide dementia population mainly Europe
but also Latin America For the remaining the dementia population countries mainly Africa and Asia
 mainly LMIC data were available even from neighboring countries From macroeconomic research known
that there strong correlation country level between
per capita expenditure health care and per capita GDP 
Similarly single linear regression model indicated strong
relationship between the costs per person with dementia and
year and the GDP per person and year derived from articles 
 for each increase US annual percapita GDP the annual cost per person with dementia increased US P confidence
interval CI This approach was used estimate the total direct costs for the countries with 
data However regression did not work well for the estimation the distribution between direct medical and social
care costs because the lack data and the percentage
distribution observed one country China was used 
specify the likely distribution China represents large proportion the worldwide dementia population and even
more that from LMIC From Chinese studies there
were also data for which was possible split direct costs
into medical and social care costs Thus was regarded 
justified use China the key country for these estimates 
 Representativeness
Of the studies that were used for estimating the costs 
informal care regard studies having populationbased designs including control subjects people without dementia For direct costs the corresponding figures were 
 studies Thus there still risk that costs may overestimated because part the results are based nonpopulationbased studies studies without control subjects 
 Sensitivity analysis
Because CoI studies depend set sources and assumptions there are always uncertainties cost estimates 
To consider the impact the uncertain background factors
mentioned earlier have conducted comprehensive set
 one way sensitivity analyses which use different
source data varied assumptions However another component the sensitivity analysis highlight the fact
that there are different views what should included 
 CoI estimatefor example regarding exchange rates 
PPPs informal care quantification and costing 
An alternative the regional imputation method for
missing data informal care regress average wage
 GDP per person This regression model showed that
 change GDP per person US will change
the average hourly wage US CI 
 P 
Because substantial proportion caregivers are
spouses and most but not all could assumed beyond
the usual working age recalculated informal care and
total costs value the care inputs spouse caregivers 
 and the average wage and applied this reduced
wage the estimated proportion caregivers each
country that were spouses 
A Wimo Alzheimers Dementia 
Thus the sensitivity analysis compared the
types informal care that should included cost
estimations the hourly costs attached informal
caregiver inputs regression the relative cost inputs
from different types caregiver replacement cost approach instead opportunity cost and the use PPPs
instead current exchange rates 
Results
 Results base option
For the ADI worldwide questionnaire survey had
data from respondents countries eight outliers
were excluded because great discrepancy other responders from the same country Two trends were obvious first the mean proportion people with dementia
residing home from the survey was higher LMIC
 CI than HIC CI 
 When the proportions for each country were applied
 individual countries and aggregated estimated
 CI living home LMIC and

Second the proportion people with dementia that live
 home was higher rural than urban areas

The per capita costs dementia varied considerably 
World Bank income classification from US countries with low incomes US LMIC US

with high incomes Table When multiplied the estimated numbers people with dementia this generated aggregated costs US billion countries with low
incomes US billion LMIC US billion 
upper middle income countries and US billion

care and the direct costs social care generally contribute similar proportions total costs whereas
the proportionate contribution direct medical costs
 are much lower Table However low income
and LMIC direct social care costs are small and informal
care costs predominate Thus although the total cost per person with dementia times higher HIC than lowincome countries the direct costs social care are 
times higher Table 
 Sensitivity analyses
If only basic ADLs are used for the costs informal care
instead combined ADLs basic ADLs and IADLs the total costs are lower whereas they are higher combined ADLs and supervision are included Compared with
US billion the base case these sensitivity analyses
provide lower bound estimate US billion only basic ADLs and upper bound estimate US billion

and IADLs and supervision 
If the regression model applied for missing data informal care the results are similar the base option The use

With the replacement costs approach based the average wage social care professional from the Laborsta database health and social work the total costs were

If PPPs are used for the estimates instead exchange

PPP these proportions are and respectively 
 Comparison with previous worldwide cost estimates
 dementia
In the worldwide costs dementia were estimated
 US billion and were later updated US 
billion for The basic assumptions these articles
were different from those this article First only basic
ADL assistance rather than combined basic ADL and
IADL assistance were included for estimating the costs informal care and PPPs instead exchange rates were used
for the currency transformations The number basic
ADL hours per day was also somewhat lower and was assumed uniform across the world the and
 estimates hours day However the sensitivity
analyses for these earlier estimates options similar those
applied this article were included making direct comparisons possible When doing clear that the costs per
person with dementia are rather similar particularly for
the combined ADLs Table

 US billion 
The scale these costs understandable when one
considers that according our estimates the World
Alzheimer Report million people worldwide
 around the worlds total population live with
dementia A high proportion people with dementia
need some care ranging from support with IADLs such
 cooking shopping full personal care and roundthe clock supervision In some HIC between one third
and one half all people with dementia live resourceand cost intensive residential nursing home care facilities 
There clear imbalance the global distribution occurrence dementia and costs Although the majority 
people with dementia live countries with low middle incomes the much higher per capita costs dementia that
prevail countries with high incomes mean that 
global societal costs are currently incurred those regions 
This disparity arises part because the imbalance 
costs between sectors In low income and LMIC the formal
social care sector accounting for the direct costs care 
the community paid social care professionals and 
care homes practically nonexistent Therefore responsibility falls largely unpaid informal caregivers In these regions informal care costs predominate accounting for
around two thirds all costs compared with around 
 HIC whereas HIC the direct costs social care account for nearly half all costs compared with only one
 lower income countries Because average wages
 used estimate informal care costs are much lower 
LMIC this has important impact comparative total
costs 
 Methodological issues
The accuracy any estimate the worldwide costs 
dementia depends the quality the data used estimate This article based better underlying sources
than previous worldwide estimates but there are nevertheless significant limitations Because the uncertainties consequently use the concept cost
estimates rather than cost calculations Our global CoI estimates rely studies dementia prevalence and
dementia related resource use that are unequally distributed worldwide with data lacking from many countries 
Even with the recent large increase population surveys
conducted LMIC there particular lack relevant
studies from Africa the Middle East and from eastern
Europe Data resource use are also more extensive
than previously available particularly with respect informal care provision LMIC The Dementia Research Group studies Latin America India and China
 add significantly the preexisting database 
which was heavily skewed European and North
American studies The results from the ADI worldwide
survey key informants regarding placement 
residential care also great advance from previous
studies It should noted that the majority resource
use studies have been carried out convenience
samples those who have accessed services rather
than representative population based studies and hence
are skewed toward those greater need for care which
may result overestimate costs particularly 
HIC The LMIC estimates informal care were based
largely the population based studies Latin
America India and China where most study sites
between and those with dementia were rated
 needing care whereas most HIC estimates are derived from convenience samples 
The most significant limitation the estimation direct costs both medical and social care In this study these

 Costs inflated using average world inflation figures 
figures are based part imputation from nearby countries but for many others were estimated with regression
model based mainly HIC data These figures must interpreted with caution The use exchange rates provide
 standard metric for comparing costs across countries may
have underestimated costs lower incomes relative HIC 
When the PPP approach was used instead costs are
incurred HIC instead the base case 
 instead middle income countries and instead low income countries The sensitivity analysis also reflects the fact that there are different opinions 
what should included the cost estimates particularly
regarding informal care and how these should cost 
The use average wage for the costing informal care
may arguably overestimate costs arising from the contributions those who would not normally form part the labor
forcefor example retired spouses There may also 
impact caregiving the health the informal caregivers
 that subsequently may result increase their use
and costs health services However because the lack 
data was not possible include such costs the cost
model 
 Future trends
It very difficult make projections future costs 
However assume that all potential background factors remain unchanged and factor only the increases the number people with dementia forecast 
then worldwide societal costs will have increased
 The reality more complicated Future costs
could influenced macroeconomic factors for example the pace economic development and dementiaspecific factors including changes the incidence and
prevalence dementia patterns help seeking and
trends toward earlier diagnosis the availability 
health and social care services changes care systems
and care conditions and the availability new and
more effective treatments 
There are very few estimates the extent the treatment
gap for dementia LMIC but likely much greater
than better resourced settings However the cost 
drugs tend quite similar worldwide was recently reported for acetylcholinesterase inhibitors for Alzheimers disease and hence relatively unaffordable LMIC Now
the patents are going out but for the moment difficult
 estimate what the effects might 
The current inequitable distribution dementia costs
among world regions will also have implications for future
trends These will inevitably tend toward more rapidly increasing per capita and population costs LMIC such
 way that the global distribution costs will come resemble that morbidity Cost increases LMIC countries are likely driven several underlying
factors Despite the probability that economic development
will change health care use general there are some factors that are more less related future cost estimates 
dementia and similar conditions which informal care 
 significant component First increases numbers 
people with dementia will occur much more rapidly 
LMIC because the more rapid demographic aging 
those regions Thus the World Alzheimer Report
 forecast increase numbers Europe during the years from increase North America compared with 
growth east Asia south Asia 
 parts Latin America and North Africa
and the Middle East Second with economic development 
average wages will increase particularly rapidly LMIC 
Third costs can seen proxy for available resources obvious that resources for dementia care particularly formal medical and social care are unequally
distributed worldwide With increased awareness will
come increased demand for such care Residential care
and community social care systems are well developed
 many HIC but are scarce LMIC where there still
 strong reliance traditional informal family care arrangements However seems likely that the need for
community and residential care will grow LMIC and
with the direct costs In many developing countries traditional family and kinship structures are under threat
from the demographic social and economic changes
A Wimo Alzheimers Dementia 
that accompany economic development and globalization
 The education women and their increasing participation the workforce generally seen positive human
development indicators tend reduce their availability
for caregiving and their willingness take this additional role Populations are also increasingly mobile education cheap travel and flexible labor markets induce
children migrate cities and abroad seek work 
Last declining fertility the last stage the demographic transition leaves increasing numbers older people lacking family support 
 Comparisons with costs other chronic conditions
It difficult compare our estimates the global
societal costs for dementia with those other conditions
because few such estimates exist and there are problems
with comparability the way that societal costs were
computed In some countries attempts have been made
 study this issue using data that are more comparable 
In the United Kingdom recent report commissioned
 the Alzheimers Research Trust Dementia focused the economic burden dementia and other
chronic diseases and sought compare like for like disease costs with national expenditure research 
The reports authors estimated the annual societal cost
 dementia billion billion for cancer billion for heart disease and billion for stroke The societal costs dementia almost matched those cancer 
heart disease and stroke combined The annual percapita costs were estimated for dementia 
 for cancer for stroke and for heart
disease However investment research did not match
the relative burden these different chronic diseases 
For every million care costs arising from the disease was spent cancer research 
 heart disease research and dementia research In article from Sweden the costs dementia were compared with other estimates for chronic
disorders The annual costs dementia billion Swedish Kronor SEK was higher than for depression 
billion SEK stroke billion SEK alcohol abuse
 billion SEK and osteoporosis billion
SEK but the distribution between the diseases and the
types costs differ Although for example the direct
costs social care constituted the greatest cost component dementia indirect costs terms production
losses dominated for depression 
 Conclusion
The worldwide costs dementia are enormous and inequitably distributed Expenditures medical care for dementia are also lower than they should all world
regions As shown the World Alzheimer report 
 there are strong arguments favor early diagnosis
and interventions even there are several methodological
obstacles overcome Evidence based interventions including caregiver support and training and respite care
should being provided routinely but are not even 
HIC Integrated multitargeted interventions including
both nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatment
approaches are rare Prevention strategies based the potential link between cardiovascular risk factors and dementia
 including
Alzheimers
disease 
found
epidemiological studies need tested controlled
studies There urgent need develop cost effective
packages medical and social care that meet the needs
 people with dementia and their caregivers across the
course the illness and evidence based prevention strategies Only investing now research and costeffective approaches early diagnosis and care can future
societal costs anticipated and managed Underdiagnosis 
misdiagnosis and undertreatment not cost effective 
Governments and health and social care systems need 
 prepared adequately for the future and must seek
ways now improve the lives people with dementia
and their caregivers
