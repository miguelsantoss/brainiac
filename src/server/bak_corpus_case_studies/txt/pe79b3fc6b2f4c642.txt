the risk future conversion Alzheimers disease AD older patients with mild cognitive impairment MCI 
Background Patients who develop AD pass through transitional state which can characterized MCI In some
patients however MCI more benign condition which may not progress AD may slowly Patients Eighty
consecutive patients who met criteria for the diagnosis MCI were recruited from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimers Disease
Center Alzheimers Disease Patient Registry Methods At entry into the study each patient received MRI examination
 the head from which the volumes both hippocampi were measured Patients were followed longitudinally with
approximately annual clinical cognitive assessments The primary endpoint was the crossover individual MCI patients
 the clinical diagnosis AD during longitudinal clinical follow Results During the period longitudinal observation which averaged months the MCI patients became demented Hippocampal atrophy baseline was
associated with crossover from MCI AD relative risk RR When hippocampal volume was entered into
bivariate models using age postmenopausal estrogen replacement standard neuropsychological tests apolipoprotein E
 APOE genotype history ischemic heart disease and hypertensionthe RRs were not substantially different from that
found univariately and the associations between hippocampal volume and crossover remained significant Conclusion In
older patients with MCI hippocampal atrophy determined premorbid MRI based volume measurements predictive 
subsequent conversion AD 
NEUROLOGY 
For patients who develop AD the transition from 
normal cognitive state clinically recognizable AD
occurs gradually over years It presumed that the
pathologic substrate the cognitive decline that
characterizes AD follows similar slowly progressive
course with gradual accumulation degenerative
pathology AD ongoing for years perhaps even decades before manifestation unequivocal clinical
symptoms Memory impairment usually the initial
manifestation dementia AD That the transition
from normal cognition AD gradual however 
presents clinicians with common and difficult diagnostic problem Does evidence mild memory impairment older individual represent the
earliest manifestation AD more benign forgetfulness that may not progress dementia? Clinical
criteria for the classification patients with mild
cognitive impairment MCI have been established 
The rate which MCI patients convert AD 
substantially greater than that the general older
population and MCI patients are the subject 
several more recent treatment trials 
Structural and functional imaging findings are diagnostic markers AD Most imaging studies how 
ever have been cross sectional nature and have
been designed demonstrate differences between
older controls and patients who were already demented Prior studies addressing prediction future
dementia have been done with relatively few patients with familial AD with the oldest old 
using subjective image assessment We addressed
this issue conducting imaging studies and then
longitudinally following individuals who were 
increased risk AD because the diagnosis MCI 
The imaging measurement evaluated was MRI based
volume measurements the hippocampi We chose
this measurement because medial temporal lobe limbic structures particularly the hippocampus play 
central role memory function and are the site 
the earliest neurofibrillary pathology 
memory impairment the hallmark early 
and MRI detects subtle medial temporal lobe damage AD In this study tested the hypothesis that premorbid MRI based hippocampal volume
measurements patients with MCI were related 
the risk subsequent conversion AD We also
determined whether the predictive power hippocampal volume measurements was independent

for participation the studies which were approved 
the Mayo Institutional Review Board Study participants
were assigned diagnostic group categories during ADC

Ascertainment endpoint The primary endpoint 
dependent variable this study was the crossover individual MCI patients the AD category during longitudinal follow Patients were enrolled throughout the study
period All study patients underwent clinical neuropsychological reevaluations approximately month intervals 
Twenty six patients had single serial follow assessment had two follow assessments and had three
 more follow assessments MCI patients who remained unchanged cognitively were characterized NEUROLOGY April 
ble and the mean follow time for these patients was
 months Patients who became demented all 
whom received the diagnosis probable AD that time 
were designated crossover patients the mean follow 
time from enrollment crossover for these patients was
 months The diagnosis dementia was made
according DSM III R criteria The diagnosis probable AD was made according NINCDS ADRDA criteria 
An MRI examination the brain was performed within
 months the initial clinical assessment all patients 
These MRI studies were used the diagnostic process
only exclude treatable causes cognitive impairment 
The hippocampal volume data were unknown the consensus committee throughout the study 
MRI methods All imaging studies were conducted 
 T Signa General Electric Medical Systems Milwaukee WI using standardized imaging protocol Measurements intracranial volume were derived from 
 weighted sagittal sequence with contiguous
sections Volume measurements the hippocampi were
derived from weighted three dimensional D volumetric spoiled gradient recalled echo sequence with 
contiguous partitions slice thickness 
 field view views and flip angle 
All image processing steps every patient were performed the same research associate who was blinded 
all clinical information age sex clinical course insure
that the volumetric data were unbiased Validation studies
have shown the intra rater test retest coefficient variation hippocampal volumetric measurements 
with this method The D image data set each patient
was realigned into orientation perpendicular the
principal axis the left hippocampal formation The imaging data were then interpolated plane the equivalent
 matrix and magnified The voxel size 
the fully processed image data was The borders the hippocampi were manually traced the work
station screen for each image slice sequentially from posterior anterior Typically imaging slices were
measured for each hippocampus In plane hippocampal anatomic boundaries were defined include the 
sectors the hippocampus proper the dentate gyrus and
the subiculum figure The posterior boundary the
hippocampus was determined the oblique coronal ana 
tomic section which the crura the fornices were defined full profile 
Intracranial volume was determined tracing the
margin the inner table the skull contiguous images
from the sagittal sequence 
Apolipoprotein E genotyping DNA was extracted from
peripheral leukocytes and amplified PCR PCR products were digested with HhaI and the fragments were
separated electrophoresis polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel The gel was then treated with ethidium
bromide for minutes and DNA fragments were viewed
 ultraviolet illumination 
Assessment clinical variables The presence absence hypertension and ischemic cardiac disease was
assessed review medical records Patients were recorded being positive for hypertension hypertension 
its treatment was identified any point time the
medical record Patients were considered have ischemic
heart disease any the following were identified angina
pectorus myocardial infarction coronary bypass surgery 
 coronary angioplasty The time menopause and the
presence absence estrogen replacement therapy were
also extracted from the medical records 
Statistical methods The hippocampal volume measurements each patient were normalized for interpatient
variation head size dividing hippocampal volume 
the total intracranial volume that particular patient We
previously determined age and sex specific normal percentiles for normalized hippocampal volume group 
cognitively normal older controls using the MRI volumetric
method described Age and sex specific normal percentiles for each the MCI patients were determined
using this normal value database Each percentile was
then converted W score The W score the value from
 standard normal distribution corresponding the observed percentile For example for standard normal distribution the and percentiles are given 
 and respectively Thus patient with 
hippocampal volume adjusted for age and sex the fifth
percentile the normal value database would receive W
score Similarly patient the percentile
would receive W score When this method assigning W scores applied the normal older control patient
database the resulting W scores precisely follow standard normal distribution W scores other study populations including our MCI cohort can then compared
directly this standard distribution providing framework for comparing hippocampal volume measurements
among individual patients appropriately corrected for age 
sex and head size

Although direct comparison the W scores patients who did and those who did not crossover seems
natural the length follow varied among patients 
Direct comparisons between patients who crossed over versus those who did not were therefore analytically inappropriate To accommodate variable follow periods 
life table methods were used evaluate patient characteristics relating crossover rather than discriminate function analyses logistic regression Each predictor variable
was evaluated univariately Because sample size limitations extensive multivariate modeling was not feasible 
The possibility confounding between hippocampal W
score and other variables was assessed fitting bivariate
models evaluating hippocampal W score with each the
other predictor variables individually APOE status estrogen replacement hypertension and ischemic heart disease
were entered dichotomous variables all analyses All
tests were two sided Estimates relative risk RR were
obtained using usual semiparametric Cox regression testing methods A nonparametric version Cox regression
testing was used for hypothesis testing for quantitative
variables For these same reasons confidence intervals are
not reported for estimates risk 
Tests hypotheses for quantitative risk factors using
Cox regression testing are sensitive departures from
normality this case more accurate probability statements are obtained using logit rank tests Because some
 the data were skewed with the degree skew varying
among successive risk sets the logit rank test was used
both univariately and bivariately hypothesis testing 
The logit rank tests were implemented computationally 
treating the logit rank scores for each the quantitative
variables each risk set time dependent covariates

Kaplan Meier survival curves showing the probability
 crossover for patients stratified hippocampal W
scores into three groups W W W 
were used for display purposes only illustrate the association between hippocampal volume and crossover AD 
The W score W was selected priori This natural
cut point indicating values patients that are equal 
greater than the mean value among controls The cutoff

these associations were significant 
Separate bivariate analyses were performed with hippocampal volume together with each the other predictor

 Hippocampal W score and crossover KaplanMeier curves patients whose hippocampal W score 
baseline was W and

value expected for age and sex matched controls Thirteen

between and Patients the three W score groups
were similar most demographic clinical and cognitive
testing variables see table During the period observation the MCI patients converted AD Of the
 MCI patients with hippocampal W scores baseline converted AD with W scores between 
and crossed over and with W scores 
crossed over see figure 
Only hippocampal volume DRS FCSRT free recall and
age were statistically significant predictor variables univariate analyses the risk crossover see table The
interpretation hippocampal W score result that for
each one unit increase the hippocampal W score 
less atrophy the RR for crossover declined The
risk crossover declined with advancing decade age 
Carriers the APOE allele were more likely 
cross over than noncarriers Patients with better scores 
the cognitive tests were less likely cross over The one
exception was that the COWAT with RR and 
nonsignificant value The association between estrogen
replacement and crossover was not significant 
Patients with history hypertension were more likely 
cross over than those without and patients with history
 cardiac ischemic disease were less likely cross over
Discussion Based life table analysis estimate that MCI patients with hippocampal W
scores baseline will convert AD within 
years compared with those with hippocampal
W scores between and and those with
W scores There considerable controversy
whether all MCI patients will eventually progress 
AD whether MCI represents relatively stable
condition some Our results indicate only that the
rate conversion greater MCI patients with
smaller hippocampi and not address the lifetime
risk conversion 
Old age established risk factor for AD and 
 cross sectional prevalence study older age would
 expected associated with greater prevalence AD This not the case study such 
ours because the rate which individuals with MCI
progress AD does not necessarily accelerate with
age The MCI patients this cohort shared 
similar cognitive and demographic profile study
entry see table It possible that because AD 
clinically heterogeneous disorder patients with incipient AD who were younger may have had more
rapidly progressing form than those who were
older 
This work focused the prediction crossover
using hippocampal volume measurements The intent was not conduct exhaustive assessment 
possible neuropsychological testing instruments 
predictors crossover but test the hypothesis that
the predictive power imaging studies independent other potential predictor variables such 
standardized neuropsychological tests The MMSE
and DRS are measures general cognitive function

Unlike genetic markers which are present 
birth imaging studies can only identify progression
 the disease itself This true for both structural
imaging measures and functional measures such 
PET because imaging studies become abnormal only
when the disease process itself has produced deviation from normal cerebral function anatomy 
Ideally the imaging findings should represent markers incipient disease Our data suggest that MRIbased volume measurements the hippocampi
fulfill this criteria

The unique aspect our study was the combined use
 all the following features rigorous quantitative MRI based measurement fairly large longitudinal cohort MCI patients who are 
risk for typical sporadic AD and patients whose
age was fairly typical for onset AD rather than 
the extremes the age spectrum 
There are several limitations this study that
cannot fully addressed this time The criterion
used determine the endpoint was the clinical diagnosis AD At our center the clinical diagnosis 
probable AD accurate compared with the
pathologic diagnosis definite AD Thus absolute
determination the endpoint this study can only
 ascertained the future autopsy Despite the
small sample size significant relation between
premorbid hippocampal volume and crossover AD
was demonstrated which illustrates both the
strength the association and the clinical potential
 the technique Moreover this association was not
altered when evaluated the context series 
bivariate analyses which included many known risk
factors for AD Additional studies with larger sample
sizes are needed however more accurately delineate the rate which risk crossover increases
with increasing hippocampal atrophy and the possibility that the relation may nonlinear and the role
 interactions with other predictor variables

Article abstractObjective To investigate the association between apathy and depression and specific cognitive deficits
 AD Background Apathy and depression are frequent behavioral disorders patients with AD However the neuropsychological correlates these disorders have rarely been examined Methods A comprehensive neuropsychological and
psychiatric evaluation was carried out patients with AD with apathy and depression patients with AD with
apathy only patients with AD with depression only and patients with AD with neither apathy nor depression
 control group Results Patients with apathy had significantly lower scores tests verbal memory naming set
shifting and verbal fluency compared with patients without apathy The association depression and apathy produced
significantly more severe deficits compared with apathy only test abstract thinking Finally depression the
absence apathy was not associated with more severe cognitive impairments compared with the AD control group Conclusions Apathy but not depression associated with significantly more severe frontal lobe related cognitive deficits AD 
NEUROLOGY 
Apathy and depression are among the most prevalent behavioral disorders patients with AD In 
recent study that included consecutive patients
with AD found that had clinically significant apathy Our study also demonstrated several
significant correlates apathy AD such more
severe impairments activities daily living more
severe extrapyramidal signs and significantly
higher frequency both major depression and dysthymia compared with nonapathetic patients with
AD Although also demonstrated significant association between apathy and memory deficits the
study was limited because included only small
sample patients with AD with apathy only 
Thus for the current study examined separate consecutive series patients with probable
AD who were assessed with comprehensive neuropsychological battery that included tests verbal
and visual memory abstract reasoning auditory
attention set shifting verbal fluency visuospatial
reasoning verbal comprehension naming construc 
tional praxis and manual dexterity To examine the
influence apathy and depression cognitive functions our study had design and included
patients with AD with depression but apathy 
apathy but depression both apathy and depression and neither apathy nor depression 
Patients and methods Patients A consecutive series
 patients who attended the dementia clinic our
institute complaining memory problems were screened
for participation the study After neurologic and neuropsychological evaluation patients met the State California AD Diagnostic and Treatment Centers criteria for
vascular dementia and additional people had normal
assessment Both groups were excluded from further evaluations Thus the final sample our study included 
patients who met National Institute Neurological and
Communicative Disorders and StrokeAlzheimers Disease
and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable
AD and patients with memory deficits the neuropsychological evaluation but deficits other cognitive
domains this group had Clinical Dementia Rating CDR

Results Demographic and psychiatric findings Our
sample was divided into groups with apathy depression
based the following diagnostic scheme patients meeting
the DSM IV criteria either major depression dysthymia were included the depressed group whereas patients scoring more than SD the mean apathy scale
score for age comparable normal control group cutoff
score points reported previous 
were considered apathetic Four groups were thus construed apathy without depression apathy only group 
 depression without apathy depression only
group with dysthymia and with major depression both depression and apathy with
dysthymia and with major depression and neither
apathy nor depression control group No significant between group differences were found for age sex 
years education MMSE scores and scores agitation
and delusions table 
Neuropsychological findings A multivariate analysis
 covariance for the neuropsychological variables showed
 significant overall effect Wilks lambda 
 On individual comparisons patients with apathy
only had significantly lower scores than patients without
apathy with without depression the following tests 
Buschke Total Recall F apathy
only versus depression only apathy only versus
control group and the Boston Naming Test
 F apathy only versus depression
only apathy only versus control group 
and significantly lower scores than patients with depression only the Buschke Delayed Recall F 
 Patients with apathy with without depression had significantly lower scores than patients without
apathy with without depression the Wisconsin Card
Sorting Test F and verbal fluency
 F and significantly lower scores
than the control group the Purdue Pegboard Test
 F Finally patients with apathy
and depression had significantly lower scores than the
other three groups the Ravens Progressive Matrices
 F No significant differences 
any neuropsychological test were found between patients
with depression only and the control group table 
Discussion This study examined neuropsychological correlates apathy AD and there were several important findings First patients with AD with
apathy had significantly lower scores tests verbal memory naming set shifting and verbal fluency
than patients with AD without apathy Second the
copresentation both depression and apathy did not
result cognitive deficits greater than those for apathy alone except test abstract thinking 
where patients with both apathy and depression had
significantly lower scores than patients with apathy
only Finally depression the absence apathy
was not associated with more severe cognitive impairments when depressed patients with AD are
compared with patients with AD with neither apathy
nor depression 
Before offering further commentary several limitations our study should pointed out First 
did not divide our sample depressed patients with
AD into those with major and dysthymic depression 
and whether specific type depression was associated with more severe cognitive impairments could

not examined However recent study 
could not find significant differences cognitive
function between patients with AD with major depression dysthymia depression Second our
study included patients with questionable dementia
 patients with memory deficits cognitive testing who did not meet the full criteria for probable
AD and whether all these patients will eventually
meet the full criteria for AD unknown However 
several studies demonstrated that most patients
with questionable dementia progress the phase
 overt dementia Moreover our study the proportion patients with questionable dementia was
similar all four groups and the inclusion patients with mild cognitive impairments may have
protected from lack significant between group differences due floor effect Another limitation 
that not have neuropathologic confirmation 
our clinical diagnoses Thus whether our patients
with apathy had dementia with Lewy bodies which
was found significantly associated with more
severe frontal dysfunction than classic AD cannot
 ruled out Finally measured the severity 
depression with the HAM D which may potentially
include apathy related items However mean
HAM D scores for AD apathy only and AD control
groups were similar suggesting that HAM D scores
were not influenced the severity apathy 
In study that examined the neuropsychological
correlates apathy patients with PD found
that apathy with without depression was associated with significantly more severe deficits tasks

current findings patients with both apathy and depression did not show more severe cognitive deficits
than patients with apathy only We suggested that
apathy PD may akin the concept bradyphrenia which was defined slowing
 cognitive processing associated with impairment
 concentration In preliminary study the cognitive correlates apathy smaller sample patients with AD apathy was significantly associated
with more severe memory deficits The current
study assessed larger sample patients with AD 
and not only replicated the association between apathy and memory deficits but showed that patients
with AD with apathy with without depression 
also had significantly more severe deficits tasks 
naming verbal fluency and set shifting thus demonstrating profile cognitive deficits similar 
those found previously patients with PD with
apathy However apathy AD may also correlate
with overall cognitive disability and future studies
should examine the specificity the current findings 
Verbal fluency set shifting and abstract thinking
have all been considered cognitive abilities related 
frontal lobe functioning Apathy has been attributed disruption corticosubcortical circuits involving the basal ganglia and the frontal lobes 
 suggested that lesions the dorsolateral frontal cortex anterior cingulate globus pallidus may produce both apathy and deficits 
frontal loberelated tasks such verbal fluency
and set shifting Several recent findings validate this
hypothesis first demonstrated that patients with
stroke with apathetic behavior had significantly
higher frequency lesions involving the globus pallidus compared with patients with stroke without
apathy Second both AD and PD apathy was
significantly associated with relatively more severe
deficits frontal loberelated tasks Third 
found that apathy AD was significantly associated
with more severe extrapyramidal signs compared
with patients with AD without apathy which further
suggests disruption basal ganglia structures 
patients with AD with apathy
