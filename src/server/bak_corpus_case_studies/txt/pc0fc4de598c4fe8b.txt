A spin valve sensor biochip was used detect cystic fibrosis related DNA targets for the purpose developing affordable diagnostic chip The strategy used was based the field focusing magnetically labeled target DNA sensor sites using U shaped
current lines U shaped spin valve sensors fabricated within the line structures detected real time the hybridization DNA targets
 complementary DNA probes previously immobilized onto the chip surface Hybridization occurred relatively short times 
min comparison with conventional hybridization approaches Statistical data detection signals for single probe and
multiprobe experiments was obtained showing significant difference between complementary binding signals and noncomplementary
and background ones

I INTRODUCTION
T
HE use magnetoresistive sensors for biological applications has been generating ever increasing interest from
laboratories and companies the last few years 
The main interest far has been the detection DNA hybridization using magnetoresistive biochips and this has been
accomplished using two detection approaches In the first
one designated post hybridization detection biotin labeled
DNA targets are incubated with DNA probe functionalized
chip surface for hybridization occur At later stage streptavidin functionalized magnetic labels are incubated with the
chip binding the hybridized targets Hybridization detection
 achieved through the sensing the stray fields created 
the labels using the magnetoresistive sensors The hybridization
process usually takes from targets need diffuse
passively solution find their complementary DNA probe 
the surface This approach has been used the Naval Research
Laboratory INESCMN and the University Bielefeld
 but unsuitable for applications where fast response
 required desired such biological warfare agent identification microbial pathogen detection clinical diagnostics
during medical doctors appointment 
Recently INESC MN has followed second approach designated magnetic field assisted hybridization and detection 
In this case magnetically labeled DNA targets are transported
and concentrated DNA probe functionalized sensing regions
 use specially designed current lines The proximity 
target and probe increases the rate which hybridization occurs Previously tapered current lines were fabricated and

used focus labels small spin valve sensors and
hybridization times less than min were observed and detected These sensors can only detect small numbers 
 magnetic particles bound the surface In order 
achieve higher sensing dynamic range and higher biological
sensitivity new magnetic focusing system was developed such
that labels were focused larger sensing areas This system 
based the use combination and magnetic fields
created external electromagnet and chip U shaped
current lines An oscillating magnetic field gradient created 
focusing labels inside the U shaped line structures and enabling
magnetic field assisted hybridization 
This paper reports the detection cystic fibrosis related
DNA targets using the field focusing method and integrated
U shaped spin valve sensors Statistical data from array 
sensors was obtained with the purpose showing the applicability the magnetoresistive biochip platform for fast genetic
disease diagnostics

DNA probe functionalization Individual chips containing 
array sensors and associated U shaped lines were diced and
wire bonded pin chip carriers 
Single stranded mer DNA probes and targets were synthesized MWG Biotech with end modifications thiol for the
probes and biotin for the targets They were designed correspond genes that have been found either 
down regulated asah cystic fibrosis related cell lines versus
healthy cell lines preliminary microarray analysis gene expression 
Probes were immobilized over the chip surface using 
protocol described Targets were magnetically labeled

described Final target concentrations solution were
smaller than fmol 
During experimentation array sensors was monitored real time applying mA sense current sequentially

multiplexing was achieved with CMOS analog multiplexer

 Oe rms frequency Hz was applied together with
 plane Oe bias field the spin valve sensing direction Fig Sensor output was measured Hz with conms frequency bandwidth

Magnetic field assisted experiments using the field
focusing method proceeded follows small volumes
 the solutions magnetically labeled DNA targets
were added the chip field focusing was applied for 
 min particles were left completely settle down over
the sensor for min saturation the chip was washed
with mM phosphate buffer pH remove unbound
labels wash and the chip was washed again with more
stringent buffer mM phosphate buffer containing
 mM NaCl remove weakly nonspecifically bound
labels wash 
III RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
Table I shows statistical results obtained for field focusing
magnetic field assisted hybridization experiments min 
focusing mA rms min settle time where the chip was
functionalized with single probe and interrogated with
either complementary noncomplementary asah 
magnetically labeled targets six sensors were monitored 
In Table I saturation signals correspond particle detection
signals when large number particles settled over the
sensor step the experimental protocol It observed
that saturation signals are comparable the two experiments
and that deviation signals less than Binding detection
signals signals after washing the other hand are significant
different higher the case the complementary target
than the noncomplementary case indicating that hybridization occurred the first case but was negligible the latter 
After the second more stringent wash the complementary
binding signal smaller which consistent with the removal
 weakly nonspecifically bound targets Notice that hybridization signals can vary among the different sensors 
A number cumulative issues are thought responsible
for the deviation nonuniform probe immobilization nonuniform hybridization efficiency nanoparticle size variation and
clustering nonuniform magnetically labeled target solution

lines and sensor resistance and sensitivity variation

In this experiment also observed that saturation signals
are similar among different sensors Complementary binding
signals are now higher than noncomplementary 
background signals which are comparable and indicate that
the system has good biological specificity Furthermore higher
