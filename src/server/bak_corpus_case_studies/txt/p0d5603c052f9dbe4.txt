Introduction
Diagnosing prostate disease complex task and typically requires
 combination clinical biochemical and imaging biomarkers 
Specically the diagnosis prostate cancer PCa based clinical
symptoms digital rectal examination prostate specic antigen PSA 
levels transrectal ultrasonography TRUS and tissue sample biopsy
guided TRUS from which histopathological tissues are graded using
the Gleason Score GS Despite advances these techniques the accuracy the tests remains limited missing some PCa cases 
Multi parametric magnetic resonance imaging MP MRI can aid 
the detection and characterization PCa combining anatomical 
functional and molecular imaging providing improved support for
decision making regarding clinical treatment This MP MRI approach includes the use diusion weighted imaging DWI for
studying the prostate DWI provides qualitative and quantitative microstructural information non invasive manner making use 
water diusion probe prostatic tissue DWI measures the motion
 water molecules within tissues which inuenced the presence
 intra and extracellular compartments well intravascular spaces 
The apparent diusion coecient ADC measure water mobility
and can estimated from the signal intensity SI decay between two
 more images exhibiting dierent levels diusion contrast quantied the value Previous studies reported reduced ADC values 
PCa compared benign and healthy tissue In order for ADC
quantication become more widespread the clinic essential 
standardize prostate DWI protocols Several parameters inuence both
the acquisition time and the measured ADC values impacting the accuracy the technique these include the repetition time TR the echo
time TE and the number and the choice values

To minimize scanning time while maintaining the best possible
diagnostic performance the determination optimal pair values desirable Choosing the maximum and minimum values for
adequate ADC estimation thus becomes critical Recent recommendations state that the minimum value should range between and
 reduce the impact micro perfusion capillaries 
the ADC estimate while the maximum value should chosen within
the interval However has been acknowledged
that visual evaluation DWI acquired with values higher than
 can advantageous due improved lesion conspicuity
 Several studies have already explored pairs values with
maximum values beyond this limit for ADC quantication
 However there still consensus regarding the optimal value pair T A study Wang T compared
diagnostic performance for dierent maximum values but selected 
xed minimum value which not agreement with
current guidelines 
At T Peng compared seven value pairs ranging from
 obtaining ADC cut 
with the highest sensitivity and specicity for the bvalue pair However since the signal noise ratio
 SNR the images dependent the eld strength the role 
higher values for ADC quantication needs reevaluated T 
The purpose this study was therefore evaluate the optimal pair
 values for ADC estimation T resulting the best performance for dierentiating healthy tissue from PCa 
 Data analysis
Prostate images were evaluated radiologist with years 
experience who localized and described the lesions combining information from morphologic and dynamic images 
Taking into account the clinical imaging report two radiology researchers with training DWI both with over years experience 
localized the lesions the DW images and images were
evaluated avoid areas post biopsy hemorrhage and ADC maps
were generated rule out shine through eects The slice that
better depicted the lesion corresponding its highest dimension was
chosen accounting for the prostate sector identied the prostatectomy TRUS biopsy report 
Regions interest ROI were drawn around the lesion encompassing the hyperintense region and copied the
other diusion images Regarding healthy glandular tissue ROI were
drawn images with xed size the peripheral
zone PZ and the central gland CG and copied the DW images 
These images were then visualized ensure that the ROI fell
within the intended anatomical structure and did not exhibit hyperintense signal Furthermore avoid MRI occult lesions the histology reports were taken into account when delineating
the ROI Mean signal intensities SI for each DW image were recorded
for both regions healthy tissue and lesions 
ADC maps were generated for each value combination using the
software Osirix Dicom Viewer version with the equation

The choice values included the DWI sequence central
research issue since impacts the estimated ADC values 
Prostate studies focusing specically investigating the best value
pair for ADC quantication T are still scarce Previous studies reported mean ADC values ranging from
 PCa and for
normal tissue In our study globally mean ADC values for
PCa ranged from and between and
 for normal tissue Compared the previously
mentioned studies our mean ADC ranges were similar for both PCa and
normal tissue although the observed ranges were slightly wider for
both tissue types Dierent factors could explain the dierence the
mean ADC ranges between studies namely variations the physiological characteristics the studied tissue types and localization the
lesions PCa GS classication dierences DWI protocols including
the choice values and the methodology used image analysis 
Our results demonstrate that PCa and normal tissue ADC values vary
substantially with value combinations agreement with other studies Previous ADC quantication studies used maximum values from
 combined with reporting ADC PCa
between and and 
 healthy tissue In our study for similar combinations maximum values between and combined
with the range ADC values for PCa was equivalent
 However for both areas normal
glandular tissue PZ and CG the range and mean ADC values were
lower than those previously reported 
For maximum values between and combined
with previous studies reported ADC values ranging from
 for PCa and for
healthy tissue Comparable ADC ranges were found our
study for similar value combinations 
Other research groups used minimum values higher than 
 and maximum values within reporting PCa
and normal tissue ADC ranging and
 respectively When testing similar value
combinations our results were similar for PCa ranging
 However healthy tissue lower maximum ADC value was obtained 
Overall our results conrm that the estimated ADC inuenced 
the used values Using minimum value higher than leads
 lower ADC values This was expected since including 
increases the contribution micro perfusion eects This eect causes

the value pair and for the value pair 
 AUC sensitivity and specicity were and 
respectively In their study AUC comparison also showed dierences between the best value combinations Comparing our results theirs for similar value pair higher AUC
 was obtained In addition our study higher AUC 
 sensitivity and specicity 
were achieved when the value pair was used for ADC
estimation The dierences found between studies could due 
higher SNR available T and the use channel phasedarray coil According Shah the endorectal coils normally used
 T can achieve the same clinical accuracy pelvic phase array
coil T although ADC values can dier Nevertheless pelvic
phase array coils are greatly advantageous regarding patient comfort 
Also the ROI delineation methodology likely inuence ADC
estimates Some authors use images for lesion demarcation others
the DW images with higher values 
Our methodology for ROI demarcation was dierent from that used 
Peng they used images and copied the ROI the DW
images whereas drew the ROI and propagated
them the other DW images Since included only the most restricted lesion area likely represent the most malignant part the
tumor this likely explain the lower ADC values obtained However other factors could have contributed the ADC dierences found
between studies namely variations glandular and stromal structure 
dierences DWI protocols and patient population 
In our study the prostate anatomy was divided into PZ and CG The
term CG used the literature represent the aggregation the
transitional zone and the central zone Since prostate MRI the separation between these zones dicult the term CG can adopted 
avoid erroneous identication lesion localization 
Our study has some limitations Firstly lesion ROI may not have
accurately reected histological tumor outline Also have consider that mean ADC values PCa may have been overestimated Some
patients underwent MRI after TRUS biopsy which could have altered
the ADC values due the presence residual hemorrhagic components Although did not control the time between biopsy and MRI 
during image analysis were alert avoid areas hemorrhage 
 and images Kim reported that the inuence blood
 ADC measurements could ignored We used the mono 
substantial signal attenuation low values which explain higher ADC
values when including very low values Maximum values also
inuence the ADC estimates previous studies also showed that increasing the maximum value leads lower ADC values At
higher values the signal loss due micro perfusion eects completed and only diusion eects remain returning lower ADC values 
Moreover high values normal prostate tissue signal suppressed 
increasing lesion conspicuity the most malignant part the tumor 
representing the region highest restriction highlighted and lower
ADC values are measured Higher values are nevertheless associated
with decreased SNR which could lead underestimated ADC values
and lower diagnostic performances Despite this loss SNR our
study the value pair with highest diagnostic performance was 
 even though there were signicant dierences when
comparing the AUC between the best value pairs The combined
use T equipment and channel receiver coil increase the
achievable SNR This type coil not often available the clinical
setting where channel coils are more frequently used
 SNR also inuenced the used TE and
guidelines recommend TE lower than used our study
 TE 
Another important issue under investigation the number bvalues used for ADC quantication Multiple values can used 
perform ADC measurements impacting its accuracy and precision
 Using higher number values increases the condence
associated the estimated ADC compared when only two values
are used Nevertheless the larger the number values included 
DWI sequence the longer its acquisition time In our study chose 
evaluate only value pairs identify the smallest set values that
would enable accurate ADC quantication within the shortest possible
acquisition time for wider applicability the clinical practice 
The diagnostic performance prostate DWI relies the established ADC cut Our results were consistent with previous studies
 showing ADC values lower malignant lesions than normal
tissue and AUC ranging from for all value pairs 
The value pair showed the highest AUC 
for ADC cut sensitivity specicity and
accuracy were and respectively Mean ADC values were global PZ 
 CG for normal tissue and global 
 PZ and CG for PCa

exponential model since widely implemented but several papers
highlight the importance employing exponential kurtosis other
more complex models for studying PCa Furthermore our
sample was small especially the number included malignant CG
lesions making the ADC values potentially less representative Furthermore had exclude patients from the study since lesions were detected the MP MRI analysis However well known
that MP MRI does not have negative predictive value especially lesions classied with GS and smaller than 
In any case only those patients were diagnosed with PCa within
 months scanning The relatively large slice thickness could
have limited detectability partial volume eects could also potentially
explain why only one lesion was detected per patient while PCa typically multifocal 
To our knowledge this the rst paper that performed ADC analysis
 PCa T using large combination value pairs with bvalues higher than and several minimum values
higher than 
Conclusion 
Although several value pairs presented statistically comparable
AUC the value combination with highest AUC was 
 with sensitivity specicity and accuracy and
 respectively Future prostate cancer studies should validate this
combination investigating ADC correlation with the GS
