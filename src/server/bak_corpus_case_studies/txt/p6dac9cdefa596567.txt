Article abstracWe evaluated new magnetic resonance MR basedtechnique for performing volumetric measurements temporal lobe structures The technique was designed assist making the clinical diagnosis dementia 
the Alzheimer type DAT We chose specific anatomic regions interest because their known involvement memory function and the neuropathology DAT and used regression model assess the effects age the volumes
 the anterior temporal lobe ATL and the hippocampal formation HF These measurements were normalized 
total intracranial volume TIV The volumetric measurements both the normalized ATL and HF were significantly
smaller DAT patients N than controls N but the HF volumes provided much better separation between the two groups Eighty five percent the DAT patients fell below the range the HF TIV measurement for the control subjects This separation held over the entire age range studied Normalized volumes both
the HF and ATL decreased with age significantly for both the DAT patients and the controls These results support the
contention that MR based HF volumetric measurements are accurate differentiating DAT patients from cognitively
normal elderly individuals This technique may useful adjunct making the clinical diagnosis DAT 
NEUROLOGY 
While the accuracy making the clinical diagnosis
 dementia the Alzheimer type DAT reasonably high difficulties remain differentiating early DAT from the cognitive changes

Criteria for the clinical
diagnosis dementia have been proposed

Association NINCDWADRDA task force however the absence biologic marker the definitive diagnosis can made only with biopsy 
autopsy The clinical diagnosis most difficult

We are proposing the use recently developed
magnetic resonance MR imaging technique for

Methods Patients This study included patients with
probable DAT and healthy cognitively normal individuals similar age Most the DAT patients and all
 from Mayo Clinic
Alzheimers Disease Patient Registry Additional DAT
patients were recruited from the referral practice 
neurologist R C P and these patients received essentially the same evaluation patients drawn from the
Alzheimers Disease Patient Registry 
Patients and controls were recruited into the Mayo
Clinic Alzheimers Disease Patient Registry from individu coming Division Community I 
Medicine Mayo Clinic for their annual general
medical examinations As part the Alzheimers Disease
Patient Registry all patients and controls received medical neurologic performed 
internist and neurologist respectively A complete history was taken from the patient and another knowledgeable source Laboratory studies were performed including complete blood count chemistry profile RPR thyroid function studies folic acid chest ray and 
ECG All patients and controls underwent neuropsychological tests including the Wechsler Adult Intelligence
Scale Revised Wechsler Memory Scale 
Wechsler Memory Scale Revised Rey Auditory
Verbal Learning Test the Short Test Mental Status 
the Hachinski Ischemic Index the Geriatric Depression
Scale and Global Deterioration Scale under 
supervision neuropsychologist All the DAT
patients met the criteria for probable DAT outlined 
the NINCDSIADRDA task force The DAT patients were
 mild disease 
received Global Deterioration Scale 
The control subjects had evaluation identical 
that the probable DAT patients They had cognitive
complaints and were judged cognitively normal and
functioning independently the Alzheimers Disease
Patient Registry Consensus Committee comprised 
internist two neurologists two neuropsychologists and
three nurses involved the evaluation these patients 
One R C P asked the patients for their willingness participate this MR study The risks and benefits participation this project were discussed with
the patients and compensation was provided All 
the control subjects had Global Deterioration Scale rating which was normal None the patients controls were judged depressed and all had Hachinski
Ischemic scores less than four None the patients 
controls had clinical evidence for strokes nor did they
have any cortical infarctions T weighted MR

sagittal images were obtained with the following parameters sections field view FOV

 the left H F was located from the sagittal images and
 oblique coronal 
acquired perpendicular this plane with the following
parameters FOV phase encoding
steps slice thickness interleaved with interslice gap The following three features which are necessary for accurate volumetric measurements were incorporated into the design this pulse sequence the
sequence was tailored perpendicular the long
axis the H F each individual was T weighted 
thereby providing high brain CSF and gray white matter
contrast and individual image slices were thin and
contiguous which minimized partial volume averaging 
thereby enhancing accuracy volume measurements Both temporal lobe structures ATL and HF were
measured from this oblique coronal pulse sequence 
All subjects also underwent axial double spin echo
sequence This sequence was used exclude subjects
with possible cortical infarctions but was not used for
volumetry 
Image processing volume measurements The volume
measurement technique has been described greater
detail elsewhere Briefly image processing was done
with ANALYZE software Biodynamics Research Unit 
Mayo Foundation Rochester MN running indep S workstation T 
employs semiautomated technique that combines tracing and thresholding High contrast region interest
boundaries which were formed brain CSF interface 
were defined gray scale threshold which was set
halfway between background and brain intensity Region
 interest boundaries which were not defined high
gray scale contrast were manually traced with mousedriven cursor Gray scale values pixels external the
outline were set zero Once the boundary the region
 interest had been defined serial planimetric sections its volume voxels was determined automatically
 counting the number pixels within the threshold

The slope the regression lines not different
between patients and controls for the ATL TIV but

The HF TIV decreases more rapidly with age for
DAT patients than controls and this study separation controls from patients was more complete older subjects 
Discussion The data from this study demonstrate
that this MR technique may useful distinguishing patients with probable DAT from agematched controls Volumetric measurement the
HF separated the patients with DAT from the normal controls reasonably well Only three the
patients overlapped and consequently this measurement technique more promising than other

quantitative imaging techniques previously available 
While the volumetric measurements the
ATL also separate the two groups significant
fashion there sufficient overlap between the two
groups make less useful 
Consequently recommend the use the HF
measure assist the diagnosis DAT 
We also found increasing volume loss with age 
controls for both normalized temporal lobe regions

tation studies The slopes the normalized volumes when regressed age did not differ between
the DAT patients and the controls for the normalized ATL measure but did differ significantly for
the normalized HF measure The significance 
this finding uncertain this time and will
acquire additional data for further amplification 
A question can raised concerning the validity
 using the clinical diagnosis DAT the criterion against which assess the volumetric measures Since inception Mayo Clinic
Alzheimers Disease Patient Registry autopsies
have been obtained patients and controls All
 the cases with the diagnosis probable DAT
have been correctly classified thus far when the
clinical and neuropathologic diagnoses have been
compared Therefore appears that while the
clinical diagnosis DAT not the ideal gold standard there least good agreement with the
ultimate neuropathologic diagnosis obtained 
autopsy the registry from which subjects for this
study were drawn 
For nearly two decades investigators using CT
have attempted quantify hemispheric cerebral
atrophy order differentiate patients with DAT
from cognitively normal elderly 
Semiautomated CT based measurement techniques
suffer from several inherent technical limitations
when compared with MR CT based techniques
have been hampered lack specificity separating individual patients with DAT from normal
elderly persons and this the primary reason

 CT based quantitation atrophy has not
gained widespread clinical It
 plausible that the most significant limitation previous semiautomated CT based attempts quantify
global cerebral atrophy DAT was that the areas
 the brain that are most severely involved the
temporal lobe particularly H F were not

recent nonvolumetric CT

While this manuscript was preparation 
paper was published Kesslak the same
topic Kesslak use MR based volumetric
technique that seems similar the one have
previously published although some technical
details were not fully described They measured

patients with probable DAT N and elderly
controls N In earlier study Seab 
used MR based single slice planimetric measurements the HF separate DAT patients N 
from elderly controls N In both these studies the probable DAT and control groups were
completely separated quantitative measures 
 overlap was found Conversely our study
with larger sample size roughly three times larger than that Kesslak DAT patients were
incompletely separated from controls the basis
 HF volume measurements We feel that while
hippocampal volumetry useful will not provide
 absolute diagnostic standard when applied
prospectively the population risk for DAT 
In summary our technique MR based HF volumetric measurements shows promise providing
useful diagnostic information 
patients with probable DAT from normal elderly
subjects This technique may prove clinically useful adjunctive test elderly patients suspected having DAT This can considered costeffective approach because patients evaluated for
dementia must undergo cross sectional imaging
study exclude other treatable causes dementia Simple visual inspection the MR images for
atrophy may not adequate because the model
 described incorporates adjustment for both
age and total intracranial volume Ultimately 
will important expand this database develop age specific sensitivity and specificity figures In
addition the technique will applied patients
with early memory deficits the absence more
generalized cognitive decline determine this
technique will able predict which patients will
ultimately develop dementia
