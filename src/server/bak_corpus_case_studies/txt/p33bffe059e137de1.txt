Abstract In group older adults with very mild dementia 
 aimed characterize the nature and magnitude cognitive decline measured the Cogstate Brief Battery 
relation A levels and hippocampal volume Participants
were characterized according their status the Clinical
Dementia Rating CDR scale A total individuals
who were CDR and had low cerebral A levels A 
individuals who were A and CDR and individuals
who were A and CDR were included this study 
Participants completed the CogState brief battery baseline 
and and month follow Linear mixed
model analyses indicated that relative the A CDR 
group the A CDR group showed increased rates 
memory decline and hippocampal volume loss However 
compared the A CDR group the A CDR group
showed changes cognitive function hippocampal volume over months The results this study confirm that 
individuals with very mild dementia who also have biomarker
confirmation A changes cognitive function manifest

which proposes that AD begins with A accumulation which
leads the expression and aggregation tau both which
then combine cause synaptic and neuronal loss Hardy and
Selkoe Masters and Selkoe The progressive loss

cognitive deterioration reduced functional activities daily

Older adults for whom they their caregivers report 
noticeable decline cognitive abilities are now investigated
for early dementia If reported difficulties are corroborated 
objective evidence cognitive impairment performance
between and standard deviations below the mean 
appropriate control group formal cognitive assessment 
well there being medical situational information account for this impairment individuals can considered 
 the early stages dementia Morris Petersen
 This early stage dementia classified clinically 
 the Clinical Dementia Rating CDR scale and has been
termed Bvery mild dementia Morris Bmild
cognitive impairment MCI Petersen It has been estimated that individuals with CDR score have approximately risk progressing CDR mild dementia 
over years Morris and this risk increased 
approximately individuals who also have high A
 A Rowe Recent consensus criteria that integrate risk from biomarkers and the amyloid cascade hypothesis
stipulate that individuals with CDR score and who are
also A can considered being the prodromal stage 
AD Albert Such criteria also raises the hypothesis
that the pathological processes underlying cognitive impairment individuals who have CDR score but who have
low levels cerebral A A may reflect neurodegenerative
 psychiatric processes other than AD Albert 
Dubois and Albert However the nature and magnitude
 cognitive decline associated with known biomarkers AD
 cerebral A and hippocampal volume individuals with
 CDR score remain poorly defined In previous study
 MCI observed that A was associated with moderate
decline memory but much greater loss 
hippocampal volume over years Lim 
 However given the short follow interval possible that these relative estimates are unreliable and warrant
replication over longer periods assessment 
The aim this study was follow prospectively changes
 cognition and hippocampal volume over months A
and A adults with CDR score The first hypothesis
was that baseline compared CDR A older adults and
CDR A older adults CDR A older adults would
show large impairments memory and working memory and
that this would accompanied smaller hippocampal volumes The second hypothesis was that compared CDR 
A older adults CDR A older adults would show
faster decline memory and working memory over
 months and that this would also accompanied increased loss hippocampal volume The third hypothesis
was that any cognitive decline observed CDR A
older adults would less than that observed CDR

Methods
Participants
Participants were recruited from among individuals enrolled 
the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle AIBL 
Flagship Study Ageing The process recruitment and classification the AIBL cohort has been described detail previously Ellis Rowe Briefly individuals
who volunteered were excluded from the AIBL study they
had any the following schizophrenia depression Geriatric
Depression Score GDS greater Parkinsons disease 
cancer other than basal cell skin carcinoma within the last
 years symptomatic stroke uncontrolled diabetes current
regular alcohol use exceeding two standard drinks per day for
women four per day for men 
All participants enrolled AIBL underwent thorough
medical and neuropsychological evaluation each assessment and this information was used classify the clinical
disease stage The neuropsychological test battery used 
measure cognition the AIBL study has been described 
detail previously Ellis A clinical review panel
chaired DA reviewed all available medical psychiatric and
neuropsychological information confirm the cognitive
health individuals enrolled the CN group In this clinical
review panel participants cognitive and functional status was
rated using the CDR scale For this study individuals classified CDR were considered have very mild dementia MCI while those with CDR were classified 
cognitively normal CN Morris The CDR rating 
participants was made without reference A imaging and
magnetic resonance imaging MRI data The study was approved and complied with the regulations the institutional research and ethics committees Austin Health St 
Vincents Health Hollywood Private Hospital and Edith
Cowan University Ellis All participants provided
written informed consent prior participating the study 
Measures
Amyloid Imaging
A imaging with positron emission tomography PET was
conducted using either C Pittsburgh Compound B PiB 
F florbetapir F flutemetamol PET methodology has
J Mol Neurosci 
been described detail previously Clark Rowe
 Vandenberghe A min acquisition
was started min after injection PiB and min acquisitions were performed min after injection florbetapir and
 min after injection flutemetamol Clark Rowe
 Vandenberghe For PiB and
flutemetamol PET standardized uptake value SUV data were
summed and normalized the cerebellar cortex SUV resulting
 region cerebellar ratio termed SUV ratio SUVr For
florbetapir SUVr was generated using the whole cerebellum 
the reference region In accord with previous studies SUVr was
classified dichotomously either low high For PiB and
flutemetamol SUVr threshold was used For
florbetapir SUVr threshold was employed 
Hippocampal volume HV was normalized for head size using
total intracranial volume sum grey matter white matter and
cerebral spinal fluid volumes Dore 
Cognitive Assessments
All participants were assessed with standard clinical rating
scales and comprehensive neuropsychological battery from
the AIBL study All these measures have been described 
detail elsewhere and were administered according standard
protocols trained research assistants Ellis Lim
 In addition the tests used inform the rating
 the CDR premorbid intelligence was estimated using the
Wechsler Test Adult Reading WTAR and levels depressive and anxiety symptoms were assessed using the
Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale HADS Cognition
was measured using the Cogstate brief battery CBB Lim
 This has been described detail previously but
briefly This battery consists four computerized tests the
Detection DET task simple reaction time test shown 
measure psychomotor function the Identification IDN task
 choice reaction time test shown measure visual attention the One Card Learning OCL task continuous visual
recognition learning task that assesses visual learning within 
pattern separation model and the One Back OBK task 
task working memory and attention Lim 
From these four tests two composite scores were computed 
The Attention Psychomotor Function composite was computed standardizing the speed performance the Detection

Data Analysis
To characterize the nature and magnitude cognitive impairment the CDR groups series analyses covariance
 ANCOVA were used compare the cognitive composite
scores and HV between the A CDR A CDR and
A CDR groups baseline In these analyses the cognitive composite score HV was entered the dependent
variable and age premorbid intelligence and GDS scores were
added covariates 
To characterize the nature magnitude change cognition over time series linear mixed effects models
 LMM using unstructured covariance matrix and maximum likelihood estimation were conducted examine the
relation between group A CDR A CDR A
CDR and time baseline and month
assessments each cognitive composite score and HV For
each LMM the cognitive composite score HV was treated
 the dependent variable Group time and the interaction
between group and time were also specified fixed factors 
and participant was specified random factor Age 
premorbid intelligence and depressive symptoms the first
assessment were specified covariates Group mean slopes
were computed for each cognitive composite score reflect
estimates the rate cognitive change over time and estimates slope the A CDR and A CDR groups
were compared that the A CDR group Differences
 slopes were expressed using Cohens

CDR A
The first hypothesis that baseline compared CDR A
older adults and CDR A older adults CDR A
older adults would show large impairment learning and
working memory and that this would accompanied 
smaller hippocampal volume was supported Older adults
who had met criteria for very mild dementia MCI based
 their AIBL assessment showed impairment learning and
working memory magnitude that was convention large
 which accompanied smaller hippocampal volume large magnitude Fig In contrast this same
group showed only subtle impairment attention
and psychomotor function Interestingly the pattern impairment older adults who had CDR score but who
were A was qualitatively opposite this with moderate
and statistically significant impairment attention and psychomotor function and only small and non significant impairment learning and working memory Fig This difference persisted despite this group meeting the AIBL consensus clinical criteria for MCI based medical and neuropsychological workup Ellis Similarly differences
 hippocampal volume were observed between CDR 
Aolder adults and CDR A older adults Fig 
Thus baseline the A CDR group showed the cognitive profile characteristic early AD with impairments 
memory and lower HV In contrast the A CDR group
showed qualitatively different cognitive profile and evidence hippocampal volume loss when compared the
CDR A group Fig 
The second hypothesis that compared CDR A older
adults CDR A older adults would show increased cognitive decline learning and working memory over
 months and that this would also accompanied increased loss HV support In the A CDR group 
performance measures learning and working memory
deteriorated substantially across the years however the
A CDR group there was deterioration memory
function all Fig The difference the rate which
learning and working memory performance over time worsened the A CDR group compared the A CDR 
group was convention moderate Further this
decline learning and working memory was accompanied 
 substantial loss HV over the same time Fig 
Hippocampal volume the A CDR group continued
 deteriorate over the months while individuals the
A CDR group showed very subtle and non significant
loss HVover the same period The magnitude the difference between these two groups the rate which HV deteriorated over time was very large In contrast the
decline observed learning and working memory and 
hippocampal volume decline was observed for the measure psychomotor function and attention the A CDR

The third hypothesis that any cognitive decline observed 
CDR A older adults would less than that observed 
CDR A older adults was supported Although the CDR
 A group showed impairment attention and psychomotor function their baseline assessment this group showed
 further decline these functions over the subsequent
 months Fig Similarly there was decline learning and working memory over the same period Fig 
Instead there was some indication that over months the

Finally the A CDR group also showed further reduction HV over time Fig Consequently differences
between the CDR A and CDR A groups the rate
 change cognitive function over months and the rate
 HV loss over the same time were small and not statistically
significant Fig The absence any progressive loss 
cognitive function HV suggests that the cognitive impairment that accorded with the blinded clinical diagnosis MCI

the cognitive deficit the CDR Agroup may reflect 
static injury disruption that has occurred the past 
Alternatively the cognitive impairment observed the CDR
 A group may reflect some neurodegenerative disease
process that much slower than that related A Dubois
and Albert If this the case then likely that
individuals will gradually accumulate A level that would
 considered abnormal PiB PET SUVR and once
that threshold has reached cognitive decline and faster loss 
HV will become evident 
When considered together the results the current study
show that individuals with very mild dementia there 
substantial loss higher cognitive functions such memory
and working memory This loss cognition accompanied
 loss brain volume which the current study was
determined from the hippocampus It important note that
while individuals the current study were classified having very mild dementia their average score the MMSE was
 indicating that despite being symptomatic the severity 
clinical symptoms was very mild Despite this the rate loss
 memory and working memory functions were substantial 
The results presented here are consistent with and extend 
those reported over months Lim suggesting
that even with shorter assessment intervals the estimates 
memory decline and hippocampal volume loss remained reliable When taken together these data also show that very mild
dementia suitable disease stage for interventions designed
 halt slow disease progression prior the development 
dementia Golde The data reflecting the loss 
higher cognitive function and loss HV the CDR A
older adults can considered reflect the nature disease
progression untreated very mild dementia and therefore
could utilized statistical models aimed determining
sample sizes for clinical trials licenced novel drugs for
AD 
When interpreting the results this study there are several
important caveats note First participants enrolled the
AIBL study were not recruited through epidemiological sampling methods and participants with memory complaints were
recruited primarily through memory clinics and referrals from
their primary care physicians As such will important for
the estimates cognitive decline reported here replicated and extended more population based samples such

Second were unable investigate the effect APOE

APOE carriers the CDR A group The
observation that the number APOE carriers was low

 will important for future studies with larger samples 
older adults with MCI very mild dementia determine
whether this exacerbation memory decline A cognitively normal older adults similarly extends individuals who
have evidence some cognitive impairment 
These caveats notwithstanding the results this study 
along with those from previous studies confirm that individuals who have been classified clinically being the very
early stages AD and who have biomarker confirmation 
A changes cognitive function manifest primarily deterioration memory processing Braak and Braak 
Knopman Further the gradual loss hippocampal volume observed this study also consistent with neurobiological studies showing the predilection early AD

 Finally this study provides additional evidence that the
combination AD biomarkers and sensitive cognitive assessments are important the identification individuals the

alter the course cognitive deterioration AD
