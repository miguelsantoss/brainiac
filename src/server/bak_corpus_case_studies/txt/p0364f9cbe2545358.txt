Summary Great emphasis being placed identification neurotransmitter
systems involved the symptomatic manifestations neurological and psychiatric
 In the case Alzheimers disease which now seems one the most
common causes mental deterioration the elderly compelling evidence has been
developed that acetylcholine releasing neurons whose cell bodies lie the basal
forebrain selectively degenerate These cholinergic neurons provide widespread
innervation the cerebral cortex and related structures and appear play 
important role cognitive functions especially memory These advances reflect

neuropathological examination the
brains disclose characteristic abnormalities Fig such neuritic plaques

that the presenile and senile forms AD
may have common basis comes
from genetic studies indicating that the
disease may occur autosomal dominant some families In this article 
these two disorders are considered 
single entity AD 
The cognitive deficits AD have been
attributed abnormalities the cerebral cortex and hippocampal formation

plaques are prominent these brain
regions In fact the density neuritic

autopsy correlates with the severity 
their cognitive defects Since normal
aging associated with reduction 
the number cortical nerve cells 
has been difficult clearly demonstrate
that the loss nerve cells AD more
severe than age matched controls 
However over the past years substantial evidence has accrued indicate
that excessive nerve cell loss does occur

now affirming that the frontal and temporal cortices are most affected 
Cholinergic Neurons and
Alzheimers Disease
In that neurotransmitter specific neuronal systems have been shown have 
role the pathophysiology disorders
like Parkinsons disease and Huntingtons disease investigators have
begun examine the role neurotransmitters the symptoms disorders 
cognition and memory One strategy
used clinical neuropsychopharmacology administer drugs that selectively
alter central neurotransmission and then
determine whether these manipulations
produce symptoms similar those seen
 the disorder 
Drugs that block central acetylcholine
 ACh muscarinic receptors have long
been known disrupt higher cognitive
functions and induce transient amnestic
states When low doses scopolamine centrally active muscarinic receptor blocker were administered 
young adult volunteers the drug caused
selective deficits recent memory but
SCIENCE VOL 
did not impair immediate registration 
long term memory The scopolamine treated young adults exhibited 
profile the Wexler adult inventory
scale WAIS similar that seen 
elderly drug free individuals with significant reduction performance IQ intelligence quotient but not verbal IQ
resulting comparable organicity
index The important role played 
cholinergic neurons memory has been
substantiated the findings that drugs
which potentiate central cholinergic
function enhance recent memory and
reverse the performance deficits induced
 anticholinergics Thus central
cholinergic neurotransmission may play
 role the processing recent memories and abnormalities this system
may underlie some the symptomatic
manifestations AD 
Evidence further implicating the cholinergic system AD derived from
neurochemical studies brain tissue obtained from affected patients Since neurons have highly specialized biochemical
processes for the synthesis storage and
inactivation their neurotransmitter
 Fig these specialized chemical properties can used markers for
quantifying the innervation brain
region transmitter specific neurons
 The most stable and specific neuronal markers are the enzymes responsible
for the synthesis the neurotransmitter 
These enzymes appear restricted 
 most cases the neurons that release
the neurotransmitter their activity remains relatively stable brain for many
hours after death 
In the cerebral cortex and hippocampal formations patients who have died
with AD Ahe activity choline acetyltransferase CAT the enzyme that synthesizes ACh significantly reduced
 percent compared agematched controls that died unrelated
causes Table In contrast 
muscarinic cholinergic receptors which
are concentrated neurons receiving
cholinergic innervation have generally
not been found decreased the
cortex patients with AD 
Although some reductions CAT activity have been observed subcortical
structures such the basal ganglia 
these changes are less severe and more
variable than those occurring the hippocampus and cerebral cortex The activity acetylcholinesterase AChE 
the enzyme that hydrolyses ACh was
considerably redued the cortex and
hippocampal formation patients with
AD Although AChE

which are cholinergic might not appreciated with cell counting techniques

Early studies demonstrated that undercutting the cerebral cortex caused 
marked reduction the activity CAT

This finding was consistent with the conclusion that cortical cholinergic innervation came from neurons located outside

neurons which utilize other neurotransmitters including dopamine and norepinephrine were also observed stain

recently immunocytochemical studies
have been used localize CAT containing neurons innervating the cortex however even this method has yielded conflicting results which may reflect the
exceptional difficulty purifying this

were compared with sections from 
age matched control The patient with
AD had profound and selective loss

the globus pallidus were not affected

Because the familial form AD may
represent separate entity subsequent
quantitative analysis neuronal cell loss

 P No consistent alterations 
cell density were observed adjacent

Thus these pathological findings indicate that the cholinergic deficits the

dying with AD result from degeneration nerve cells the nbM

monkeys Immature plaques were
rich AChE activity but contained little
amyloid Mature plaques showed
marked AChE activity and substantial
amounts amyloid End stage plaques
contained large amounts amyloid but

AChE activity This investigation suggested that AChE rich dystrophic neurites presumably derived from nbM axons were early component the
plaque and that loss these neurites
was associated with the formation 
burned out plaques and reduction 
AChE activity the cortex One
can imagine that this process occurring
repeatedly and affecting many choliner

gic axons would result multiple neuritic plaques and profound reductions 
AChE and CAT activity the cerebral

reductions CAT activity and with the
severity cognitive impairments AD
lends support this hypothesis 
Specificity the Nucleus Basalis
Lesion Alzheimers Disease
The reductions the presynaptic
markers for the cholinergic neurons 
the cerebral cortex and hippocampus 
AD appear specific rather than
reflecting more global change neuronal markers Neurons that use GABA 
their neurotransmitter are thought 
intrinsic the cerebral cortex for
example their cell bodies and axons are
restricted the cerebral cortex The
concentration GABA and the activity
 GAD the enzyme that synthesizes
GABA have not been found consistently reduced the cerebral cortex
and hippocampus AD Similarly cholecystokinin CCK argininevasopressin and vasoactive intestinal
polypeptide VIP neuropeptides that
are localized neuronal cell bodies
within the cortex were not significantly
decreased AD Thus 
markers for several neuronal systems
intrinsic the cerebral cortex exhibit
neither the consistent nor the profound
reductions demonstrated for the cholinergic systems 
However should noted that con 
centrations somatostatin neuropeptide believed localized cortical
bipolar neurons may significantly decreased AD Because the
growing evidence the localization
 neuropeptides neurons that utilize
the amine neurotransmitters 
seemed possible that the reduction 
somatostatin reflected its partial localization the affected cortical cholinergic fibers derived from the nbM However excitotoxin induced lesions the rat
VGP did not decrease somatostatin levels the cortex hippocampal formation whereas excitotoxin lesions the
hippocampus caused profound reduction the somatostatin level without
affecting CAT activity Thus the
reduction somatostatin levels the
cortex and hippocampus AD appears
 reflect alterations another neuronal
system probably intrinsic these regions and distinct from the nbM cholinergic pathways 
Several studies have been performed
 the levels the presynaptic markers
for the noradrenergic neurons the cerebral cortices patients who died 
AD and the results have ranged from
normal values significant decrements
 Degeneration the locus

from AD whereas this noradrenergic

important differences the synaptic orga ization and physiology the two
affected neuronal systems Whereas the
dopatm nergic innervation the striatum
appears highly arborized and overlapping the cholinergic fibers
innervating the cortex exhibit topographic radial distribution 
More importantly the firing rates dopamine neurons are very low and show
 correlation with specific aspects 
movement behavior suggesting 
more general modulatory influence 
the striatum In contrast nbM
neurons discharge higher rates and are
phasically active with rapid alterations 
firing relation behavior The
loss neuronal system that exerts
tonic modulatory influences like the dopaminergic system may more amenable pharmacologic correction than the
loss neuronal system like the nbM 
which conveys spatially and temporally
coded information Successful approaches toward the treatment AD feasible will depend better delineation
 the synaptic organization physiology 
and function the cortical cholinergic
projections Animal models with selective lesions the basal forebrain cholinergic complex may prove useful for
preclinical testing potentially therapeutic agents 
The identification the neuronal systems affected AD now allows neuroscientists pose questions concerning
mechanisms responsible for the selective
degeneration It important determine what features the cholinergic noradrenergic somatostatin containing neurons and possibly other affected neuronal populations share common that
render them vulnerable the degenerative process In other words their
size extent axonal arbor type 
afferent input metabolic specialization? The interaction between age and
the expression selective vulnerability
remains critical issue that has relevance not only AD but other hereditary neurodegenerative disorders such

neuronal vulnerability may ultimately
lead the development treatments
