Differential Atrophy Hippocampal Subelds
Parkinson disease with dementia making differentiation between these disorders challenging Despite
the development consensus diagnostic criteria the
sensitivity for differential diagnosis DLB clinical
practice remains low with many DLB subjects misdiagnosed In light this uncertainty and with
important implications for subsequent patient management there need for reliable imaging markers
 help distinguish DLB from other subtypes dementia most especially AD 
Structural neuroimaging studies have found
reduced global atrophy DLB compared with AD 
The relative preservation the hippocampus DLB
compared with AD recognized one the most
consistent structural magnetic resonance imaging
 MRI ndings and has been incorporated 
supportive feature the revised criteria for the
diagnosis DLB 
Most previous studies however have compared
total hippocampal volumes using region interest

AD 
There have been few direct comparisons the

 the subiculum and regions the hippocampus DLB compared with AD although another
study did not any signicant difference hippocampal volumes As such the clinical utility 
hippocampal subeld volumetry aid the differential diagnosis DLB from AD remains unclear 
The discrepancy ndings the literature could
 attributed the variability methods that are
currently used examine the hippocampal subelds 
To date manual tracing widely acknowledged 
the gold standard hippocampal subeld delineation It labor intensive however and its reproducibility might limited inter intra rater
variability There also the possibility asymmetric
bias manual segmentations because laterality

 used validated and automated 
compare the volumetric differences the hippocampal subelds DLB and AD and investigate
their associations with memory performance

growing evidence suggesting that the neurodegenerative pathology not uniformly distributed
throughout the hippocampus the majority volumetric studies DLB and AD have considered the
hippocampus unitary structure Therefore 
appreciate the complex anatomical structure the
hippocampus used automated technique 
compare local volumetric differences the hippocampus DLB subjects with those AD and agematched HC subjects 
In accordance with previous estimates hippocampal atrophy ranging from 
demonstrated that AD subjects had smaller
hippocampal volumes relative HC subjects At the
subregional level found that the AD group had
signicant atrophy all hippocampal subelds
compared with both DLB and HC groups with the
exception the ssure Our nding corroborated
 previous imaging studies including postmortem
evidence indicating greater and
subiculum atrophy AD relative HC Taken
together the global pattern hippocampal atrophy
observed our AD group congruent with previous nding that subeld measurements may not
confer additional sensitivity over total hippocampus
volumes the detection AD 
The relative preservation the hippocampus 
DLB compared with AD agreement with the
 and with the different neuropsychological proles each group where memory decits
are more prominent AD Previous studies have
also suggested that DLB associated with lesser
pathology affecting the perforant pathways 
To date only few studies have compared atrophy
patterns the hippocampal subelds between DLB
and AD with considerable heterogeneity methodologies and ndings The mbria and ssure
were the most preserved regions our DLB subjects 
Notably the present results are partial agreement
with previous work from our group In that study 
 used manual drawing approach and reported 
lower degree atrophy affecting the and subiculum regions DLB compared with AD It 
noteworthy that our ndings despite different
methodologies automatic segmentation versus
manual tracing are also consistent with histopathological evidence DLB indicating that neuronal
loss and Lewy neurites are largely conned the
presubiculum and the with sparing the
 and subiculum regions Nevertheless two
previous studies using the hippocampal radial distance technique have reported increased atrophy
 rather than preservation the DLB relative
 HC Methodological differences the
anatomical delineations the subelds might account for the conicting ndings The well 
other hippocampal structures are parallel each
other and are organized along the anterior medial 
posterior lateral axis the hippocampus The hippocampal radiance distance technique which measures perpendicular directions this axis might
 limited its capacity reveal differential volume
changes and other subelds and fact 
overestimate the volume reduction due 
atrophy other parallel structures 
The hippocampus complex structure with
interconnected subelds having different projections 
The has extensive reciprocal projections with the
entorhinal cortex and emerging evidence from highresolution T and studies have
pointed toward critical involvement neurons
 episodic memory functions The preservation the
 region DLB subjects also parallels with significantly better memory function compared with AD
subjects our study Furthermore consistent with our
previous work the volumes our DLB group
were also signicantly associated with memory functions We are not aware other studies that have
examined correlations hippocampal subelds with
cognitive measures DLB 
Although previous study using the same Freesurfer technique has reported correlation between
hippocampal volumes and delayed recall scores 
AD did not any signicant association

the AD group with memory function most likely due
 oor effect memory performance In future 
the domain specic contribution hippocampal
subelds will better understood this automated
technique receives more recognition 
The major strengths the study include the
comprehensive neuropsychological assessment and 
well characterized group probable DLB and AD
subjects Furthermore light signicant disparities age sex and across comparison
groups previous studies extend the literature
 investigating cohort that was matched for age 
sex and educational level We also used publicly
available technique that capable segmenting the
hippocampal subelds reproducible and automatic fashion Thus are able address limitations associated with manual delineations the
hippocampus and the practical challenges processing large data sets Lastly this technique has also
been validated against manual volume estimations 
Nevertheless the operational denition the medial
boundaries varies between segmentation
protocols resulting smaller volume for
the Freesurfer technique compared with other
studies Also whereas this method reports 
combined volume others have reported separately and combined with 
and dentate gyrus In addition Van Leemput 
originally assessed hippocampal subelds with ultrahigh resolution MPRAGE slice thickness 
and enhanced signal noise ratio Consistent with
other studies used standard T MPRAGE
acquisition sequence slice thickness 
isotropic However this automated technique has
been used segment hippocampal subelds from
 T scans with much lower resolution and longer
acquisition time minutes Finally although this
technique has been widely applied neurodegenerative diseases the probabilistic atlas from Van
Leemput was built upon healthy subjects but
this inherent limitation many imaging studies
where common template necessary for the
investigation group differences Hence some
caution must exercised comparing ndings
between studies 
Additional potential limitations this study
include the lack neuropathological verication 
AD and DLB subject groups were based clinical diagnosis though this inherent limitation 
all antemortem imaging studies Furthermore 
have previously demonstrated good agreement between clinical and pathological diagnosis using the
consensus clinical diagnostic method adopted here 
CONCLUSIONS
To date very few studies have compared atrophy
patterns the hippocampal subelds DLB and
AD The main ndings preservation and
milder global hippocampal atrophy clinically
diagnosed DLB subjects are largely consistent with
the topography neuronal loss described histopathological studies well with previous imaging
studies The distinct involvement the DLB
and AD suggests that hippocampal subeld volumetry could promising biomarker aid the
differential diagnosis DLB
