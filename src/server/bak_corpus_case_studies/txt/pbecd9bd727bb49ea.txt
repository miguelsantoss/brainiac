 characterized senile plaques containing amyloid
peptide A derived from amyloid precursor protein APP 
and neurofibrillary tangles NFTs containing hyperphosphorylated protein A and phospho may neurotoxic leading 
progressive neuronal degeneration and death Despite progress
 understanding molecular mechanisms AD effective treatment remains elusive 
One potential approach treating AD involves using endogenous neuronal precursors replace lost damaged cells 
based the capacity the rostral subventricular zone SVZ 
and the subgranular zone SGZ the hippocampal dentate
gyrus DG generate neurons into adulthood Neuronal
stem cells the SVZ give rise predominantly committed
progenitor cells that migrate into the olfactory bulb OB via the
rostral migratory stream and differentiate into local interneurons progenitors the SGZ migrate into the granular cell
layer and also differentiate into neurons However the
migration newborn neurons not restricted these sites 
Endogenous neuronal precursors can proliferate response 
cerebral ischemia and migrate into ischemic regions 
striatum and cerebral cortex and into the region 
hippocampus where they may integrate into existing brain
circuitry and contribute repair These neurons may have
 physiological role because blockade hippocampal neurogenesis reported inhibit hippocampus dependent learning
 and because reducing the population new interneurons
 the OB impairs odor discrimination 
The proliferation neuronal stem progenitor cells the
adult brain also affected growth factors including epidermal growth factor EGF fibroblast growth 
 brain derived neurotrophic factor 
stem cell factor heparin binding EGF HB EGF and

Discussion
Here report increased expression immature neuronal
marker proteins hippocampus AD brains with immunohistochemical localization hippocampal sites neurogenesis
 DG and AD pathology The regulated proteins
included DCX PSA NCAM and NeuroD Our findings
are consistent with increased hippocampal neurogenesis AD 
 has been documented other neuropathological states such
 ischemia and which may represent mechanism directed
toward the replacement dead damaged neurons 
Although brain atrophy which occurs AD can spuriously
affect measurements protein concentration this factor 
unlikely explain our results Actin expression used 
control was unchanged AD brains and the expression
patterns the neuronal marker proteins that studied varied 
For example DCX and PSA NCAM expression increased with
increasing disease severity calbindin expression was unchanged 
and NeuN expression was characterized altered banding
pattern which lower Mr bands became more and higher Mr
bands less prominent the severity AD increased Moreover 
immunohistochemistry showed increased expression DCX
and the dentate GCL from patients with AD 
contrast Ammons horn this area hippocampus not
prominently affected AD 
Prior studies establish that neurogenesis occurs the
adult mammalian brain although reduced rate with advancing age Nevertheless the aged brain retains the capacity 
 regulate neurogenesis response physiological and
pathological factors This finding contrasts with the hematopoietic system where basal production new cells remains
fairly constant with age whereas the hematopoietic response 
stress attenuated In conditions like AD which occurs 
increasing frequency with advancing age the ability the aged
brain mobilize new neurons offers the prospect cell

replacement This result could have especially important consequences the hippocampus because this brain region 
disproportionately affected AD and because memory function which prominently impaired AD may depend 
hippocampal neurogenesis Although current evidence
connects neurogenesis with improved function slower disease
progression AD tempting speculate that the ability 
N methyl D aspartate NMDA receptor inhibition enhance
dentate neurogenesis might contribute the therapeutic
effects NMDA antagonist drugs like memantine patients
with AD 
Our results contrast with findings transgenic models AD 
 which mice expressing mutant forms APP 
 show impaired rather than increased neurogenesis However none these models fully reproduces the
features familial AD let alone those sporadic AD which
our patients are statistically most likely have had Because the
molecular stimulus neurogenesis AD other neurological
disorders unknown impossible predict whether animal
models that may more closely resemble human AD such 
APP double transgenic mice would more likely 
show enhanced neurogenesis but this possibility worth
exploring

Notwithstanding that neurogenesis appears increased 
the brains patients with AD progressive cell loss still
observed There are several possible reasons for the limited
repair capacity neurogenesis AD First the rate extent
 cell loss may too great for quantitatively significant
replacement achieved Second the neurons that are
produced may ineffectual because they not develop into
fully mature functional neurons because they not develop
into the right type neurons because they are incapable 
integrating into the surviving brain circuitry Third the microenvironment the AD brain may toxic new neurons 
If the human AD brain can support neurogenesis appears 
 the case then measures that increase neurogenesis could have
therapeutic value One such measure may environmental
enrichment which stimulates neurogenesis aged mice 
Another the administration growth factors such IGF I
 HB EGF which also increase neurogenesis
