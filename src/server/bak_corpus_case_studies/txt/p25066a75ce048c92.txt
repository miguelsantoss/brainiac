ABSTRACT 
Numerous studies have reported smaller hippocampal
volume Alzheimers disease AD patients than aging controls 
However mild cognitive impairment MCI the results are inconsistent Moreover the left right asymmetry the hippocampus receives
less research attention In this article meta analyses are designed 
determine the extent hippocampal atrophy MCI and AD and 
evaluate the asymmetry pattern the hippocampal volume control 
MCI and AD groups From studies including MCI patients and
 controls signicant atrophy found both the left Effect size
 ES condence interval CI and right ES 
 CI hippocampus which lower than that AD ES 
 CI left ES CI right 
Comparing with aging controls the average volume reduction weighted
 sample size and left and right hippocampus 
MCI and and left and right hippocampus AD 
respectively The ndings show bilateral hippocampal volume loss 
MCI and the extent atrophy less than that AD By comparing the
left and right hippocampal volume consistent left less than right

 In AD patients numerous neuroimaging
studies reported structural brain abnormalities and
hippocampal atrophy was taken consistent nding
 Chetelat and Baron Hippocampal volume
and its change were proven effective predicting disease progression and AD diagnosis Mungas
 Anstey and Maller den Heijer
As better representation the clinical manifestation incipient AD the criteria mild cognitive
impairment MCI was developed Petersen 
 Petersen The rate developing
AD MCI per year much higher than
that normal elderly subjects which about 
per year Pennanen Consequently investigating the hippocampal volume atrophy MCI and
the comparison magnitude and extent atrophy
between MCI and AD attract great interest recently 
because has the potential provide measure for
tracking the disease progression and understand the
pathogenesis In MCI many studies reported bilateral
hippocampal atrophy Wolf Hsu 
 Anstey and Maller Wang 
Pennanen Wolf Jessen 
 However there were also some inconsistent
results Muller found signicant lower
volume only existed the left hippocampus and
Zhang reported smaller hippocampal volume only the right side In several longitudinal
studies total hippocampal volume was reported 
reduced the following order control MCI 
AD Pennanen Jessen and
the hippocampal volume MCI converters AD
was signicantly smaller than MCI nonconverters
 Devanand In general there are many
previous studies that have investigated the hippocampal volume MCI and AD patients but studies 
the statistical analysis the magnitude and extent 
hippocampal volumetric reduction are relatively rare 
and the ndings are also affected limited sample
size especially longitudinal studies 
To address this issue introduce the meta analysis determine the magnitude and extent hippocampal volume MCI and AD studies integrating the results relevant cross sectional studies and
SHI ET AL 
overcoming the effect small sample size single study 
Meta analysis well established statistic method and widely
used brain and hippocampus volumetric studies depression Campbell Videbech and Ravnkilde 
Schizophrenia Boos Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
 PTSD Karl etc Instead simply summarizing
the previous studies results meta analysis denes effect size
 represent the quantitative ndings each study and allow
the comparisons across studies 
Meanwhile increasing evidence indicates that pathological
factors may lead asymmetry brain Toga and Thompson 
 Nardi and Bingman Wolf reported
signicant left less than right hippocampal asymmetry controls and MCI patients Barnes found nonsignicant trend left less than right asymmetry controls and
the rst scan AD patients but the asymmetry was not
remained the follow scan months later These studies indicate the asymmetry the left and right hippocampal
volume exists and may varies with disease progression and thus
additional meta analyses hippocampal asymmetry were
adopted address this issue 
In this study conduct meta analyses the cross sectional
MRI studies which contain volumetric analysis the hippocampus MCI AD patients Our aims are summarize the previous hippocampal volume studies MCI and AD
patients and establish the extent hippocampal atrophy 
 examine the moderating variables that might contribute 
the discrepancies and investigate the asymmetry patterns
 the hippocampus controls MCI and AD patients 
METHODS
Considering the MRI techniques were developed rapidly and
the value earlier volumetric studies with older imaging paradigms might largely diminished studies published before
the year were not included Seventeen studies showed
their hippocampal volume results with only gures provided
only the total hippocampal volume left plus right For these
studies contacted the authors request the detailed data
via email Five studies were remained this manner Head

 Zhang If the same subjects were
used different studies only one study with the largest sample
was included Laakso One study Murphy
 reporting excessive hippocampal atrophy was discarded for highly bias the following sensitive test In the
remaining studies the minimum number samples 
patient and control group was No studies were excluded
based the sample size but sample size correction was introduced the following effect size denition

Data Analysis
Data analyzed using the RevMan software supplied
 Cochrane Collaboration http www ims net RevMan 
For each study effect size calculated Hedges which 
similar the metric Cohen Cohen but includes 
adjustment for small sample size bias Hedges and Olkin 
 The formula follows 
Ni 
Hippocampus
SHI ET AL 
Ni 
where the ith study and are the mean hippocampal
volume the control group and patient group respectively 
 and are the standard derivation SD the pooled
standard deviation and are the number subjects 
two groups respectively and Ni the number total subjects
 the ith study Ni 
Effect size ES can interpreted terms the percent 
nonoverlap score distributions two groups An ES 
indicate the distribution volume for two groups are totally
overlapped ES and indicate nonoverlap rate
 and referring small medium and
large effects respectively Cohen The higher ES value
 the larger difference found two groups 
After computing the individual effect sizes use random
effects model weigh the studies inverse variance
method In this way can obtain combined effect size 
which indicates the magnitude the association across all
studies The formulas are follows 
P
 P
Ni
SEi 
 Ni 
where the effect size the ith study the inverse variance weight and SEi the standard error 
Thus the weighted combined effect size and its condence interval CI can obtained A larger effect size means
 greater difference the hippocampal volume between the
two groups If CI contains means that signicant difference exists 
In addition the homogeneity statistic Q calculated 
assess the variance results across studies follows 
Q
X
Q distributed the number studies A signicant Q statistic indicates that studies cannot share
 common population effect size they are heterogenous 
In this case further analysis needed investigate potential
moderating factors 
In the following asymmetry analysis the left and right hippocampal volumes are compared which are dependent groups
 called correlated design Rosnow and Rosenthal 
Hedges employed calculate the effect size There are
Hippocampus
some arguments how compute the pooled SD Mullen
and Rosenthal Rosenthal Dunlop 
In this study choose the original standard deviations instead
 the paired test value avoid overestimating the actual
effect size Dunlop 
Sensitivity analysis conducted ensure that single
study will bias the combined results removing one study
each time and recalculating the combined effect size the
remaining studies Usually published studies tend biased
toward positive ndings and nonsignicant nding may not
 published This will cause the drawer problem Fail safe
number introduced assess this publication bias The failsafe number nfs signies the minimum number unpublished
studies with nonsignicant ndings that needed overturn the
conclusion the meta analysis A larger fail safe number
means the results are safer from publication bias Orwin has

Moderator Variables
Two factors may largely inuence heterogeneity this study 
namely head size correction methods and disease severities In
many studies hippocampus volume provided directly raw
volume To account for variations head size among subjects 
some studies normalize hippocampus volume total intracranial volume TIV also known intracranial volume ICV 
dened the sum the whole brain volume WBV and the
CSF volume Some other studies also control hippocampus volume coronal intracranial area ICA the level the anterior commissure A subgroup analysis performed evaluate
the effect the heterogeneity raw volume and two head size
correction methods the hippocampal volume AD and
MCI analysis 
MMSE Mini Mental State Examination score always
taken indicator disease severity and provided MCI and
AD studies In MCI studies mean MMSE score each study
ranged from Mean SD suggesting that
subjects might have similar cognitive level But AD studies 
 ranged from Mean SD suggesting
that both mild and moderate Alzheimers disease were included
 these studies The heterogeneity disease severity may confound the ndings Alzheimers disease Thus subgroup
analysis designed address the effect the severity heterogeneity the hippocampal volume dividing AD into two
groups The studies whose mean MMSE score are larger than
 were classied mild AD group and others moderate

DISCUSSION
Through these meta analyses signicant bilateral hippocampal atrophy validated both MCI and AD patients Fig 
The extent hippocampal volume loss MCI smaller than
that AD which partially supports the fact that MCI 
transitional stage AD In the asymmetry analysis left less

than right pattern found consistently but with different
extents all three groups namely MCI AD and controls 
The disturbance hippocampus asymmetry may characteristic that suggests the onset illness 
The heterogeneity studies may come from the following
aspects Variations MRI acquisition protocols In this article the included studies used T MR machine and the
obtained slice thickness exceeded studies 
Toledo Morrell Dixon Sandstrom
 Variations hippocampal boundary delineation methods Anstey and Maller Campbell 
 In most studies hippocampus was manually traced 
 neuroanatomists trained operators coronal oblique
images acquired perpendicular the long axis the body 
the hippocampus according anatomical guidelines The raters
were claimed blind the diagnoses and neuropsychological
performance all subjects but not blinded hemisphere left
 right The intra inter rater reliability was reported
higher than Variations the characteristics AD
patients different studies such disease severity cognitive
prole family history and genetic variations like ApoE allele

distribution For example the study Ridha was
based autosomal dominant AD patients while dominant
inheritance AD patients were included Basso 
Only four studies provided the Apo E allele distribution 
their subjects around Variations head size correction methods A total studies directly provided the
raw volume hippocampus Table However would 
reasonable consider the inuence whole brain volume 
hippocampus volume A total studies corrected hippocampus volume with total intracranial volume TIV which was
independent with brain atrophy and was proved good
measurement for premorbid brain size and therefore better
measure for adjusting individual differences brain size Other
 studies corrected their volume with the area specic slice 
 coronal intracranial area the level the anterior commissure ICA for which the accuracy was affected the slice
chosen So TIV correction method recommended use 
future hippocampus volumetric studies because takes the intracranial volume into account and more reasonable than area
correction method 
We signicant hippocampal atrophy MCI and AD

correlations have been found between neuron number and total
hippocampal volume both AD patients and aging subjects

studies Jessen Ridha Wolf 
 the right hippocampus was found signicantly
Hippocampus
larger than the left the controls and MCI but not AD 
which indicates the asymmetry was the least AD group In 
longitudinal study Barnes left less than right
pattern was found the baseline AD patients but this
result was not repeated follow scan conducted 
months later which suggested the asymmetry AD was
reduced with disease progression A neonatal study found the
preterm infants tended have less asymmetrical hippocampus
than full term infants Thompson And males
with schizophrenia established nonsignicant hippocampus volume asymmetry whereas the control subjects did Fukuzako
 The abnormal disturbance found MCI and
AD patients this study may state characteristic and this
feature may have the potential used tracing the progression this disease 
There are several limitations our meta analyses One limitation the publication bias Because some relevant studies
may not included the MEDLINE database and inevitably
missed this study Fail safe number employed assess this
bias Second MCI has many subtypes In which amnestic
MCI was recognized the closest Alzheimers disease In
cross sectional MCI analyses this article only studies
declare their patient subtype amnestic MCI which not
sufcient conduct meta analysis Third hippocampus
delineation many studies report that their raters are blind 
clinical neuropsychological data but most them are not
blind hemisphere left right The left right hippocampus
asymmetry found this study may affected raters handedness But considering the asymmetry obtained integrating many relevant studies and signicant trend also got
when comparing asymmetry degree MCI and AD the asymmetry found still meaningful Fourth the combined effect
sizes are obtained putting together all relevant studies AD
and MCI analyses Note that the subgroup analyses are also
provided and that effect sizes has similar magnitude with the
overall results appropriate get this combined effect size
for overview the degree hippocampus atrophy AD
and MCI analyses 
In summary from the aspect the extent hippocampal
volume loss our results partly support the hypothesis that MCI
 transitional stage between normal people and AD Our
study also shows the consistent left less than right asymmetry
 the aging control MCI and AD groups but their different
extents suggest the asymmetry may change dynamically according
 disease progression These ndings obtained this study may
 helpful tracing hippocampus change from normal people 
severe AD patients longitudinally and providing more candidate
markers for predicting MCI and AD
