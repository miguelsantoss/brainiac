Differences the pattern hippocampal neuronal loss normal
ageing and Alzheimers disease
Summary
Introduction
The distinction between the neurodegenerative changes that
accompany normal ageing and those that characterise
Alzheimers disease not clear The resolution this issue
has important implications for the design therapeutic and
investigative strategies To this end have used modern
stereological techniques compare the regional pattern 
neuronal cell loss the hippocampus related normal ageing
 that associated with Alzheimers disease 
The loss related normal ageing was evaluated from
estimates the total number neurons each the major
hippocampal subdivisions normal ageing subjects who
ranged age from years The Alzheimers disease
related losses were evaluated from similar data obtained from
 cases Alzheimers disease and age matched controls 
Qualitative differences were observed the regional patterns
 neuronal loss related normal ageing and Alzheimers
disease The most distinctive Alzheimers disease related
neuron loss was seen the region the hippocampus In
the normal ageing group there was almost neuron loss 
this region final neuron count the region middot X 
neurons for the Alzheimers disease group middot times 
neurons the normal ageing group 
It concluded that the neurodegenerative processes
associated with normal ageing and with Alzheimers disease
are qualitatively different and that Alzheimers disease not
accelerated ageing but distinct pathological process

Our study focuses the hippocampal region located

one the first develop the neuropathological signs AD
and advanced cases the region most profoundly
affected Because the hippocampal region also
involved aspects memory processes that deteriorate

the region would appropriate part the brain 
which compare degenerative changes related AD and

The patterns degeneration were evaluated terms

neurofibrillary tangles neuronal loss reflects the
cumulative tissue damage accrued with age and AD 
There are few reliable reports AD and age related 
because methods for making precise estimates the total
number neurons localised areas the brain were not
available when most these studies were done Data

Results
Methods
Estimates were made the total number neurons each the
major subdivisions the hippocampal region one side the
brain histological material obtained necropsy from male
subjects Before the tissue was removed the brains were fixed 
 formalin for between months and two years The tissue
samples were divided into two groups the normal ageing group 
which included samples from subjects who had history 
long term illness dementia neurological disease mean age 
analysis
Normal age related neuronal loss was evaluated for each
subdivision testing the regression total neuron number with
age using the data from the individuals the normal ageing group 
Regressions with values less than were defined 
statistically significant For subdivisions which there were
significant negative relationships neuronal loss was expressed 
terms the ratio the predicted neuronal number the oldest
and youngest ages represented the normal ageing group 
AD related neuronal loss was evaluated for each subdivision with
unpaired tests done the numerical data from subjects the

The mean number neurons the hilus and the

pronounced AD related reduction neuron number was
observed CA where average neurons were
lost and where there was virtually overlap between the
estimates the individuals the AD group and those 
the age matched control group In the subiculum and hilus 
the AD related reductions were and 
respectively beyond those attributed normal ageing 
Although the means the number neurons the dentate

The regional pattern neuronal loss the AD group 
qualitatively and quantitatively different from that
observed the normal ageing group We noticed ADrelated neuronal loss two subdivisions that normally lose
neurons with age the hilus and the subiculum but also
noticed neuronal loss region which there 
evidence normal age related loss The CAl neuron loss
related AD was greater than that any other subdivision
and there was overlap between the numbers CAl
neurons and the AD and aged control groups In two
individuals from the AD group CAlwas essentially void 
neurons The loss neurons the AD group can
only explained the involvement process not
involved normal ageing It therefore constitutes evidence
for qualitative difference the regional pattern 
neuronal loss the AD and normal ageing groups and
argues against the hypothesis AD accelerated ageing 
Our results indicate that AD not inevitable
consequence ageing While this may comforting 
also implies that the study normal ageing processes
cannot lead complete understanding the degenerative
mechanisms involved AD AD involves specific disease
process which needs understood provide basis for
specific therapeutic and preventative strategies Because
AD undeniably linked with age but not necessarily with
the ageing process the brain the disease may involve 
Discussion
Because this
longitudinal study with only one
subject cannot rule out that the
are related secular changes and
differences
age related
that differences the AD and age matched control groups
were present from early age and not represent
progressive losses neurons over time It possible 
argue against the secular interpretation the normal
ageing data the basis the non heterogeneity the
regional losses discussed elsewhere The longitudinal
study Jobst describing progressive atrophy the
medial lobe individual AD patients argues favour 
the interpretation AD and age matched control group
differences evidence neuronal loss Significant
negative regressions for neuron number versus age the
normal ageing group have consequently been discussed

independent pathological process that proceeds for years 
decades before manifesting itself clinically and

diagnostic indices long before the clinical signs AD

described here most likely associated with this phase
