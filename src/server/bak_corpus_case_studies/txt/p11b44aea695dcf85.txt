Spin valve sensors with dimensions were
fabricated with the structure Si 
 with average MR
 Six sensors per chip were integrated within the final
current line structure each sensor having two associated current lines The width sensor line connections was stepped
down sensor sites from the sensor pads 
while current lines were tapered from sections adjacent the sensors Figs The chip surface was passivated with layer silicon dioxide 
Approximately chips were fabricated per 
silicon wafer and cut using dicing saw Individual chips
were then mounted pin chip carriers and the electrical
connections made via wire bonding the contact pads Wire
bonded areas were protected using silicon gel The
mounted chip was then connected multimeter and three
power sources one for the sensor line and two for its associated current lines Magnetic label movements chip and
corresponding sensor resistance changes were observed simultaneously positioning the chip carrier the stage

 phosphate buffer mM containing low label
concentrations which were applied the chip using autopipette The spin valve transfer curve was linearized with
its sense current mA An plane magnetic field perpendicular the length the sensor created horseshoe
magnet current Oe was also used induce measurable moment within the superparamagnetic labels Control experiments were performed using fluid samples without
magnetic labels under identical conditions determine any
potential background signal contributions These included
the addition fluid and other environmental temperature

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In preliminary experiments demonstrate the use 
current line structures control the movement magnetic
labels simple aluminum tapered line was constructed 
starting with width and with central section 
narrower width This was then immersed fluid
containing Nanomag D labels and current 
mA was passed through the line The labels were seen 
move the line while current was passing and move
away from the line after the current was switched off Furthermore the labels tended move more readily the nar

rower section the line where the local magnetic field generated was higher This principle was then used design
various chip current line structures which evolved into
the structure shown Fig Currents mA were
passed through the tapering current lines focus labels

then moved and from the sensor switching the current

Both and labels could detected bulk
numbers using this approach The initial average MR
signals mA sense current were mV and 
mV respectively The observed signals for
Nanomag D were higher due the smaller size and hence
higher density labels that can accumulate the sensor
surface The moment values per unit weight were 
emu labels and emu labels while
the relative moment values for single labels calculated

emu label An immediate disadvantage the
use Nanomag D labels was their tendency 
cluster readily external field preventing the determination single label signals However Micromer M microspheres could controlled and detected single labels 
Subsequently all additional detection experiments were performed using Micromer M labels The real time detection

can seen Fig Spectroscopic assays the activity 
these labels indicated active molecules HRP per
label depending the particular conditions the immobilization procedure shows equivalent chart for
the movement and detection Micromer M labels with
immobilized streptavidin These plots and additional data
were used calculate average detection signals for labels and saturation signals for different sensors labels

was typically V saturation These signals were
found reproducible with respect sensor and chip As
 means comparison performed theoretical calculations
for the signal based the magnetic moment single label
positioned directly above the sensor This resultant
value was V but this represents maximum signal
and assumes that there fluid between the label and the
sensor surface 
CONCLUSIONS
The present work provides means move and detect

successfully demonstrated the detection single magnetic microspheres with small number active biomolecules attached Our present goal use this system 
demonstrate the detection the binding streptavidin functionalized magnetic labels sensor bound biotin which
will demonstrate the use this system detect biomolecular recognition and provide vehicle for the placement detection and study other biomolecules and other biomolecular interactions particular single DNA molecule
