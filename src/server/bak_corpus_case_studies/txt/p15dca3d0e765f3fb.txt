Introduction
Brain imaging has played variety roles the study 
Alzheimers disease AD over the past four decades Initially 
computed tomography CT and then magnetic resonance imaging MRI were used diagnostically rule out other causes
 dementia such vascular non Alzheimer neurodegeneration well reversible dementias More recently variety imaging modalitiesincluding structural and functional MRI and positron emission tomography PET studies
 cerebral metabolism and amyloid plaque tracers via specific
radioligandshave shown characteristic changes the brains
 AD patients Changes also appear the prodromal and
presymptomatic stages making easier rule out the
AD pathophysiological process 
Brain Imaging and Behavior
Increasing evidence from structural and functional MRI
studies suggests that Alzheimers disease and mild cognitive
impairment may target specific brain networks deToledoMorrell Structural imaging can detect the time
course brain atrophying patients with Alzheimers disease and may serve surrogate marker for pathological
changes people suspected having AD 
In broad terms structural MRI AD can utilized 
assess atrophy volumes and changes tissue characteristics These cause signal alterations certain sequences
such white matter hyperintensitieson the weighted
MRI result gliotic lesions secondary vascular damage A number MR sequences that are sensitive microstructural change magnetization transfer diffusion 
have shown alterations AD Volumetric MRI becoming
 increasingly important tool the early detection and care
 people suspected having mild cognitive impairment 
Alzheimers disease Scheltens 
MRIbased measures atrophy are regarded valid
markers diseases state and progression for several reasons Marizzoni Progressive atrophy considered counterpart concomitant neurodegeneration and disease evolution cognitive decline Moreover the topography
 brain tissue loss correlates with cognitive deficits both
cross sectionally and longitudinally Patients with
Alzheimers disease may express typical pathologic changes
 cortical gray matter characterized the accumulation 
amyloid beta plaques the formation neurofibrillary tangles 
and neuronal and synaptic loss Delacourte All
these changes lead cerebral atrophy specific brain regions
and networks The pattern neuronal synaptic depauperation
differs across various forms dementia reflecting selective
vulnerability and regional disease expression and becoming increasingly clear thatby the time typical AD
patient receives diagnosisregions within his her brain
have already been atrophying for several years well before
symptom onset This partially contrasted the neural 
synaptic reserve and plasticity see for review DAmelio
and Rossini In patients with Alzheimers disease atrophy has been found occur the hippocampal formation and
entorhinal cortex has been demonstrated several volumetric MRI studies Apostolova Du 
Killiany Wolz Zimny 
Actually the vast majority structural brain imaging studies
have been based histopathological evidence that the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus are among the first sites impacted the disease during its pre symptomatic stages including Mild Cognitive Impairment MCI 
Among the different MRI markers AD Modrego 
the rate whole brain and hippocampal atrophy assessed
 high resolution weighted MRI well established and
validated and increasingly being used outcome measure clinical trials experimenting with potentially disease 
modifying therapies Recently three dimensional gradientecho sequences have allowed for the calculation volumes
and the registration images during the follow phase
and have been used clinical practice Whitwell 
Despite their convoluted structure the boundaries the hippocampal formation and adjacent CSF spaces are easier for
human operators automated algorithms recognize than
the amygdala entorhinal cortex parahippocampal gyrus 
This because the anatomical boundaries the hippocampus
are distinct high resolution weighted MRI scans around
most the surface the structure 
Unlike weighted imaging relaxometry allows for
the quantitative measurement signal changes weighted images However the ability weighted imaging differentiate MCI from AD and Nold limited because
various confounding pathologiessuch brain edema demyelination and axonal lossmay also result changes
similar those seen Alzheimers disease Early reports
used serial manual detection the anatomical boundaries 
the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex Pitkanen 
Hippocampal volume measured vivo MRI correlates
with the Braak stage and neuronal counts Bobinski 
 Gosche Jack Patients with
MCI have smaller entorhinal cortex and hippocampus than
healthy age matched subjects However patients with AD
may experience prominent volume reduction the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus During the mild AD stage hippocampal volume already reduced relative 
controls van der Flier and the amnestic variant
 MCI the volume reduced Barnes 
Shi Furthermore new Alzheimers disease
criteria allow for earlier diagnosis the disease including biomarkers derived from cerebrospinal fluid hippocampal volume analysis Dubois Dubois 
Altogether structural MRIs can help support clinical diagnosis but unfortunately such techniques are not sufficient 
establish definitive diagnosis often the overlap between
atrophy associated with Bhealthy aging and AD too great 
Characteristics neural firing synchronization the oscillating rhythms resting eyes closed electroencephalographic EEG recordings have been repeatedly demonstrated
 become abnormal during the pre clinical and clinical AD
stages Vecchio Vecchio Moreover 
 was demonstrated that network analysis the EEG recordings could improve the discrimination AD and that
this analysis could correlate with the structural brain data revealed DTI Vecchio Vecchio

concept small world networks allowing for optimal

findings It also allows researchers evaluate whether the
functional connectivity patterns between brain areas reproduce the organization more less strongly connected networks based the time varying strength synchronization

Within this theoretical frame our working hypothesis was
that hippocampal atrophy and the functional network the
cortical sources resting EEG rhythms could inter related 
Consequently the aim this study was determine whether
the BSmall World connectivity characteristic the ratio
between Clustering and Path Length namely the evaluation
 this optimal balance between local specialization and global
integration the resting state brain networks correlated with

algorithm linear inverse solution for EEG signals 
Because has localization error points sources under
ideal noise free conditions Pascual Marqui 
The eLORETA method discrete three dimensionally
 D distributed linear weighted minimum norm inverse solution The particular weights used endow the tomography
with the property exact localization test point sources 
yielding images current density with exact localization 
albeit with low spatial resolution neighboring neuronal
sources will highly correlated The description the
method and the proof its exact zero error localization property are described Pascual Marqui It also important
 emphasize that eLORETA has localization bias even 
the presence structured noise It should further emphasized that the localization properties any linear D inverse
solution tomography can always determined localization errors test point sources If such tomography has
zero localization error such point sources located anywhere
 the brain thenexcept the case low spatial resolutionthe tomography will correctly localize any arbitrary D
distribution This due the principles linearity and
superposition

 integration A well designed anatomical network could combine the occurrence functionally specialized segregated 
modules with robust number intermodular integrating 
links Such design commonly termed Small World and
indeed appears ubiquitous facet anatomical connectivity It commonly thought that such organization reflects optimal balance functional integration and segregation Sporns and Honey Many studies investigated
the topological changes brain networks with different modalities including structural MRI diffusion tensor imaging

brain functional topography can represented progressive derangement network organization hub regions and

Within this frame the present study demonstrated that resting state Small World characteristics several EEG frequency bands correlate with hippocampal volume It concluded
that such Small World pattern might represent functional
counterpart structural brain modifications AD In fact 
the aim the present study was evaluate possible correlation between Small World characteristics brain connectivity and hippocampal volume Results show that quantitatively more correlations were observed the right hemisphere but with the some trend both hemispheres In particular alpha bands were negatively correlated while low and

In line with previous evidence clear that reduction

 the different EEG frequency bands It was already demonstrated Vecchio and has been hereby replicatedthat significant small worldness difference distinguish
normal elderly subjects from AD patients for instance 
hereby confirmed that normal aging presents higher specialization Small World band characteristics with higher values
 lower frequencies and lower values alpha bands Here 
correlation analysis has shown that the reduction hippocampal volume combined loss the Small World specialization the EEG frequency bands In other words the Small
World could present less spread values The present
results provide preliminary view these relationships and
should taken into account also for other kinds dementia

Of note regarding the possibility bias due the common feeding effect described previous literature Blinowska
and Kaminski Kaminski the methods used
 the present work tried avoid the bias more connections
 specific brain regions explained common feeding from
electrodes generating multitude false connections
between electrodes Blinowska and Kaminski 
well known thatfor instancethe sources the resting
state eyes closed EEG are located the posterior regions 
the brain with smaller contributions frontal areas therefore
implementing weighted graph for the proposed analyses and
avoiding aggregation connection spotted brain regions
while considering all the possible connections with weight 
Furthermore general limitation the present study 
the low number EEG channels should considered It was
also reported that many studies used the same number electrodes but replication the present study with large number electrode derivations should provided Meanwhile 
findings with standard number EEG recording channelsas used routine clinical activityare encouraging
for large scale future clinical applications 
Some points need discussed more specifically The
first the functional relationships between hippocampal volume and cortical sources regarding the network delta and
alpha rhythms Cholinergic basal forebrain neurons medial
septum heavily project the hippocampus and the amygdala 
which are connected the cortical mantle abundant noncholinergic projections Selden These cholinergic
pathways would drive cortico cortical and thalamocortical
loops converge cortical pyramidal neurons that generate
low band Hz alpha EEG oscillations representing
the dominant rhythms the human brain waking rest
 Klimesch Steriade and Llinas Klimesch
 Ricceri Rossini To support
this view has been reported that the cholinergic basal forebrain was more structurally impaired AD patients Teipel
 especially non responders cholinergic therapy Tanaka Finally alpha and delta rhythms
were found abnormally modulated AD patients 
function disease severity and opposite ways see Vecchio
 In particular posterior cortical alpha rhythms
were correlated with hippocampal volume Babiloni 
 The complex interaction the aforementioned factors
accounts for the present finding correlations between normalized hippocampal volume and the organization the cortical delta and alpha source networks revealed Small
World characteristics 
A second main observation that hippocampal atrophy
was not significantly correlated cortical source networks
 EEG theta rhythms It has been revealed that theta rhythms
functionally connect the hippocampal amygdala systems and
the cortex Buzsaki and Draguhn Selden 
Moreover cholinergic projection into the hippocampus regulates the hippocampal theta rhythms Andersen 
Kimura Accordingly can speculated that hippocampal volume would not affect interactions between the basal forebrain pathways projecting the hippocampus 
amygdala and those directly projecting the cerebral cortex
 mainly modulated alpha rhythms Thus the theta rhythms
that modulate the cortical networks are mainly maintained
with respect the hippocampal volume least the considered level atrophy 
Finally the correlation the high frequency bands beta
and gamma builds upon previous evidence similar correlation between gamma Small World reduction and memory
decline revealed specific memory tests Vecchio 
 Despite general acceptance the idea that memory 
not localized one specific neural structure there overwhelming evidence that the medial temporal lobe MTL 
and particularly the hippocampal relays play central role
 memory performance via interactions with distributed

and Milner Here moving from the idea that any
normal sized structure will support normal function and
vice versa Van possible speculate that the atrophy the hippocampus could lead memory impairment

Conclusions
Understanding the role EEG oscillations play the network
dynamics AD patients important for comprehending
mechanisms cognitive decline and could serve model
for understanding large scale brain network dynamics and their
relation other cognitive phenomena structural modulations The hippocampal atrophy comes along with the background histo pathophysiological alterations AD All these
signs neurodegeneration are mirrored the small world
disorganization and lead the cognitive impairment that has
been clinically assessed This study opens interesting avenues
into future researches investigating eventual modifications
