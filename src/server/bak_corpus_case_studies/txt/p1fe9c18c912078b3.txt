ABSTRACT In patients with Alzheimers disease addition the core symptoms cognitive
dysfunction behavioral and psychological symptoms dementia BPSD such aggression anxiety and
hallucinations are known occur frequently Because various environmental factors influence the onset
and progression Alzheimers disease the present study BPSD like behavioral abnormality Amyloid A injected mice was assessed under social isolation which induces behavioral abnormality A protein pmol was injected into the lateral ventricle mice which were individually housed 
Two and three weeks after injection into adult mice the rate mice that exhibited aggressive behavior 
 biting attacks and wrestling the total mice was markedly increased A injection A injected
adult mice also showed anxiety like behavior addition cognitive decline Serum corticosterone level was markedly increased A injection When excitability hippocampal neurons was checked using
hippocampal slices KCl induced presynaptic activity was enhanced hippocampal slices prepared from
A injected mice These results suggest that social isolation housing A injected adult mice induces BPSD like behavioral abnormality addition cognitive decline It likely that behavioral abnormality A injected adult mice associated with excitability hippocampal glutamatergic neurons which associated with the elevated corticosterone level

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimers disease progressive neurodegenerative disorder that characterized the presence 
senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles together with
synaptic and neuronal loss Terry The major
component senile plaques amyloid A proteins 
which comprises peptides approximately amino
acid residues derived from the transmembrane amyloid
precursor protein APP Selkoe A can exist 
monomers and form variety different aggregate morphologies including dimers small soluble oligomers protofibrils diffuse plaques and the fibrillar deposits seen 
senile plaques The aggregation A peptide widely considered the critical step the pathology 
Alzheimers disease Small soluble A oligomers have
been shown more neurotoxic than large insoluble

behavioral and psychological symptoms dementia BPSD such aggression anxiety and hallucinations often emerge BPSD serious problem for caregivers and because its severity and the care burden
show positive correlation therapy for BPSD considered important therapy for the core symptoms
 Nagaratnam Tanji Among
BPSD agitation and aggression occur over 
patients with dementia Mirakhur and are frequently the primary cause hospitalization institutionalization Steele Non pharmacological interventions such environmental changes are proposed 
the first line treatment for BPSD although medical therapy often required Mizukami 
On the other hand various environmental and genetic
factors influence the onset and progression Alzheimers
disease Green possible that environmental changes are closely linked the pathophysiology BPSD Social isolation housing rodents causes
 variety behavioral changes including hyperlocomotion anxiety impulsivity aggression and learning and
memory deficits Koike However behavioral abnormality and pathophysiology induced with A has
been mainly studied focusing core symptoms and the
involvement social isolation pathogenesis BPSD
 poorly understood Sekiguchi 
In the present study BPSD like behavioral abnormality
was examined mice after intracerebroventricular injection A which were housed individually

Open field test

two enclosed arms that were extended
from central platform elevated above
the floor The room light was covered with translucent

allowed freely explore the maze for min Behavior
 each mouse was monitored using video camera The
total times spent the open arms and the closed arms
were measured The ratio time spent the open

Object recognition memory
Mice were placed for min into open field which
was arena surrounded high walls 
made black colored plastic Twenty four hours after
open field exploration mice were trained and tested 
novel object recognition task Training the object recognition task took place the same area used for the
open field exploration The open field exploration was
thus used context habituation trial for the recognition memory task The object recognition test requires
that the mice recall which two earthenware objects
they had been previously familiarized with Twenty four
hours after arena exploration training was conducted 
placing individual mice into the field which two identical objects objects and were positioned two
adjacent corners from the walls Mice were left

for the test when the total the object exploration time
was less than sec In the test given after training 
the mice explored the open field for min the presence one familiar A and one novel B object Behavior mice was recorded with video camera during the
training and the test and then two persons independently measured exploratory time and the averaged time was
used All objects presented similar textures colors and
sizes but distinctive shapes A recognition index calculated for each mouse was expressed the ratio TB TA TB

RESULTS
A induced behavioral abnormality
In the initial experiment intracerebroventricular injection A was performed using isolated weekold mice When behavior and locomotor activity mice
were examined the open field test line crossing rearing behavior and grooming behavior were almost the
same between the control and A injected mice both 
and weeks after intracerebroventricular injection data
not shown In the resident intruder test the rate mice
that exhibited aggressive behavior the total mice was
 weeks after the injection and weeks
after the injection 
Because A injection into young mice did not seem 
facilitate aggressive behavior used isolated weekold mice The mean body weight was vehicle injected mice control and A injected

Brureau report that serum corticosterone

persistent increase corticosterone level modifies hippocampal excitability glutamatergic neuron activity 
the hippocampus enhanced zinc deficient animals 
which serum corticosterone levels are persistently elevated Takeda and Tamano When excitability hippocampal neurons was checked using brain slices KClinduced exocytosis presynaptic activity was enhanced
 brain slices prepared from A injected mice It likely
that glutamatergic neuron activity the hippocampus 
enhanced via high levels corticosterone after A injection into the mouse brain A mediated increase corticosterone might involved BPSD like symptoms and
cognitive decline A injected mice 
In conclusion the present study suggests that social
isolation housing A injected adult mice irreversibly
induces BPSD like behavioral abnormality It likely
that the behavioral abnormality A injected adult mice
 associated with excitability hippocampal glutamatergic neurons which associated with enhanced activity 
the HPA axis It estimated that intracerebroventricularly injected A transported into the hippocampus which
 involved the negative feedback mechanism glucocorticoid secretion and affects hippocampal function To
understand A pathophysiology individual housing 
 necessary examine how the high dose pmol A 
mouse used the present study changes glucocorticoid
secretion
