Abstract Patients with Parkinsons disease PD may have
hippocampal atrophy compared with controls We compared
hippocampal and extra hippocampal volumes between PD 
PDD patients with PD who have mild cognitive impairment 
dementia Alzheimers disease AD and controls using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging MRI Participants 
patients with PD with PDD with AD and control
subjects had informant interview neurological examination and psychometric testing Established reliable methods
were used measure the hippocampus parahippocampal gyrus temporal frontal and parieto occipital lobes Correction
for intracranial volume was carried out before comparison 
There was age difference between groups mean age 
years On the Clinical Dementia Rating scale CDR cognitive
impairment was mild CDR the majority PDD and
AD patients Hippocampal P volumes were smaller
 the patient groups Effect sizes compared with the control
group were PD PDD and AD The other
volumes did not differ signicantly Among PD and PDD
patients recognition memory P and
Mini Mental State Examination scores P 
correlated with left but not right hippocampal volume In
conclusion hippocampal volume showed pattern Control 
PD PDD AD suggesting progressive hippocampal volume loss PD Volumetric MRI imaging might provide 
early marker for dementia PD Movement Disorder

Patients with Parkinsons disease PD the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder are high
risk for the development dementia Incidence rates for
dementia range from per year The prevalence dementia PD ranges from Thus 
PD with dementia may represent the second most common cause dementia after Alzheimers disease AD 
Dementia PD associated with high risk nursing
home and death Early intervention PD
patients who are risk for dementia would ideal but
accurate diagnosis and prediction necessary 
Prediction dementia imperfect Incidence studies
have identied risk factors which include older age 
male gender longer duration symptoms specic aspects cognitive dysfunction decreased verbal
uency and axial motor impairment which responds
poorly dopaminergic treatment A structural functional neuroimaging marker might complement other
clinical and neuropsychological predictors 
Two previous studies demonstrated that hippocampal atrophy evident PD with without dementia Similar ndings are observed dementia with
Lewy bodies DLB where diffuse Lewy bodies and 
 many cases the pathologic features AD cooccur These changes overlap with those seen 
PD with dementia PDD but DLB distinguished overlapping onset dementia and parkinsonism within months along with hallucinations
and uctuations Except for uctuations none the
core features are distinctive for DLB Visual hallucinations for example are common PD especially

We sought conrm that hippocampal atrophy was
evident independent sample patients with PD
with very mild cognitive impairment dementia compared with healthy elderly and non demented PD using
whole brain volumetric imaging Specically examined hippocampal and extrahippocampal regions discern the pattern atrophy differed between PD and
AD Based previous work hypothesized that hippocampal atrophy would present early stage 
older patients with PD but would lesser severity
than that seen AD Furthermore predicted that the
pattern atrophy would differ between PDD and AD 
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Subjects
Subjects were recruited from the Parkinson Center 
Oregon Movement Disorders Clinic the Oregon Aging
and Alzheimer Disease Clinic and the Oregon Brain
Aging Study Parkinsons disease was dened the
presence two signs among resting tremor rigidity and
bradykinesia consistent with the UK Brain Bank criteria Parkinsons disease with dementia patients required diagnosis PD have preceded the diagnosis
 dementia cognitive impairment least one year 
This information was collected history obtained from
 informant and was used operationally exclude
DLB cases where dementia and parkinsonism occurred
within one year 
Dementia was dened according DSM IV criteria 
Cognitive impairment was staged using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale CDR which has been used previously staging dementia PD A rating termed
questionable very mild dementia indicates persistent
memory impairment mild cognitive functional
change representing change from previous level 
function and was the minimal criterion for cognitive impairment Some patients this stage may not meet strict
criteria for dementia that functional decline was not
required for the present study Nevertheless all cognitively
impaired and demented PD patients were referred 
PDD Higher stages the CDR represent more severe
dementia mild dementia moderate dementia severe dementia Those with AD met criteria for probable AD
according the NINCDS ADRDA 
Methods used for the Oregon Brain Aging Study 
longitudinal study healthy aging have been described
previously All patients and controls underwent interview with informant that was used provide
information diagnose dementia and obtain CDR
staging Cognitive testing was used supportive evidence for cognitive impairment All non demented PD
patients and controls had persistent cognitive functional complaints cognitive problems reported the
patient the informant 
BehavioralCognitive Assessment
Twenty PD patients had cognitive and motor assessments Three additional PD patients were recruited and
assessed but the scans could not analyzed for technical reasons Their data was not included this report 
Baseline cognitive abilities were characterized the
Wide Range Achievement TestReading version 
 The Mini Mental State Examination
 MMSE was carried out with all subjects Depression
was assessed the PD patients and controls using the
Geriatric Depression Scale GDS Behavioral problems were documented using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory NPI Cognitive assessments carried out for
the PD patients included the CERAD word list recall and
recognition test 
Controls and patients with AD were assessed described previously and were age gender and dementia
severity CDR matched the PD subject from pool 
available MRI scans Cognitive tests reported represent
those administered subjects all groups 
Motor Assessment
Standard clinical assessments were used rate
tremor bradykinesia rigidity gait and balance The
Unied Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale UPDRS was
used rate PD patients who entered the study This was
only available for the PD patients None the control
subjects and AD patients exhibited parkinsonism
clinically 
MR Imaging
MRI scans were obtained Tesla GE scanner 
with the following image parameters multi echo multiplanar coronal slices FOV 
matrix NEX TR msec TE and 
msec described previously Image analysis was carried out semiautomated recursive segmentation using
the program REGION and manual tracing using NIH
Image Macintosh computers Total pixel counts
for each region were summed for each slice and multiplied the slice thickness convert areas volumes 
Hippocampal and parahippocampal volumes were measured manually tracing the hippocampal areas 
serial slices located between the red nucleus and the
superior colliculus described previously Intracranial
 suparatentorial volume was dened non bone pixels

DISCUSSION
Our data conrm that PD patients with without
cognitive impairment have more hippocampal atrophy
than healthy age matched control subjects with volumes
similar that patients with mild AD Differences 
parahippocampal volumes were borderline signicance and trends observed were related dementia
severity Differences temporal and frontal lobe volume
and parieto occipital lobes were not signicant this
sample Thus hippocampal atrophy evident older
PD patients before the onset dementia Effect sizes
observed were modest for all comparisons with trend

for hippocampal atrophy AD PDD PD compared
with controls 
We have extended previous research examining 
mild spectrum disease using quantitative whole brain
neuroimaging Previous pathological and imagingbased volumetric that have examined more
advanced patients with PD are consistent with our study 
Hippocampal atrophy also occurs DLB which overlaps pathologically with PDD where hippocampal volume intermediate between that observed controls
and those with AD with sparing the parahippocampal gyrus 
Our study was limited small sample size and 
the fact that the non demented PD group was predominantly male Nevertheless the difference gender distribution between groups was not signicant statistically
and the other patient groups including the PDD group 
were well matched A larger intracranial volume men
would bias against our nding decreased hippocampal volume PD compared with controls arguing that
this nding valid A greater number men the
cognitively intact PD group would bias toward nding
larger volumes that group however have adjusted
for intracranial capacity using accepted methods and the
overall MANOVA remained signicant after excluding
that group Although had small sample size our
current subjects were independent those reported 
our pilot study that showed similar ndings and therefore are conrmatory Based our pilot study 
included number PD patients similar those 
Laakso and associates 
In DLB the rate brain atrophy does not differ from
that AD vascular dementia In comparison with
controls and patients with progressive supranuclear
palsy patients with PD average years younger than
those our study did not show hippocampal atrophy 
raising the possibility that atrophy accelerated PD 
A recent study demonstrated that cognitive decline was
PD AND HIPPOCAMPAL ATROPHY
correlated with global brain atrophy PD A previous
volumetric study patients with PD suggested that
hippocampal atrophy might correlated with episodic
memory consistent with our nding relationship
between cognitive function and left hippocampal volume Given the high risk dementia people with
PD and the nding that atrophy precedes the onset 
dementia our study raises the possibility that focal atrophy might provide presymptomatic marker for dementia risk Nevertheless given that atrophy both cognitively impaired and unimpaired subjects was similar 
additional changes must invoked explain dementia
 PD 
One interpretation the trend larger parahippocampal volumes PDD that the PDD subjects were
 milder stage disease Given that after adjustment
for MMSE there was clearly signicant difference 
parahippocampal volumes between the AD and PDD
groups likely that dementia severity accounts for
this nding On the other hand the PDD and AD groups
did not differ the distribution CDR levels the
MMSE both which reect global cognitive function 
Although sparing parahippocampal and temporal lobe
structures also has been noted DLB compared with
AD imaging studies recent pathological study
found that parahippocampal involvement with Lewy
body and neuritic pathology was associated with dementia patients with PD and DLB consistent with involvement these regions PDD Involvement the
subiculum was shown recently for DLB but not PD 
suggesting that the pattern atrophy might differ 
these two entities 
Our data examining cortical regions including parieto occipital lobe volumes are consistent with recent
study that showed specic sparing occipital volume 
DLB compared with AD and controls In our study 
 many the previous imaging studies there was
considerable overlap between patient groups with respect
 each the brain volumes examined see Fig 
Given our small sample size did not carry out subgroup analyses examine the possibility clinical
heterogeneity 
In summary have shown that hippocampal atrophy
may distinguish PD from healthy controls Hippocampal
changes resemble those seen patients with mild AD
and may correlate with cognitive function Prospective
studies will determine this provides presymptomatic
marker for dementia PD and the evolution atrophy PD resembles that seen other neurodegenerative disorders Ongoing research using higher resolution
MRI scans will allow further more precise denition 
the pattern brain atrophy especially the medial
temporal lobes Pathological correlation with atrophy 
MRI will required determine PDD distinct
from DLB
