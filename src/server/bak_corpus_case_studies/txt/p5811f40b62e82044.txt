ABSTRACT
Background The nosologic relationship between dementia with Lewy bodies DLB and Parkinson
disease with dementia PDD continuously being debated We conducted study using voxelbased morphometry VBM explore the pattern cortical atrophy DLB and PDD 
Methods Seventy four patients and healthy elderly were imaged healthy elderly PDD 
 DLB and Alzheimer dementia AD Three dimensional weighted MRI were
acquired and images analyzed using VBM The following diagnostic criteria were used criteria
proposed the third report the DLB Consortium for DLB the National Institute Neurological
and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimers Disease and Related Diseases
Association criteria for AD and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Mental Disorders fourth
edition criteria for dementia PDD 
Results Overall dementia severity was similar the dementia groups We found more pronounced
cortical atrophy DLB than PDD the temporal parietal and occipital lobes Patients with AD
had reduced gray matter concentrations the temporal lobes bilaterally including the amygdala 
compared PDD Compared DLB the AD group had temporal and frontal lobe atrophy 
Conclusion We found that despite similar severity dementia patients with dementia with
Lewy bodies DLB had more cortical atrophy than patients with Parkinson disease with dementia
 PDD indicating different brain substrates underlying dementia the two syndromes Together
with previous studies reporting subtle clinical and neurobiologic differences between DLB and
PDD our findings support the hypothesis that PDD and DLB are not identical entities but rather
represent two subtypes spectrum Lewy body disease Neurology 
The most common Lewy body diseases are dementia with Lewy bodies DLB and Parkinson disease with dementia PDD which are distinguished differential sequence
 parkinsonism and dementia Although clinical and neurobiologic changes are similar
 DLB and PDD subtle differences have been reported More executive 
and more frequent psychoses have been found DLB than PDD well differences
 the pattern and severity parkinsonism and levodopa responsitivity 
Morphologic studies have indicated that Alzheimer type and Lewy body pathology 
more pronounced DLB than PDD 
In contrast the only study comparing structural MRI PDD and DLB using voxel
based morphometry VBM DLB and PDD differed from Alzheimer dementia AD but
there were differences between DLB and PDD 
We conducted study using VBM further explore the pattern atrophy DLB and
PDD Patients with PDD and DLB well patients with AD and healthy elderly were
imaged and compared test the following hypotheses there are significant differences between DLB and PDD regarding gray matter atrophy the regional pattern 
atrophy DLB and PDD differs from that AD Specifically gray matter atrophy 
more marked AD than DLB PDD

METHODS Case finding and diagnostic procedures Patients were consecutive referrals the Departments Neurology Geriatric Medicine and Geriatric
Psychiatry Stavanger University Hospital Norway In addition some the patients with PD were participants 
prospective epidemiologic study patients with PD Rogaland Norway and were recruited their annual follow
 visit 
Diagnosis PD and dementia A diagnosis PD was
made according explicit criteria A minimum requirement for diagnosis PD was two more the four
cardinal signs for PD resting tremor bradykinesia rigidity and postural instability and the response dopaminergic agent should least moderate 
Diagnosis PDD was made patient fulfilling PD
criteria who also fulfilled criteria for dementia based the
Diagnostic and Statistical Manual Mental Disorders
 DSM IV criteria for and cognitive assessment 
Patients were examined psychiatrist and research
nurse both with special training neuropsychiatry A clinical medical examination was also performed Cognitive tests
and caregiver based rating scales see below were administered research nurse Patients with notable cognitive
impairment before within year after onset PD were
not included the PDD group 
Diagnosis AD and DLB AD was diagnosed according the National Institute Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the AD and Related
Diseases Association NINCDSADRDA criteria for diagnosis probable AD and probable DLB was diagnosed
according the criteria suggested the third report the
DLB Consortium Dementia diagnoses were made after 
clinical interview with the patient and caregiver and supported neuropsychological testing Eleven patients with
DLB underwent iodine I radiolabeled beta iodophenyl N fluoropropyl 
nortropane FP CIT SPECT In cases the diagnosis was
supported pathologic scan Of note all patients this
geographic area who are referred dementia specialist for
evaluation are referred one these three clinics The
records all patients included were evaluated experienced old age psychiatrist D A for verification the
diagnosis before inclusion the VBM analysis 
Exclusion criteria We excluded patients with any neurologic psychiatric disorder other than PD AD DLB that
could etiologically related dementia We checked the
standard sequences the MRI scans before inclusion 
patient control person Those who had structural abnormalities the brain affecting gray matter were excluded
from VBM analysis Subjects with marked tremor which interfered with the imaging session were also excluded One
patient fulfilling the criteria for probable DLB but with 
normal FP CIT SPECT was excluded 
Clinical assessment For motor symptoms staging PD
and DLB was carried out according the Hoehn Yahr
scale 
For cognition all patients performed Mini Mental
State Examination MMSE brief cognitive screening
test In addition patients completed the Dementia Rating
 the CAMCOG the cognitive battery the
CAMDEX 
Neurology 
August 
For psychiatric symptoms the purpose the psychiatric
assessment was twofold first elicit information for the
diagnosis DLB visual hallucinations and second 
differentiate between depression induced cognitive impairment and dementia Psychiatric symptoms were assessed using The Neuropsychiatric Inventory NPI structured
caregiver based clinical interview designed elicit psychiatric symptoms subjects with brain damage and cognitive
impairment Depression was assessed psychiatrist 
research nurse using either the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale MADRS NPI 
Control group Healthy elderly control persons were recruited among elderly people from local clubs for retired
people from relatives patients with PD dementia and
other volunteers after information about the project The
controls had active neurologic psychiatric disorder 
They had cognitive complaints and were not taking any
medication that could affect their cognition A minimum
MMSE score was required Informed consent was obtained from all patients and control subjects and the study
has the approval the Regional Committee for Medical Research Ethics University Bergen 
MRI Patients and controls were scanned the Department
 Radiology Stavanger University Hospital the period
from December June with T Phillips Gyroscan NT intra Release MRI machine A software upgrade the machine was done fall Release 
This has not affected the quality the images which has
been stable throughout the study We performed structural
MRI series with weighted three dimensional fast
spoiled gradient recalled echo FSPGR repetition time TR

VBM preprocessing including the optimized
VBM protocol Good was applied for the preprocessing the images including creating study specific 
template image based all the patients and controls our
study and study specific gray matter template prior probability map The preprocessing steps are already described 
detail others The first preprocessing steps include the
creation customized templates images each patient
were normalized the template using affine
only cut off After normalizing images were averaged and
then smoothed with kernel creating the template We then normalized the original images the customized template using cut off The normalized
images were then segmented and smoothed with 
kernel The smoothed gray matter images were then averaged creating the study specific gray matter template These
templates were used the optimized VBM protocol the
following manner the original images were segmented and
the gray matter images were normalized the customized
gray matter template The resulting deformations from the
normalization gray matter the gray matter template
were used normalize the original images before the
final segmentation Segmented images were then smoothed

Twelve patients were recruited for the study but
were excluded from the VBM analysis for various
reasons Three patients became agitated during
scanning three withdrew from the study after being
scheduled for MRI two were excluded because 
movement artifacts due tremor three had structural lesions affecting gray matter and one patient
was unable scanned the correct head position One control was excluded because claustrophobia Average time between clinical testing and
MRI scanning was days

PDD new and contrasts with the only previous
VBM study MRI PDD and DLB There are
several possible explanations for this difference 
Most importantly patients with PDD the previous had shorter duration disease than
those our study An association between more
severe morphologic changes and shorter duration
between onset PD and dementia has recently
been reported Thus our patients with PDD may
have less severe morphologic cortical changes 
which may explain less pronounced cortical atrophy compared subjects with DLB In addition either VH FC was required for diagnosis
 PDD the previous study Thus patients with
PDD with clinical phenotype similar DLB
were selected that study which probably increases the likelihood similar brain changes 
More cortical atrophy DLB than PDD 
consistent with several recent clinical and pathologic studies that report differences between the
two dementias Psychotic symptoms are more
common DLB than and more pronounced and 
and dysfunction patients with DLB
compared patients with PDD have been reported Furthermore several studies have reported more morphologic changes DLB
compared PDD both Alzheimer type 
and higher density Lewy bodies although
another study reported differences Finally 
recent evidence suggests different patterns 
Neurology 
August 
amyloid beta peptides the CSF DLB and
PDD Thus although methodologic limitations
preclude firm conclusions emerging clinical and
neurobiologic research indicates different pathophysiologic pathways for DLB and PDD 
The posterior parietal association cortex involved the convergence different sensory information Thus possible clinical implications 
the differences atrophy between PDD and DLB
found our study could related differences
 visual perception In both PDD and DLB hypoperfusion parietal and occipital areas has been
found and results showing impaired visuoconstructional skills DLB compared 
could related differences atrophy Further
studies are needed address this issue 
Patients with AD had more atrophy the medial temporal lobes bilaterally including the
amygdalae compared patients with PDD and
DLB This line with previous although minor differences between the studies exist Patients with DLB had more widespread
atrophy temporal parietal occipital and frontal regions than healthy controls many the
same significant areas previous report although these investigators present volume differences while present differences gray matter
concentrations 
There are methodologic factors that may have
influenced our findings Although the sample size
was larger than many other studies and care was
taken select patients from different sources the
number patients each group small Given
the marked clinical heterogeneity PDD and
DLB our findings may not fully generalized 
the entire population patients with PDD and
DLB 
There were demographic and clinical differences between the groups We attempted adjust
for this the statistical analyses including age
and education covariates where the groups
differed In addition reanalyzed the data after
removing the oldest patients with DLB leaving
the groups with similar age The finding more
cortical atrophy DLB than PDD remained
significant indicating that these are robust findings We chose not include dementia duration
 covariate although this possible confound since there could differences the measurement dementia duration between the PDD
and AD DLB groups due recall bias and masking early cognitive deficit due motor symptoms the PDD group Most importantly the
groups were matched for dementia based the
MMSE No generally accepted method exists for
matching dementia severity when comparing different dementia types but MMSE the most
widely used cognitive screening scale dementia 
Another issue concerns the diagnostic accuracy The diagnosis PD was made according 
international standards but there are overall
accepted clinical criteria for PDD and biomarkers available Thus the diagnosis PDD was
based clinical evaluation only and some patients may have been misdiagnosed However 
proportion the patients with PDD have been
followed for years more the same movement disorder research neurologist and diagnosed
according standardized criteria In autopsy
study our hospital there has been accuracy rate Lewy bodyPD the subset the 
patients who have come autopsy far 
The most recent international consensus criteria for DLB were used Although some studies
have reported low sensitivity the previous consensus criteria for clinical DLB diagnosis report
 the Consortium DLB International Workshop high specificity has generally been reported Fifty five percent patients with DLB
had functional imaging the nigrostriatal dopamine system using FP CIT SPECT performed
which confirmed dopamine transporter loss 
method that has shown high specificity distinguish between DLB and AD providing further
support for the diagnostic accuracy
