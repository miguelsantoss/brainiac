I INTRODUCTION
The idea using chip magnetic field sensors and
magnetic labels for detecting biomolecular recognition such
 the hybridization two complementary strands deoxyribonucleic acid DNA antibodyantigen interaction 
general ligandreceptor binding dates back and
was first published Since then this area has developed rapidly generating considerable interest with recent
contributions from number groups The first device
based this approach the Bead Array Counter BARC
biosensor incorporated giant magnetoresistance
GMR sensor strips and used magnetic labels
Dynabeads and has been applied the detection
 biological warfare agents A similar design based 
 diameter GMR spiral sensors has also been proposed
recently In our group work has been focused the use 
smaller more sensitive spin valve sensors for
the detection single Micromer M 
and larger numbers Nanomag D superparamagnetic particles The same system was then used detect the binding streptavidin functionalized labels

sensor bound biotin As alternative spin valve and
GMR sensors Hall effect based sensors have also been used
recently detect single magnetic labels
Dynabeads 
The immediate advantages the use micrometersized labels include our demonstrated ability detect single
labels and the visual verification label position using visible light microscopy However the potential disadvantages
 using such large label biomolecule size ratio include
conformational alterations the biomolecule and hindrance
 biomolecular interaction In addition the use large labels might prevent other labeled biomolecules from interacting with substrate bound biomolecules the proximity This
can avoided one two ways First use biotinylated
target biomolecules which streptavidin functionalized microspheres are bound after hybridization the case 
DNA Alternatively smaller nanometer sized labels can
 used For these reasons the use smaller magnetic labels
such Nanomag D and sized particles Nanomag D spio has been pursued and will discussed this work A major problem encountered during the
use many nanometer sized magnetic labels their tendency cluster forming larger magnetic bodies indiscernible label numbers

II EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
A Spin valve sensors
Spin valve sensors used have dimensions 
the spin valve stripe and the distance between
leads The spin valves were deposited magnetron
sputtering onto Si wafers and have the structure Ta 
 NiFe CoFe Cu CoFe MnIr

MR ratio due the lead contact resistance total lead plus
sensor average resistance The average sensitivity Oe corresponding mV Oe The
intrinsic sensitivity the spin valve sensors can found
from the ratio between the total resistance and the intrinsic
resistance the sensor Oe 
 Oe The spin valve sensors and leads were passivated with thick sputtered layer for protection
against the various fluids used during experimentation 
B Tapered current lines
In addition detection one our goals was control
the movement and placement magnetically labeled biomolecules To address this matter chip tapered current
line structures were designed and integrated with spin valve
sensors Each sensor had two adjacent Al current lines 
 apart the sensor site with widths tapered from 
 the contact pads sensor sites This provided
 structure with increased current density the desired locations adjacent the sensor sites resulting higher local
magnetic fields capable attracting the labels the sensor
area Using this technique labels could moved and
from the sensor surface and across either few 
 Figs and In this way labels
were focused rapidly sensor sites using currents 
 mA considerably increasing the assay detection
time 
Other workers have also reported the chip manipulation magnetic particles using current line structures either
 conjunction with microfluidics for particle for
concentrating particles particular regions using microcoils
FIG Design including spin valve sensor and adjacent tapered current lines for controlled placement and movement the labels Current
flows through the bottom current line attracting particles the thinner region the line 
 current line matrixes Other current line architectures
have been designed for single particle handling but their
integration with detection system such this remains
unique 
C Chip design
Different chip designs were developed for the detection
 both the controlled placement and detection magnetic
labels In the first stages the work chip
featured six sensors each having two associated
current lines for moving the labels Fig First results 
particle detection were obtained with this chip using single
spin valve sensors A second chip was designed exclusively
for the detection labels Fig This chip was also 
 with pairs sensors each pair having one sensor covered with photoresist PR and the other
sensor exposed sensing area for the purpose
 immobilizing biotin the exposed area over the
sensor The two sensors each pair one used for binding
detection exposed and the other used reference PR covered were apart with common input contact and
two independent output contacts enabling both single and
differential sensor measurements For differential measurements load resistor was connected series
with each sensor the pair maintain constant sense
current through each sensor Approximately chips were
fabricated per Si wafer The wafer was cut with dicing
saw and each chip was then mounted pin side brazed
chip carrier The contacts were made via wire bonding and
were protected with silicon gel Elastosil

III RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
A Detection micron sized magnetic labels
In our initial detection single detection 
 Micromer M microspheres was achieved 
V with corresponding saturation signals mV Linearity between label number and signal was observed 
 labels over the sensor For greater numbers labels
 the signal variation was much reduced the labels
were further from the sensor surface contributing only with
small fringe signals More recently the corresponding saturation signals for other commercially available micron sized
magnetic labels was studied Fig Saturation signals 
 mV for the Micromer M were confirmed while
for Magnabind higher saturation signal mV was
obtained This may due the higher magnetic moment
per label Oe emu compared 
 emu for the Micromer M and the difference 
label size Magnabind labels vary size between 
 and may pack more efficiently over the sensor This may
also explain why the sized labels Sera Mag and
Estapor also gave higher saturation signals However when
examined using light microscopy the Micromer M labels
seem far the most uniform size and shape and can 
clearly quantifiable the single label level For this reason 
Micromer M labels were chosen for further work 
Our present studies include the determination detection signals for smaller magnetic labels shows saturation signals for Nanomag D particles functionalized with streptavidin At high particle concentrations 
 particles the signals were approximately mV 
This may consequence high iron oxide content
 compared with Micromer M labels resulting relatively high magnetic moment per particle
volume The magnetic moment per particle was determined
 emu Oe Table I Comparing label size
with sensor surface area one layer labels may
consist individual labels while the same area can
only accommodate three labels 
The detection smaller labels and 
Nanomag D spio shown Fig comparison with the
saturation signal for Magnabind labels In this instance 
very high label concentrations particles only
give small saturation signals the order V 
respectively This would appear consequence their
small moment per label Table I In order produce total
moment emu equivalent one label

 labels labels can accumulate per layer over the sensor surface In addition the field
contribution from each layer labels decreases with increasing distance from the sensor 
C Detection biomolecular recognition
The detection biomolecular recognition between biotin and streptavidin using Micromer M was
previously demonstrated Since then the detection biomolecular recognition using labels using the same binding protocol was achieved shows the detection signal profile for the addition labels functionalized
with streptavidin biotinylated sensor surface The sensor
was first saturated with labels and then repeatedly washed
with phosphate buffer A residual signal mV was obtained contrast the same experiment performed with 
untreated sensor where the signal was observed return 
the base line immediately upon washing the sensor Fig 
 As yet the detection biotinstreptavidin binding using
smaller labels was not achieved Using the moment per label can calculated that streptavidinfunctionalized labels would not give sufficient residual binding signal with the present setup One layer 
 labels covering the sensor surface gives 
total moment emu with maximum signal 
 V which presently within our experimental sensor
plus electronics noise level 
D Detection limits
A theoretical study was performed the detection limits the system used This took into consideration the sensor characteristics and the experimental setup conditions 
The intrinsic noise the spin valve sensor has two main
components The Johnson thermal noise and the magnetic noise Since the measurements were performed low
frequencies Hz the noise preponderant For 
single domain spin valve sensor within the linear regime 
the transfer curve the minimum detectable H min was
calculated using Eq

 Oe H the Hooges constant the spin valve
linear regime N the number charge carriers the

The value for H min was found the order 
mOe corresponding output change V for 
sense current mA Using simple magnetic model 
where the magnetic label placed the center the 
 spin valve sensor and applying Oe plane
magnetizing field along the easy axis the sensor perpendicular the length the sensor the dipole field was calculated the plane the sensor The distance between the
sensor and the label represented the radius the particle plus the thickness the passivation layer 
 A schematic for this model shown Fig The
space between the label and passivation layer occupied 
the biomolecules used immobilize the label the surface
biotinylated cross linker plus streptavidin and the distance
between the sensor surface and the sensing layer were both
considered negligible The average the field component
along the sensing direction the sensor easy axis direction
was used the determination the overall resistance
change the sensor although the total resistance change 
smaller due current redistribution within the sensor Using the magnetic moments the labels shown Table I the
expected sensor signals were calculated For spin valve
sensor with the characteristics described and with bias current mA the expected signals for one 
Micromod M label Fig and for one 
Nanomag D particle were the order V and 
V respectively It was seen that the output signal largely
influenced the sensitivity the sensor and also its
resistance This may explain the variation found the individual signals recorded for single labels 
V using different spin valve sensors Increased signals
can also result from using thinner passivation layer Using

FIG Component the magnetic field along the sensing direction the
sensor for Micromer M magnetic label calculated the plane 
the sensor An external applied field H applied the sensing direction the
sensor used induce moment the superparamagnetic label 
the same reasoning was found that superparamagnetic
label with moment emu would generate signal the intrinsic noise level the sensor mOe average
field V change Consequently and labels
with moments and emu would not 
detected the single label level Although the theoretical
noise voltage change limit was calculated V the
experimental noise was shown the order 
V This limits the measurable moments the order 
 emu which corresponds the detection single
 label Until now detection single labels
was not yet possible due label clustering This effect may
 overcome some extent via polymer encapsulation 
At present the measured noise level can reduced 
other detection methods such lock techniques are used 
Also the detection limit can improved the sensor 
tailored the magnetic label size 
IV CONCLUSIONS
Magnetic label detection signals and signal noise ratios depend the type sensor used sensor dimensions 
label size and moment experimental conditions and amplification techniques Various sensors have been investigated 
large GMR sensors spin valves 
 and Hall sensors each offering particular advantage The use large GMR sensors
allows for the detection large numbers magnetic labels 
which may advantageous for bioassays based increased number biological interactions DNA screening Spin valves offer increased sensitivity the single label
detection level which may exploitable the detection 
single biomolecular interactions and may lead magnetic
random access memorylike bioassays capable screening
thousands different analytes Finally Hall sensors based
 standard complementary metaloxidesemiconductor
technology offer easy integration with chip electron 
ics In conclusion the type sensor used device may 
tailored toward the chosen biological application 
Most the work date has focused the detection 
micron sized labels which may reflect the sensitivity the
systems used While the initial use micron sized labels
was essential for optical verification label position over
the sensor their use certain bioassays may reduce sensitivity due masking neighboring biomolecules the
large label In the course investigating smaller labels 
have demonstrated the detection nanometer sized labels
between and Present calculations based our
present setup indicate that single labels can detected and are now developing sub micron sized sensors
for the detection even smaller labels Further developments for this promising field are foreseen with applications
ranging from genomic research drug development diagnostics
