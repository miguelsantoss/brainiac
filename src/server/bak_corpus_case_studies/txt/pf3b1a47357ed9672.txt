Summary Eighty three brains obtained autopsy from
 and individuals were examined
for extracellular amyloid deposits and intraneuronal
neurofibrillary changes The distribution pattern and
packing density amyloid deposits turned out 
limited significance for differentiation neuropathological stages Neurofibrillary changes occurred the
form neuritic plaques neurofibritlary tangles and
neuropil threads The distribution neuritic plaques
varied widely not only within architectonic units but also
from one individual another Neurofibrillary tangles
and neuropil threads contrast exhibited characteristic distribution pattern permitting the differentiation
 six stages The first two stages were characterized 
 either mild severe alteration the transentorhinal
layer Pre transentorhinal stages I II The two forms
 limbic stages stages III IV were 
conspicuous affection layer Pre both transentorhinal region and proper entorhinal cortex In addition 
there was mild involvement the first A horn
sector The hallmark the two isocortical stages stages
V V I was the destruction virtually all isocortical
association areas The investigation showed that recognition the six stages required qualitative evaluation 
only few key preparations

End stages A D are easily recognized neuropathological examination Evaluation cases with mild 
moderate affection contrast fraught with difficulties Currently quantitative analyses numerous areas
are required for distinction fully developed A D from
cases with insufficiently dense changes Little
effort has yet been made further differentiate cases
which not meet the conventional diagnostic criteria
 U evaluation large cases with
various degrees involvement the existence characteristic changes the distribution pattern neurofibrillary tangles NFT and neuropil threads NT 
became apparent Tables It tempting assume
that this sequence involvement also reflects still
unknown manner the clinical course AD This study 
however not aimed correlating morphological
changes with clinical symptoms but tries show
differences the pattern N F T and N T rendering
morphological stageing AD related changes possible 
Materials and methods
A total brains obtained autopsy and fixed immersion
into aqueous solution formaldehyde was used for this
study None the brains had macroscopically detectable infarctions Eight brains were from individuals whose clinical protocols
included the diagnosis dementia Table nos 
 however neuropathological examination these brains
did not meet the conventional criteria for diagnosis fully
developed AD Twenty one brains were from demented
old aged individuals nos including four brains from
patients who had suffered from Downs syndrome nos 
 Brains displayed sufficient densities isocortical NF
changes confirm the clinical diagnosis AD 
The brains were cut into hemispheres One hemisphere each
brain was then cut into blocks the frontal plane with the aid 
macrotome Fourty brains marked Table asterisk were
cut into blocks Of the remaining brains only blocks
 frontal anterior central uncus level posterior central CGL
level occipital were used the study The blocks were embedded

Discussion
Insidious onset and continual progress dementia 
state clear consciousness characterize AD 
The speed mental deterioration subject interindividual variation This explains the existence 
marked differences the duration the disease The
clinical course can subdivided into number stages
for better recognition and control the progress the
disease 
Individuals suffering from AD develop pathological
changes the brain Most conspicuous the occurrence
 extracellular amyloid and intraneuronal NF changes 
Accumulation this pathological material commences
before the appearance clinical symptoms preclinical
phase 
Amyloid deposits
Depositions amyloid are among the first changes seen
 the brain Most them not correspond NP 
Size and shape the deposits and their distribution
pattern vary from one individual another Characteristics amyloid deposits therefore are limited
significance for differentiation stages 
The fact that accumulations amyloid are frequently found the cortex non demented individuals 
the absence NF changes cases nos 
 has lead the assumption that depositions 
amyloid precede the development NF changes 
 It therefore important note that quite 
number cases one can also recognize contrasting
pattern with cortical NF changes preceding the deposition amyloid Table nos 
 The existence amyloid deposits
can thus not considered prerequisite for the
development NF changes It remains 
elucidated whether there relationship all between
amyloid and NF changes 
Neurofibrillary changes
Intraneuronal NF changes can observed NP NFT
and NT The distribution pattern NP different from
that NFTand NT In general the occurrence NFT
and NT precedes that NR NP frequently show 
patchy distribution with varying densities even within
the boundaries architectonic units 
Moreover their distribution pattern subject considerable inter individual variation The inconsistent presence density and distribution pattern NR therefore 
prevents neuropathological stageing 
NFT and NT contrast exhibit well defined
pattern permitting differentiation 
stages They ultimately lead the destruction many
 the affected nerve cells which documented the
appearance ghost tangles many cortical areas and
subortical nuclei Considerable loss nerve cells
confined circumscribed areas gray matter will
almost certainly cause functional deficits contributing 
the clinical symptoms AD 
Given the existence preclinical phase AD one
would expect find small amount NF changes 
number non demented individuals while demented
patients should show comparable changes higher
density The material examined can fact arranged
 such manner form row with gradually
increasing density NFT and NT Tables 
For practical purposes one should initially classify 
case belonging either the transentorhinal the
limbic the isocortical stages and thereafter 
decide whether mild severe version the
respective stages 
The transentorhinal stages most probably represent
clinically silent periods the disease preclinical phase 
Table They can easily overlooked when using the
conventional hippocampus preparation cut out the
level the lateral geniculate body This because both
the entorhinal and transentorhinal region are either
missing this level present with only remnants 
their posterior poles Fig The hippocampus preparation therefore does not allow recognition transentorhinal stages It also does not permit diagnosis 
unaffected cortex false diagnosis caused absence 
NF changes both the hippocampus and the temporal
isocortex A prerequisite for detection transentorhinal stages thus additional section cut out the
level the uncus Figs The particular
advantage this entorhinal preparation the clear
demonstration the wedge shaped extremity 
 prosubiculum the wing shaped profile the subiculure the presubiculum parasubiculum entorhinal
region transentorhinal region and adjoining temporal
isocortex Figs 
It appears possible that the limbic stages correspond
 clinically incipient AD Table The limbic stages
are characterized the entorhinal region being severely
affected with moderate involvement the first
Ammons horn sector The initially affected the
wedge shaped extremity superimposing the subiculure and extends from hereon towards Involve 
showing nuclei the thalamus hypothalamus and
lower brain stem also reveal sequence involvement
 Fig Table which appears trifle less
consistent when compared the changes seen the
cerebral cortex 
After application the conventional diagnostic
criteria only the most severe cases A D
can set off from broad spectrum cases with
different degrees dementia It appears unsatisfying 
classify the latter non AD cases In fact AD 
gradually progressing process which does not allow one
 draw such sharp borderline The distinction ages
appears far more appropriate The present study
shows that stage differentiation can based upon
qualitative evaluation changes the distribution
pattern NFT and NT Tables Recognition the
six stages under consideration requires minimum 
three sections Fig hippocampal entorhinal and
occipital isocortical preparation and does not include
quantitative evaluations Speed and simplicity are the
particular advantages the proposed procedure
