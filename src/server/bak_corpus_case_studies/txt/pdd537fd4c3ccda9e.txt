were projected onto atlas based regions interest using beamforming Subsequently source space time series for both cortical

brain networks were constructed integrating frequency specic magnetoencephalography networks Functional connections
between all pairs regions interests were quantied using phase based coupling metric the phase lag index Several multiplex
hub and heterogeneity metrics were computed capture both overall importance each brain area and heterogeneity the
connectivity patterns across frequency specic layers Different nodal centrality metrics showed consistently that several hub
regions particularly left hippocampus posterior parts the default mode network and occipital regions were vulnerable 
patients with Alzheimers disease compared control subjects Of note these detected vulnerable hubs Alzheimers disease
were absent each individual frequency specic network thus showing the value integrating the networks The connectivity
patterns these vulnerable hub regions the patients were heterogeneously distributed across layers Perturbed cognitive function
and abnormal cerebrospinal uid levels correlated positively with the vulnerability the hub regions patients with
Alzheimers disease Our analysis therefore demonstrates that the magnetoencephalography based multiplex brain networks contain important information that cannot revealed frequency specic brain networks Furthermore this indicates that functional networks obtained different frequency bands not act independent entities Overall our multiplex network study
provides effective framework integrate the frequency specic networks with different frequency patterns and reveal neuropathological mechanism hub disruption Alzheimers disease

Introduction
Alzheimers disease progressive neurodegenerative disorder Clinically Alzheimers disease characterized 
early memory disturbances due neurodegeneration 
the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus which gradually
spreads the temporal and parietal cortices and eventually
entire cortex well disturbances other cognitive
domains van der Flier and Scheltens Querfurth and
LaFerla Ballard Scheltens 
Alzheimers disease dened neuropathologically the
accumulation tau containing extracellular neurobrillary
tangles and intracellular amyloid containing plaques
 Blennow Scholl The pathology
 these tangles and plaques causes cell loss and synaptic
disruptions specic cortical areas which suggests that
Alzheimers disease can described disconnection

Takahashi Dubois These microscopic alterations eventually can lead macroscopic disruptions and between distant brain areas Scheltens
Electrophysiological and neuroimaging studies have revealed large scale disruptions structural and functional

MEG network studies have shown inconsistent results regarding hubs different frequency bands In earlier sensorlevel MEG studies found that cortical hubs over the left
temporal region are disrupted the theta band patients
with Alzheimers disease compared healthy control subjects Haan whereas patients with
Alzheimers disease showed higher functional connectivity
over centro parietal regions the theta band and over
occipito parietal regions the beta and gamma band
 Stam There could several reasons for
these diverging results one them being that the frequency specic functional networks should not analysed
 isolation therefore requiring unifying framework that
integrates the frequency specic networks and allows for
the investigation the topology across the different frequency bands 
Taking advantage recent developments the eld 
multiplex network theory Kurant and Thiran 
Buldyrev Kivela Boccaletti
 the relationships between frequency specic
networks MEG can investigated Brookes 
 Tewarie In most real world complex
systems set elementary entities interact with each other
 multiple types relationships For instance social
network the network nodes which are individuals create
friendships network links because they are teammates 
colleagues because they are living together student
house Therefore this social network can considered 
 multilayer network where each type relationship
 teammate colleague housemate between individuals
consists each network layer The efciency information transfer between the individuals depends the overall
structure the multilayer network not just the structure 
each specic layer Information about game might for
example spread faster through the team because some
team members also talk about dinner work 
and not only during training session Therefore improve our understanding complex systems consisting 
multiple subsystems and layers connectivity important take the multilayer features into consideration In 
multilayer network each layer consists intraconnected
sets nodes and nodes different layers are interconnected interlayer links A multiplex network the simplest case multilayer network which each layer
shares the same set nodes and the layers are interconnected only the links between the same set nodes
across layers Boccaletti Multiplex network
theory has been applied different real world multiplex
networks such air transportation systems Cardillo
 social systems Battiston interconnected hyperlink networks De Domenico 
and massive multiplayer online games Szell 
The topological properties such systems are generally not
present single layer subnetworks but emerge due the
BRAIN Page 
multilayer character the systems Cardillo 
Battiston Moreover network percolation studies have demonstrated that the structural and dynamical
properties multiplex networks are radically different
from those single layer networks Havlin 
For instance has been demonstrated that single layer
scale free networks are more robust under random attacks
than targeted attacks important hubs Albert 
 However the case interdependent networks 
hub nodes are particularly vulnerable when random cascading failure occurs Buldyrev Moreover 
even when the hubs are protected the multiplex scale free
networks are still vulnerable random attacks Huang
 Previous frequency specic brain network studies have shown that hub regions Alzheimers disease are
more vulnerable under targeted attack than random attack
 Stam Crossley but unknown
whether hub regions are also disrupted multiplex networks Alzheimers disease Therefore important 
study the hub properties Alzheimers disease the
framework multiplex networks In our study the frequency specic MEG based networks can naturally
modelled multiplex networks where each frequency specic network corresponds layer and layers are interconnected the links between the same set brain
regions across layers

weighted clustering coefcient overlapping weighted local efciency overlapping weighted betweenness centrality were
rst computed for each node each layer separately and
then summed across frequency specic delta theta 
alpha alpha and beta layers The multiplex centrality
metrics were computed for each node AAL region for
each epoch and for each subject The link weights different
layers may have different magnitudes which may cause biases
for the estimation multiplex centrality metrics and for the
comparison between multiplex networks Stam 
To minimize the potential biases caused the different magnitudes link weights the link weights within each layer were
rst ranked increasing order and then assigned natural

were computed based the ranked link weights 
Hub disruption multiplex networks
To compare the nodal centrality hub properties between the
Alzheimers disease and healthy control groups computed
the hub disruption index Achard For given
nodal centrality measure for instance the overlapping
weighted degree rst computed the mean overlapping
weighted degree averaged over epochs and subjects 
multiplex networks the healthy control group Next 
subtracted the mean overlapping weighted degree the
healthy group ohcontroli from the overlapping weighted degree
 the corresponding node one epoch for one patient with
Alzheimers disease diseasei which was then plotted
against ohcontroli This was repeated for each node The hub
disruption index for the epoch the patient with
Alzheimers disease the linear regression coefcient leastsquares rst order polynomial the regression line tted
 the resulting scatter plot Supplementary Fig The same
procedure was also performed for each epoch each subject
 the healthy control group The hub disruption index was
therefore estimated for all the epochs the subjects both
groups The signicance between group difference the
hub disruption index was estimated using permutation testing
 for details see the Statistical analysis section We assumed
that the nodal centrality for healthy subject similar the
average the healthy controls and that Alzheimers disease
the largest hubs are most disrupted In this case the
regression line for the controls would horizontal 
whereas the regression line for the patients with Alzheimers
disease would have negative slope Supplementary Fig 
In this study the values the multiplex centrality metrics
and corresponding hub disruption indices were used quantify the vulnerability hub regions patients with

Heterogeneity multiplex networks
For multiplex network two nodes and may have for
example exactly the same overlapping weighted degree
 yet have different weighted degree distributions
across different layers and therefore play different roles 
the multiplex network To characterize the heterogeneity 
the connectivity patterns the layer MEG multiplex networks rst performed conventional statistical analyses
 Fig such the computation the mean and standard
deviations the weighted degrees for each region across 
frequency specic layers and the pair wise correlations the

 Supplementary Table These results demonstrate that
multiplex brain networks Alzheimers disease were not
only disrupted selectively specic brain areas but also 
As can seen Fig A the weighted degrees were highest the alpha band single layer network but lowest 
the beta band single layer network both Alzheimers disease and control groups For the majority brain regions 
the standard deviations the weighted degrees across the
 layers were lower for patients with Alzheimers disease
than for the controls indicating that for most brain regions
the weighted degrees were less heterogeneously distributed
across the frequency bands patients with Alzheimers
disease than control subjects Fig B In Fig C 
ranked the weighted degrees within each frequency specic
network for the two groups respectively By visual inspection both groups the weighted degree sequences
appeared weakly anti correlated with the regions which
are hubs one layer often having low weighted degree
 other layers To quantify the correlations the weighted
degree sequences computed the Spearmans rank correlations between pairs layers both groups Fig D 
We found that both groups the weighted degrees sequences pairs layers were only weakly correlated 
patients with Alzheimers disease the delta and alpha 
layers were anti correlated controls the theta and
alpha layers were correlated which was even weaker 
patients with Alzheimers disease the alpha and alpha 
layers were anti correlated controls but were correlated
 patients with Alzheimers disease These results suggest
the existence nodal heterogeneity weighted degree distributions across layers MEG based multiplex networks 
indicating that brain regions play different roles different
frequency specic networks 
To quantify and compare the heterogeneity the multiplex brain networks Alzheimers disease patients and
control subjects further considered the overlapping
weighted degree and multiplex participation coefcient 
the same time mapping the D Pi plane for both
groups Fig A In patients with Alzheimers disease the
Pi was negatively correlated with Spearmans
 P indicating that the weighted degrees hub regions patients with Alzheimers disease
are less homogeneously distributed across layers than those
 non hub regions In contrast for the control subjects the
weighted degree distributions the hub regions were more
homogeneously distributed across layers than those nonhub regions Spearmans P These
correlation coefcients differed P indicating
that the hub regions the multiplex brain networks 
patients with Alzheimers disease were less heterogeneously
distributed across layers than those controls

Discussion
We analysed MEG based resting state multiplex networks
 patients with Alzheimers disease and controls No evident differences between the two groups were found when
comparing the topologies frequency specic networks individually In contrast comparison with controls multiplex networks patients with Alzheimers disease were
characterized loss nodal centrality hub regions
such the left hippocampus posterior default model network and occipital regions well different nodal heterogeneity these vulnerable regions across layers In
patients with Alzheimers disease the damage highly
central hub areas correlated positively more abnormal

Our multiplex network analysis the rst MEG sourcespace network study reporting the selectively vulnerable
hubs involving the hippocampus posterior DMN and occipital regions patients with Alzheimers disease Except
for the occipital regions the vulnerability the hippocampus and posterior DMN patients with Alzheimers
disease has consistently been reported previous structural
 DTI and MRI and functional PET and functional MRI 
neuroimaging studies Greicius Supekar 
 Buckner Lo Crossley 
 However these specic disrupted hub regions have
not been found previous frequency specic MEG studies
 Stam Haan Canuet 
 In addition the multiplex centrality metrics were
able identify the prominent hubs located the posterior
midline precuneus and hippocampus the controls 
which were usually absent frequency specic electrophysiological studies Brookes Hipp 
 Baker Therefore integrating frequency specic MEG functional networks into framework multiplex networks provides more information 
support the theoretical prediction that hub regions are
particularly vulnerable Alzheimers disease than only
considering individual frequency specic networks 
Hubs multiplex networks are
selectively vulnerable Alzheimers
disease
In the present study found that MEG based restingstate multiplex networks Alzheimers disease were preferentially disrupted hub regions including regions

are disrupted patients with Alzheimers disease Engels
 Yu Our previous sensor space
MEG network study found that the theta band nodal centrality over the left temporal lobe was disrupted Haan
 In addition functional MRI network studies
have also identied selectively vulnerable hub regions 
Alzheimers disease involving the DMN Buckner 
 Dai and hippocampus Supekar 
 Recently functional MRI study found that the
cascading network failure patients with Alzheimers disease begins the posterior DMN without evidence 
amyloid plaques PET and then progresses other
hub regions Jones which highlights the important role posterior components DMN 
Alzheimers disease Stam Performing meta analysis MRI studies Crossley and colleagues reported that patients with Alzheimers disease the hubs
 medial temporal and parietal regions had more MRI
lesions than non hub regions further supporting our ndings Furthermore our MEG study one the rst network studies report the disruption specic occipital
hub regions patients with Alzheimers disease 
Computational network models have also demonstrated
that high cost hub regions tend more vulnerable 
Alzheimers disease Stam Haan 
 Raj An extensive simulation study
showed that abnormal network organization patients
with Alzheimers disease including decreased functional
connectivity selectively disrupted hub regions and morerandom network topologies could explained activity dependent degeneration Haan 
Specically the assumption that excessive local neuronal
activity causes synaptic damage provides possible explanation for these network changes including the hub
vulnerability patients with Alzheimers disease 
Our MEG based multiplex study conrmed the hub vulnerability patients with Alzheimers disease However 
aforementioned modelling studies are within the framework single layer networks As mentioned the
Introduction section hub nodes multilayer networks
become particularly vulnerable when random cascading
failures occurs Buldyrev even when
hubs are protected Huang Therefore there
 strong need for establishing multiplex network models

The vulnerable brain regions 
Alzheimers disease played different
roles across layers
The nodal centrality metrics evaluated the importance 
each node for the overall efciency the multiplex networks By computing the multiplex participation coefcient were able quantify the participation each
node the topology each layer 
We reported that patients with Alzheimers disease the
vulnerable hub regions detected the nodal centrality
metrics had different nodal heterogeneity across layers 
comparison with controls Figs B and C Among these
vulnerable regions the posterior DMN regions shifted from
peripheral hubs controls connector non hubs patients with Alzheimers disease indicating that the posterior
DMN regions played different functional roles across layers
 the two groups In this study each layer corresponded 
each frequency specic MEG network The heterogeneous
connectivity patterns posterior DMN regions across different layers controls were disrupted patients with
Alzheimers disease indicating that posterior DMN regions
 patients with Alzheimers disease were not equally disrupted across layers In contrast other vulnerable regions
such left hippocampus superior parietal cortex and occipital regions showed similar nodal heterogeneity the
Alzheimers disease and healthy control groups indicating
that these vulnerable regions were uniformly disrupted 
all frequency specic MEG networks patients with
Alzheimers disease Furthermore the multiplex participation coefcients showed that the left hippocampus and superior parietal cortex were equally participating each
layer the two groups however the three occipital regions had different connectivity patterns different frequency bands both groups In patients with
Alzheimers disease the different connectivity patterns 
the vulnerable hub brain regions across layers indicate
that hubs played different roles different frequency
bands Therefore the essence take all the frequency specic networks into account simultaneously

 Stam Haan Crossley
In this study the observed positive correlations between
the multiplex nodal centrality posterior DMN hippocampus and the MMSE scores patients with Alzheimers
disease indicate that the vulnerability the hub areas
has clinical relevance Fig We reported that several
components the posterior DMN right precuneus and
inferior parietal cortices well the hippocampus 
were vulnerable patients with Alzheimers disease This
 line with previous ndings healthy controls and
patients with Alzheimers disease The DMN known 
play role many different cognitive functions Fox and
Raichle Raichle It has consistently been
demonstrated that the DMN early Alzheimers disease
shows abnormal connectivity pattern which correlates
strongly with abnormal cognitive functioning Greicius

 Therefore the disruption the nodal efciency

the abnormal cognitive performances patients with
Alzheimers disease Lehmann Similarly the

role hippocampus memory processing might explain
why the disruption its hub property could lead the

Relationship between hub

CSF biomarkers CSF tau and tau have
been established biomarkers for Alzheimers disease
 Blennow In particular the level CSF decreased patients with Alzheimers disease

compared with healthy controls while levels CSF

Scheltens Therefore reasonable assume
that there might some relationship between the levels 
CSF biomarkers and the abnormal brain network organization Alzheimers disease In the present study patients
with Alzheimers disease the level CSF was
positively associated with the disruption hub areas the
multiplex brain networks quantied the hub disruption index Fig The negative hub disruption indices 
patients with Alzheimers disease indicated that areas that
were hubs controls were disrupted patients with
Alzheimers disease Fig and that this related lower
levels CSF Fig providing link with
underlying pathophysiology Our study the rst MEG
network study report the positive association between
abnormal levels CSF and hub disruption
 the multiplex brain networks To date only few studies
have explored the impact CSF functional
connectivity patients with Alzheimers disease One MEG
resting state functional connectivity study has reported that
MCI patients with abnormal CSF show
decreased functional connectivity the medial temporal
regions and posterior DMN regions specic frequency
bands Canuet In resting state functional
MRI study decreased CSF was also shown
 associated with reduced functional connectivity between posterior cingulate and medial temporal regions
 Wang Moreover previous PET amyloid
imaging study has demonstrated that deposition patients with Alzheimers disease preferentially
located cortical hub areas Buckner The
low level CSF indicates the increased deposition the brain Therefore our observations
provide possible link between hub vulnerability and
amyloid pathology CSFs and brain regions patients
with Alzheimers disease On the other hand the current
study cannot provide the evidence correlations between
the levels CSF tau and multiplex network measures 
which could due the limited size our patient
sample Future studies could use larger group patients
with Alzheimers disease investigate the potential correlations between the levels CSF tau and multiplex network measures

Previous MEG studies both patients with Alzheimers

 Here integrated frequency band specic MEG networks multiplex network framework 
Our MEG multiplex network study provides powerful
framework not only detect the vulnerable hub areas 
but also reect the heterogeneous connectivity patterns 
the vulnerable hubs patients with Alzheimers disease 
Noticeably these ndings could not revealed frequency specic analysis Fig Thus the multiplex network measures not only enhanced the sensitivity 
differentiation between patients with Alzheimers disease
and controls compared with frequency specic analyses 
but also revealed the interrelationship between functional
networks different frequency bands Alzheimers

Nonetheless not intend doubt ignore the
frequency specic properties MEG networks In fact 
the nodal heterogeneity MEG multiplex networks conrmed the underlying diverse topologies frequency band
specic networks Figs B and C and demonstrated that
frequency specic networks not act independent entities but interact with each other The coordination and
cooperation frequency specic networks are possibly 
reection the observations that different frequencies 
play different roles cognitive and behavioural processes 
but that optimal cognition also requires integration these
different processes Disruption the integrated framework
 multiplex networks such Alzheimers disease can
therefore lead abnormal cognitive and behavioural
symptoms which indeed what observed Fig

Our current study has number strong points multiplex network analysis could largely reduce the potential

potential biases from the differences the magnitudes 
link weights between layers reanalysed our data rst
ranking the link weights within each layer We found
that the key ndings were consistent Supplementary Figs
 and across approaches and performing both
group and subject level permutation tests for the comparisons multiplex measures reduced potential biases
 differences statistical power and sensitivity outliers that either approach may have 
There are also several limitations that should mentioned Our results may have been inuenced methodological choices such the manual selection artefact free
epochs However the selected epochs were checked for
quality and signs drowsiness experienced independent researcher Furthermore the modest sample size
might limitation All patients with Alzheimers disease
included this paper had pathological biomarkers suggestive for Alzheimers disease obtained either CSF 
amyloid PET scanning but the amyloid status the
healthy control groups was unknown Therefore 
cannot exclude that several healthy controls actually had
amyloid pathology and neuronal damage well To
reduce the risk excluded four control subjects with abnormal results cognitive testing Furthermore our
study one the rst exploratory studies regarding the
relationships between MMSE scores and multiplex network
metrics and between CSF biomarkers and the hub disruption indices did not correct for multiple testing the
post hoc correlation analyses Instead reported the
exact P values for the readers interpretation 
In healthy brains the pattern functional networks 
partially determined the underlying structural networks
 Honey Ponten Misic 
 Stam However the essential relationship between structural and functional networks

study found that hub regions hippocampus and posterior DMN were selectively vulnerable patients with
Alzheimers disease which consistent with the ndings
 previous studies using other neuroimaging modalities
 Crossley The multiplex framework allows
for the integration multimodal neuroimaging data 
such functional MEG PET and functional MRI and
structural networks DTI and MRI Sporns In that
case the interaction between the functional and structural
networks can studied under the unied framework 
multiplex network not only for patients with Alzheimers
disease but also for healthy controls and for other brain
disorders Furthermore this study constructed multiplex networks integrating frequency specic MEG

To date there generally accepted optimal approach

different nodes Boccaletti In future studies 
 important develop and apply multilayer network
measures which are appropriate for functional brain studies Moreover Fig shows that the patients with
Alzheimers disease and healthy controls were clearly differentiated the D Pi plane Therefore combining
machine learning approaches such random forest support vector machine with the performed multiplex network
analyses could easily distinguish the two clinical groups 
which interest for future study Zanin 
Conclusion
In the present study used multiplex network framework investigate the interaction between the MEG frequency specic functional networks patients with
Alzheimers disease and healthy control subjects Using
multiplex network metrics functional networks patients
with Alzheimers disease were characterized more heterogeneous compared those healthy controls We
demonstrated that the hub regions particular the
hippocampus posterior DMN regions and occipital areas 
were preferentially affected and that the hub vulnerability
 these regions correlated positively with the cognitive deterioration and the abnormal accumulation levels amyloid plaques cerebrospinal uid which may augment
the underlying neuropathological cascade Alzheimers
