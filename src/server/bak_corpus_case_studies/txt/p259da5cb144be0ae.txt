The hippocampus and adjacent extrahippocampal structures are organized distinct and specialized
regions which process heterogeneous functions including memory and visuospatial functions Specic
alterations the different hippocampal subelds and adjacent extrahippocampal structures could
differently contribute the pathophysiology Alzheimers disease AD and dementia with Lewy
bodies DLB Based visual symptoms which characterize DLB patients the hippocampal subelds and
the adjacent extrahippocampal structures which are mainly involved the visual functions could 
impaired DLB and preserved AD To test this hypothesis performed structural magnetic resonance imaging DLB AD and age matched healthy controls FreeSurfers pipelines were used
 perform parcellation hippocampus and adjacent extrahippocampal structures and assess the
structural changes within each region The cornu ammonis and subiculum were bilaterally damaged 
AD and preserved DLB The perirhinal cortex and parahippocampus were damaged DLB but not 
AD Our ndings demonstrate that the hippocampal subelds and adjacent extrahippocampal structures
were differently altered AD and DLB Particularly DLB patients showed more focused alteration the

Introduction
Alzheimers disease AD and dementia with Lewy bodies DLB 
represent the most common forms neurodegenerative dementia elderly Vann Jones and OBrien Although AD and
DLB are characterized clinical overlap especially the early
stage DLB patients show greater attentional and visuoperceptual
impairment Calderon Collerton and less
prominent memory loss Calderon Ferman 
 compared with AD patients Particularly visual hallucinations 
together with uctuating cognition and extrapyramidal signs 
represent the core clinical feature DLB McKeith 
The hippocampus heterogeneous brain structure consisting
 distinct and specialized regions which process different functions
including information consolidation from the episodic memory

Although the hippocampal atrophy has been consistently
reported AD and DLB Barber Chow 
Firbank Hashimoto Mak 
Sabattoli the adjacent extrahippocampal structures
including entorhinal perirhinal and parahippocampal structures
have been poorly investigated 
In the present study hypothesize that specic alterations 
the hippocampal subelds and adjacent extrahippocampal structures could differently contribute the pathophysiology AD and
DLB Specically based visual symptoms present DLB patients 
 expect that the extrahippocampal structures which are mainly
involved the visual functions could impaired DLB and
preserved AD To verify this hypothesis studied the possible
alterations the hippocampal and extrahippocampal structures 
DLB and AD patients using automated data analysis approaches

Specically the CA DG and subiculum were overall more

that AD and its prodromal stages are associated with neuronal loss
 the and the subiculum regions Corder Kerchner
 Thompson Furthermore was observed
that the alteration hippocampal structures begins anteriorly 
the and subiculum regions and subsequently propagate the
 and subelds Apostolova Devanand 
 Wang These pathological ndings have
been conrmed structural imaging studies reporting bilateral
atrophy and subiculum AD compared healthy

Mueller Sabattoli The DG plays crucial
role associative memory and its damage could linked disturbances memory and learning observed the early stages 
AD Ohm We observed CA and subiculum preservation 
DLB patients Although the alteration DLB debated Chow
 Sabattoli recent studies have reported
 preservation DLB agreement with our ndings Firbank
 Mak Neuropathological studies did not
 signicant differences between controls and DLB the hippocampal formation Harding Furthermore 
compared AD patients DLB patients showed preservation the
cell viability the and subiculum and selective loss lower
presubiculum pyramidal neurons Harding 
As compared controls our study the perirhinal cortex was
reduced DLB but not AD patients Anatomically the perirhinal
cortex located between the ventral medial surface the
temporal lobe surrounding the amygdala and anterior hippocampus and the ventral visual pathway Suzuki and Naya 
Consistently with its prominent interconnections with unimodal
and polymodal cortical association areas the perirhinal cortex
contributes wide range functions including visual functions
 Suzuki and Naya The perirhinal cortex ablation has been
shown impair visual object identication Buckley and Gaffan 
 Furthermore recent studies suggested that the perirhinal
cortex contributes perceptual processing Devlin and Price 
and that necessary for the disambiguation perceptually and
semantically confusable objects Kivisaari 
The parahippocampus was damaged DLB patients but not 
AD patients The parahippocampal gyrus posterior perirhinal
cortex and has been associated with many cognitive processes 
including visuospatial processing Burgess Recent
studies have demonstrated that the parahippocampal cortex 
site for integration and processing contextual associations
 Aminoff and that the direct electrical stimulation the
parahippocampal place area causes topographic visual hallucinations Mgevand 
The perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices are reciprocally
connected Suzuki and Naya Furthermore both regions
show functional and structural connections with dorsal visual and

have recently proposed that complex visual hallucinations could
involve also subcortical regions outside the primary visual areas 
including thalamus amygdala and hippocampus Amad 
 Delli Pizzi Ford Heitz 
 Selimbeyoglu and Parvizi Shine In the
present study did not observe signicant relationship between the frequency and the severity visual hallucinations and
the extrahippocampal atrophy However are aware that the
current assessment limited lacking specic battery for
investigating the visuoperceptual and attentional functions Thus 
further studies combining neuroimaging outcomes and specic
neuropsychometric tests visual functions are request better
clarify the role the extrahippocampal regions the pathophysiology the visual dysfuntion DLB 
As compared controls the entorhinal cortex was affected 
both AD and DLB patients The entorhinal cortex located between
subiculum and perirhinal cortex It plays critical role the
episodic memory particularly the storage and retrieval new
declarative memories Di Paola Sasaki 
Squire Entorhinal atrophy has been linked mild
memory loss and has been described primary site 
dysfunction AD Mueller Whitwell 
deToledo Morrell Less clear the contribution the
entorhinal cortex DLB As compared AD entorhinal
preservation has been found Firbank whereas
comparable atrophy has been found Kenny Interestingly the entorhinal cortex plays central role the visual
recognition memory Meunier Hence the damage 
the entorhinal cortex could linked impaired visual recognition
memory which has been found DLB patients compared 
controls and PD patients Mondon 
Of note observed that extrahippocampal thinning DLB
patients was predominant the right hemisphere This nding 
 accordance with previous studies from our group showing
prominent structural and functional alterations the right hemisphere DLB patients Delli Pizzi 
Franciotti and with the dominant role right hemisphere visuospatial attention Thiebaut Schotten 
In conclusion our ndings demonstrate that the hippocampal
subelds and the extrahippocampal structures are differently
impaired DLB and AD Particularly DLB patients showed 
more focused alteration the structures linked visuoperceptual
and attentional functions We retain that these ndings could 
important starting point conrm the extrahippocampal
involvement the etiology visual dysfunction DLB 
As limitation the study must recognize that the small
sample size across the groups would require the replication the
study larger cohorts from different centers
