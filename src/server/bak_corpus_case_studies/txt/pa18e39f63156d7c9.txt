Summary
 years These assessments were compared with results from
 normal controls During the study three risk subjects
became clinically affected Volumetric measurement the
HF showed that asymmetrical atrophy developed these
subjects before the appearance symptoms Verbal and
visual memory measures declined parallel with
hippocampal loss A loss per annum the
volume the HF occurred the years over which symptoms
first appeared These findings may have implications for
early diagnosis ofAIzlieimers disease

Introduction
The HF invariably involved severe cases Alzheimers
disease much that Alzheimers disease has been called
 hippocampal dementia Hyman Ball 
 The histopathological hallmarks the disease 
neurofibrillary tangles and amyloid plaques are found 
large numbers the hippocampus Macroscopically these
are accompanied gross atrophy the HF and concomitant
enlargement surrounding CSF spaces West 
Post mortem studies elderly mildly affected individuals
have suggested that these pathological changes start the
entorhinal cortex and hippocampus before progressing the
association cortices Braak The hippocampus
 known closely involved memory function Squire 
 These findings accord with the clinical observation
that memory impairment one the earliest manifestations

Seven six male and one female risk members

age onset years the disease within the family
were recruited longitudinal study The family tree 
shown Fig subject numbers refer individuals who
participated the study Details this pedigree have
previously been described Kennedy Thirty 
eight male and female normal control subjects without
 family history dementia were recruited from volunteers
and from the spouses individuals with familial Alzheimers
disease Informed written consent was obtained from all
subjects The study received ethical approval from
participating centres 
Each assessment included clinical examination neuropsychometry and MRI volumetric scan On each visit 
careful history for the presence symptoms was taken from
the subject and from the subjects spouse other close
family member All subjects were assessed with the MMSE

even such mildly affected patients have had symptoms for
some months years Studies patients with clinically
diagnosed Alzheimers disease will inevitably miss any presymptomatic changes 
To test the hypothesis that structural changes the HF
are measurable MRI before the development overt
symptoms conducted prospective study subjects 
risk familial Alzheimers disease Individuals carrying 
mutation the amyloid precursor protein gene develop
familial Alzheimers disease with early and relatively
predictable age onset Rossor This study
recruited subjects who were within years the historical
age onset for that family In this way early symptomatic
 pre symptomatic cerebral changes may detected 
individuals who later become clinically affected Longitudinal
scanning allows small volume changes detected the
initial scan for each subject can used within subject
control Over year period serial MRI based volumetric

assessments seven initially asymptomatic risk

Results
Subjects
The mean SD age the risk subjects years 
years did not differ significantly from the mean SD age
 the control subjects years years At the
initial assessments all seven risk family members were
asymptomatic that neither they nor their families had any
complaints relating their cognitive function At entry into
the study all subjects were working full time All had normal
neurological assessments and all scored 
the MMSE and the CDR 
Clinical
There was significant deterioration either clinically 
the neuropsychology test scores four the subjects Three
subjects and however became clinically
affected during the course the study with concerns
about memory function appearing before their second
assessments Subject became worried about his memory
 years after his first scan and sought medical advice because
 this year later At this stage was still working and
scored the MMSE and the CDR He
continued working full time until months after his third
scan years after recruitment into the study Subject 
became worried about his memory the year following his
first scan and began have difficulties route finding and
coping work during the next year He went sick leave
 months before his second scan At the time his second
scan was still able score the MMSE and had
 CDR By the time his third scan year later 
 was significantly cognitively impaired with CDR 
 Subject started having trouble coping with
work months after the first scan and her husband became
concerned that her memory had deteriorated She retired 
sick leave months later year before the last scan At this
stage her MMSE had fallen with CDR

 Sun Microsystems Inc Mountain View Calif USA where
measurements were performed retrospectively 
randomized and blinded fashion All patient details were
removed from the images and the studies were chosen 
random from larger group including normal controls 
Measurements were made using the MIDAS image analysis
program Freeborough This program allows the
viewing and defining anatomical regions interest the
coronal axial sagittal planes simultaneously The HF was
defined including the dentate gyrus the hippocampus
proper the subiculum and the alveus The fornix and fimbria
were excluded from the measurements Standard neuroanatomical atlases were used define the HF from its tail
 its head typically slices the coronal plane 
 Duvernoy T weighted MRIs permit grey and white
matter structures differentiated and the thin slices
employed give voxel size and
increased accuracy the volume estimates The HF was first
manually outlined the sagittal plane and then edited the
coronal plane The use more than one plane 
measurement while time consuming allows more accurate
determination anatomical boundaries Change 
hippocampal volume measurements for the same individual
may compared directly but order allow comparisons
between individuals who have different total brain volumes
the hippocampal volumes were normalized using the total
intracranial volume measure premorbid brain size 
Total intracranial volumes were measured using the axial weighted scans The external limit the CSF inner border
 the calvarium was outlined using semi automated
interactive grey level thresholding technique The inferior
plane the intracranial volume was arbitrarily taken 
the lowest slice which included cerebellar tissue The volumes
 the HF and the total intracranial volumes defined were
calculated automatically The relationship between the HF
volume and the total intracranial volume was calculated using
 linear regression model P the HF
volumes all the individuals were then normalized for
intracranial volumes according the covariance method
described Jack Intra rater reproducibility
was estimated measuring HFs twice without knowledge

Discussion
This study shows that significant hippocampal atrophy 
familial Alzheimers disease detectable early stage
 the disease and when subjects are apparently
asymptomatic At the time their initial scans all three
subjects who subsequently became clinically affected had
significant asymmetry their hippocampal volumes implying
that atrophy the smaller HF had occurred over some period
before the initial scan In each subject hippocampal atrophy
appeared when the subject was still working full time and
was scoring above the MMSE This years
earlier than these individuals would otherwise have presented
clinically The definition pre symptomatic was that neither
the subject nor their family had any complaints about their
cognitive function The neuropsychological results show that
even when these criteria were fulfilled memory deficits were

The wide variation normal hippocampal size means that
within subject change HF may discriminate cases 
Alzheimers disease from normal controls significantly earlier
than absolute volumes In addition hippocampal asymmetry
may early sign the presence degenerative
process In much the same way the presence selective
memory deficit may very early marker cognitive
deterioration and yet this deficit may not have produced any
noticeable limitation day day functioning WintersMiner Newman This study does
not answer the question when where cerebral changes
 Alzheimers disease are first detectable but does indicate
that the effects the degenerative process both terms

consistency the findings these early onset familial cases

other family members risk familial Alzheimers disease

The combination reliable hippocampal volumetry and
neuropsychometry may have role the early diagnosis 
Alzheimers disease and the measurement early disease

disease progression will increasingly important trials
 therapies intended slow halt the disease process
