Background Parkinsons disease PD characterized by motor dysfunction and cognitive decline may demonstrate specic patterns of brain atrophy Although cross sectional magnetic resonance imaging MRI studies
show correlation between regional brain volume loss and cognitive impairment there is only scarce evidence
from longitudinal studies validating the link between cognition and brain anatomy in PD 
Objective To test the relationship between magnitude and spatial extent of atrophy in PD patients with progressive signicant cognitive decline and dementia PDD 
Methods We followed thirty three initially non demented patients with prevalent PD for three years while monitoring cognitive function and brain atrophy Longitudinally acquired weighted magnetic resonance images
were analyzed in the voxel based morphometry framework of SPM 
Results Groups did not differ signicantly with respect to age or gender More males developed PDD 7 males 3
females compared to those remaining intact 12 males 11 females Clusters of lower grey matter volume were
found in PDD compared to PD in left uncus at baseline and an expanded region that included the left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus at 36 months The cognitive status by scan interaction showed differential
changes between groups in the right insula At a more liberal statistical threshold we observed changes in the
right insula and bilateral hippocampi as well as the right cuneus additional to the lower brain stem 
Conclusions Region specic atrophy consistent with the pattern of cortical Lewy body deposition seen in autopsy
studies can be detected with MRI in PD patients with signicant cognitive decline MRI may be useful for tracking
cognitive decline in PD

Introduction
Parkinsons disease PD is the most common neurodegenerative
movement disorder and is characterized by loss of dopaminergic
nigrostriatal projections however over time more generalized pathology leads to widespread neurodegeneration 1 which leads to signicant loss of motor response to dopamine replacement cognitive
decline and dementia 2 3 4 The latter are the major determinants on
nursing home placement and increased mortality 5 6 The neurologic
bases for these changes are not fully understood Imaging biomarkers
might assist in tracking pathological changes in predication of dementia
and in development of treatments Magnetic resonance imaging may be
one such approach that is readily available 7 8

Patients with PD with dementia PDD have progressive atrophy on
MRI 9 10 that likely begins with mild cognitive impairment which occurs in at least 24 of patients 11 prior to signicant cognitive decline 
Recent studies show that longitudinal cortical grey matter changes
occur in incident early Parkinsons disease cases 12 13 14 15 16 
These ndings are consistent with prior studies that suggest that subtle
changes occur prior to overt cognitive decline 17 18 and can be detected in prevalent cases 19 Grey matter atrophy rates may depend on
duration of disease 20 and can complement other biomarkers of
change 21 
We have shown that whole brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement occur in older patients with PD developing incident dementia or
signicant cognitive decline 22 and might be accelerated in patients
with hyper homocysteinemia 23 In the current study we analyze
this same cohort for regional changes in brain atrophy using state ofthe art optimized voxel based morphometry to test for more focal
changes driving the previously observed whole brain atrophy and ventricular dilations We hypothesized that atrophy is localized in a pattern

consistent with reported pathological Lewy body changes in the anterior cingulate insula and medial temporal lobes 24 
Methods
Subject selection and follow up has been described in detail previously 22 In brief 33 subjects with PD meeting criteria consistent
with UK brain bank criteria according to a movement disorders specialist 25 achieving 36 month follow up are included here All subjects
were assessed at 0 18 and 36 months 
Baseline age sex education and other demographic features were
measured As previously described at baseline and every 18 months
Mini Mental Status Examination MMSE Frontal Assessment Battery
 FAB Dementia Rating Scale DRS II the 15 item Geriatric Depression
scale GDS were scored 22 The short Blessed Orientation Concentration Test FAB and a general and neurological examination including
rating the Unied Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale UPDRS Part III 
were performed by a neurologist RC who recorded co morbid medical
conditions Cumulative Illness Rating Scale CIRS 22 Levodopa
equivalent doses were calculated as previously described Assessments
of PD patients were performed in the ON state 
2 1 Dementia classication
Patients were classied as previously described 22 Subject and
caregiver derived Clinical Dementia Ratings scores CDR and CCDR 
were obtained as previously described 26 Dementia was dened as
cognitive impairment in two domains with functional impairment due
to cognitive decline based on all available information independent of
neuro imaging Memory impairment was not necessary i e modied
from DSM IV which was available at the time of study inception 27 
Participants with signicant cognitive or functional decline on the
MMSE DRS or CDR or CCDR were considered impaired PDD Subjects
with questionable changes in cognitive function or without functional
impairment were grouped with non impaired subjects PDND 
2 2 MR imaging
Images were acquired on a Siemens Sonata 1 5T system between December 2004 and August 2009 weighted images were obtained
using a 3 D magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence MPRAGE TR 1800 ms TE 3 2 ms TI 1100 ms 1 average ip angle 15 eld of view FOV 256 mm image matrix 
256  256 128 slices 1 5 mm slices with image slices oriented perpendicular to the AC PC line Native spatial resolution was 1  1  1 5 mm
which was zero lled to 0 5  0 5  1 5 mm Standard axial FLAIR images TR 8000 ms TE 99 ms 2 averages FOV 220 mm 25 slices 
5 mm slice thickness oriented to the inferior margin of the corpus
callosum were used to examine white matter changes and exclude
pathological lesions as previously described 22 
2 3 Intracranial volumes
Intracranial volumes ICV were measured from the weighted images using the program DISPLAY Montreal Neurological Institute Quebec 
Canada http www bic mni mcgill ca ServicesSoftwareVisualization 
HomePage as previously described 22 The intracranial volumes were
used to correct the grey and white matter volumes for individual
differences 
2 5 Voxel based morphometry
Image processing was done using the toolbox http 
dbm neuro uni jena de vbm for longitudinal data in running in
Matlab 7 8 0 In toolbox the 18 month and 36 month volumes
were initially realigned to the baseline volume then a mean image
was created and the three volumes realigned again to the mean
image All three volumes were then bias corrected and segmented
into GM WM and CSF Spatial normalization parameters were obtained
from the baseline image using the DARTEL Diffeomorphic Anatomical
Registration using Exponentiated Lie algebra 28 toolbox and applied
to all three volumes The standard template images provided by the
 toolbox based on the average brain were used for spatial normalization The toolbox for longitudinal image processing
produces unmodulated tissue segment volumes hence changes observed represent tissue concentration and not tissue volumes 29 30 
An 8 mm Gaussian smoothing kernel was applied prior to statistical
analysis was used for both cross sectional and longitudinal comparisons The comparisons between PDND and PDD groups at baseline
and 36 months were modeled using two between group factors dementia status and gender To examine changes with respect to time a
exible factorial model was used with dementia status and gender as
between subject factors and scan time baseline 18 month and
36 month as a within subject factor The interaction between dementia
classication and scan time was examined to see if and where the two
groups changed differently over time Baseline age and intracranial volume ICV were also included in all models For cluster level inference
31 32 a cluster dening threshold of uncorrected p b 0 001 was
used with the non stationarity adjustment 33 which accounts for differences in smoothness in the images The threshold cluster size that
corresponded to FWE cluster level corrected p value b 0 05 was then
used to lter the results Only signicant clusters are displayed in the
gures Additionally to test for more focal but stronger effects a voxelwise family wise error 34 FWE corrected p value b 0 05 was applied 
Results
There were no signicant baseline demographic or clinical differences at baseline between those who became cognitively impaired
and those who remained intact as shown in Table 1 The 36 month
data have been reported previously 22 
3 1 Voxel based morphometry
Contrasting dementia groups at baseline yielded no between group
voxel based differences at a peak FWE corrected signicance of
p b 0 05 Examining clusters we found a signicant cluster of decreased
grey matter density in the left uncus Brodmann area 38 Fig 1 and
Table 2 At 36 months a much larger cluster that also included the
left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus was evident Fig 2 and
Table 2 
Examining the dementia by time interaction a signicant cluster of
accelerated atrophy in PDD compared to PDND was found on the right
insula with a peak FWE p corrected threshold of p b 0 05 Fig 3 The
maximum t statistic is located at 33 21 19 mm in Talairach space
with a cluster extent of 133 voxels Using a cluster level threshold at
FWE p corrected 05 signicant clusters were identied in the right
insula and right and left hippocampus as well as low in the brain
stem indicating accelerated atrophy in these areas for PDD patients

Discussion
Groups were compared using Chi square or ANOVA as appropriate
using SPSS 20 Armonk NY Statistical thresholds were set at p b 0 05 
Here we show that there are clear differences in brain volume and
the rate of atrophy progression between PD patients showing

signicant cognitive decline compared to those remaining cognitively
stable Our previous study showed that simple to obtain global measures can be used to reliably track decline 22 Here we demonstrate
that the focal nature of these changes is consistent with regions that
have been shown to be affected at autopsy and correlate with cognitive
status 24 The summation of these changes likely leads to global
change as reected in ventricular dilatation 
Among the earlier longitudinal studies one showed an increased rate
of atrophy in PDD with no difference in the rate of atrophy between cognitively intact PD patients and controls 9 contrasting with another
study that found atrophy in both PD and PDD using VBM 10 PD patients with hallucinations who are at risk for dementia have been
shown to have focal atrophy 35 Longitudinal volumetric scans with
patients grouped according to smell abnormalities another potential
risk factor for dementia rather than cognitive decline 36 showed
that group with normal olfaction showed progressive changes in the
right amygdala and bilateral temporal lobes Recent studies suggest
that progressive cortical thinning is likely accelerated in patients with
mild cognitive impairment 37 and may be associated with incident
MCI 13 In addition to areas we show to be involved progressive
changes can be seen in more widespread cortical areas including the
temporal parietal and frontal lobes and deep structures such as the
thalamus and basal ganglia 38 Differences between studies are likely
based on imaging methods and characteristic of the subjects Our
study highlights the utility of brain MRI to track cognitive decline in a
typical treated patient population in agreement with Melzer et al 19 
A weakness of our study includes its relatively small sample size with
only 10 incident signicant cognitive decline dementia subjects On the
other hand a strength is the systematic longitudinal follow up We did
not use currently proposed PD dementia criteria which are still being validated 39 since they were not available at the time of study inception 
rather we used modied DSM IV criteria not requiring memory impairment Our grouping is likely clinically meaningful however given the
fact that cognitive decline correlated strongly with atrophy in our previous study 22 and that functional decline related to cognitive impairment
was evident in our subjects It should be acknowledged that the pathological contributions to cognitive decline in Parkinsons disease may be

The use of cluster level inference limits the ability to be precise about
the affected regions in the brain 32 In our case for example we were
able to specify a particular region in the right insula where GM atrophy
is accelerated in PDD compared to PDND using peak level inference 
When we used cluster level inference a larger cluster in the right
insula as well as clusters in the hippocampi and brain stem are revealed however we cannot specify where within these structures
these changes are occurring We identied a cluster 41 in the
brainstem that showed atrophy consistent with a previous study potentially consistent with pathological progression as hypothesized
by Braak et al 1 
Our study examined subjects who are at high risk for dementia 
by virtue of age and examined incident signicant cognitive decline
and dementia This suggests that MRI imaging can be used to track
the onset of meaningful decline There is some evidence that atrophy
may be reversible with interventions such as mindfulness therapy
42 suggesting that MRI may be useful as a biomarker in intervention studies The correspondence of the areas of change with pathologic data gives support to the notion that the ndings are
biologically meaningful Clearly future studies should follow patients
to autopsy to see if there is a correspondence between imaging ndings and autopsy ndings Our data add further support to the notion
that MRI detects meaningful changes which can complement other
biomarkers in predicting and tracking cognitive decline in Lewy
body diseases
