Meta analysis of 74 046 individuals identifies 11 new
susceptibility loci for Alzheimers disease
Eleven susceptibility loci for late onset Alzheimers disease
 LOAD were identified by previous studies however a large
portion of the genetic risk for this disease remains unexplained 
We conducted a large two stage meta analysis of genomewide association studies GWAS in individuals of European
ancestry In stage 1 we used genotyped and imputed data
 7 055 881 SNPs to perform meta analysis on 4 previously
published GWAS data sets consisting of 17 008 Alzheimers
disease cases and 37 154 controls In stage 2 11 632 SNPs
were genotyped and tested for association in an independent
set of 8 572 Alzheimers disease cases and 11 312 controls 
In addition to the APOE locus encoding apolipoprotein E 
19 loci reached genome wide significance P  5  108 in the
combined stage 1 and stage 2 analysis of which 11 are newly
associated with Alzheimers disease 
Alzheimers disease is a devastating neurological disorder primarily
affecting the elderly The disease manifests with progressive deterioration in cognitive functions leading to loss of autonomy The APOE
gene encoding apolipoprotein E is a major genetic risk factor for
Alzheimers 2 Previous GWAS in individuals of European
ancestry identified nine other genomic regions associated with
7 Recently a rare susceptibility variant in was 9 The search for additional genetic risk factors requires largescale meta analysis of GWAS to increase statistical power Under the
banner of I GAP International Genomics of Alzheimers Project we
conducted a meta analysis of 4 GWAS samples of European ancestry
totaling 17 008 cases and 37 154 controls stage 1 followed up by
genotyping of 11 632 SNPs showing moderate evidence of association
 P  1  103 in stage 1 in an independent sample that included 8 572
cases and 11 312 controls stage 2 
In the stage 1 meta analysis we used data from four consortia the
Alzheimers Disease Genetic Consortium ADGC the Cohorts for
Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology CHARGE 
Consortium the European Alzheimers Disease Initiative EADI and
the Genetic and Environmental Risk in Alzheimers Disease GERAD 
Consortium Table 1 Online Methods Supplementary Table 1 and
Supplementary Note We used European population reference EUR 
haplotype data from the 1000 Genomes Project 2010 interim release
based on sequence data freeze from 4 August 2010 and phased haplotypes from December 2010 to impute genotypes for up to 11 863 202
SNPs per data set We excluded SNPs that did not pass quality control
in each study Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Note 
Our meta analysis included SNPs either genotyped or successfully
imputed in at least 40 of the Alzheimers disease cases and 40 
of the control samples across all data sets 7 055 881 SNPs Online
Methods In each data set genotype dosages were analyzed as
described in the Supplementary Note Supplementary Table 2 We
performed meta analysis of the results after applying genomic control
correction to each study The genomic control inflation factor for the
meta analysis was 1 087 for the full set of SNPs and 1 082 after excluding SNPs within the APOE locus chr 19 45 409 03945 412 650 and
within 500 kb of SNPs associated with Alzheimers disease at a prespecified level of genome wide significance P  5  108 in stage 1
 see Supplementary Fig 1 for quantile quantile plots 
In addition to the APOE locus 14 genomic regions had associations that reached the genome wide significance level Fig 1 Nine

 had previously been identified as an Alzheimers disease gene
through candidate gene approaches and in a GWAS combining ADGC
and Asian Genes attributed to a signal were those closest
to the most significantly associated SNP However we are aware that
these are potentially not the causative genes Detailed results for each
region are given in Supplementary Figures 27 
In stage 2 we selected for genotyping all stage 1 SNPs with a
P value less than 1  103 excluding SNPs flanking APOE chr 19

From the initial set of SNPs 14 445 could be genotyped using Illumina
iSelect technology After quality control procedures Online Methods 
we considered 11 632 SNPs for association analysis The stage 2 sample
included 8 572 cases and 11 312 controls of European ancestry originating from Austria Belgium Finland Germany Greece Hungary 
Italy Spain Sweden the UK and the United States Table 1 and
Supplementary Note We observed 116 SNPs showing the same
risk allele and direction of association in stages 1 and 2 that were
significantly associated with Alzheimers disease risk in stage 2 after
a strict Bonferroni correction for multiple testing P  4 3  106 
Of these 116 SNPs 80 had been associated at genome wide signi
ficance with Alzheimers disease risk in stage 1 Additionally in analyses in stage 2 2 562 SNPs were associated with Alzheimers disease at
a nominal level of significance P  0 05 having the same risk allele
and direction of association as in stage 1 
The results from stages 1 and 2 and from the combined stage 1
and stage 2 data sets which represent a secondary discovery effort

domain 1 whose corresponding protein modulates epigenetic However the region defined by all the SNPs associated with
Alzheimers disease risk in our data is large and contains about ten
genes Supplementary Fig 9b Another interesting possible candidate gene in the region is as disruption of the
corresponding gene in mice affects brain size neurite elongation and 
more generally neuronal Our data do not resolve
which gene in this region may be causal 
A second locus was within the gene encoding CUGBP Elavlike family member 1 whose gene product is a member of the protein family that regulates pre mRNA alternative As with the
 locus the region of interest is large and contains about ten
genes Supplementary Fig 10a Among these genes is MADD encoding MAP kinaseactivating death domain the reduced expression of
which may affect long term neuronal viability in Alzheimers 
A discrete signal was observed adjacent to encoding NME 
 family member 8 which is responsible for primary ciliary
dyskinesia type 6 ref 28 
The gene encoding fermitin family member 2 is
expressed in the brain Its corresponding protein localizes to cell
matrix adhesion structures activates integrins is involved in the
orchestration of actin assembly and cell shape modulation and is
an important mediator of angiogenesis 29 An association between
the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of and

We identified a fifth signal on chromosome 20 at encoding Cas scaffolding protein family member 4 Little is known about
the function of the encoded protein However the Drosophila CASS

We identified a seventh signal adjacent to C encoding myocyte
enhancer factor 2 Mutations at this locus are associated with severe
mental retardation stereotypic movements epilepsy and cerebral The C protein limits excessive synapse formation
during activity dependent refinement of synaptic connectivity and thus
may facilitate hippocampal dependent learning and 
In summary our Alzheimers disease GWAS meta analysis has
identified 11 new susceptibility loci in addition to the already known
 APOE CLU AP E
and PICALM genes However we were not able to replicate association of in our stage 2 analysis P 0 61 We did not detect any
biases in terms of imputation in our discovery data sets or genotyping
in our replication data sets data not shown suggesting a potential
statistical fluctuation across our populations as an explanation for
the lack of replication However recent data suggest that genetically
determined decreased expression might reduce Alzheimers
disease risk and interfere with amyloid  peptide a dysfunction thought to be central in late onset forms of Alzheimers Further investigations in independent case control studies will
thus be required to confirm or refute the association of with
Alzheimers disease 
The newly associated loci reinforce the importance of some previously suspected pathways such as APP and and
tau and in pathology Several candidate genes at
these loci are involved in pathways already shown to be enriched
for association signal in Alzheimers disease 39 such as
immune response and inflammation  D
and C which is also supported by the described association
of Alzheimers disease with ref 3 and refs 8 9 cell
migration B and lipid transport and endocytosis 
Our results also suggest the existence of new pathways underlying
Alzheimers disease These pathways could include hippocampal synaptic function C and B cytoskeletal function and axonal
transport and regulation of gene expression
and post translational modification of proteins and microglial and
myeloid cell function D 
Examining the genetic effect attributable to all the associated
loci we demonstrated that the most strongly associated SNPs at
each locus other than APOE had population attributable fractions
 PAFs or preventive fractions between 1 08 0 in the stage 2
sample Supplementary Table 6 Strong efforts in sequencing
and post GWAS analyses will now be required to fully characterize the candidate genes and functional variants responsible for the
association of these GWAS identified loci with Alzheimers disease
risk and to understand their exact roles in the pathophysiology of
Alzheimers 41

All case control studies are described in Table 1 in the Supplementary Note
 see full description of the I GAP data sets and in Supplementary Tables 1 7
and 8 Written informed consent was obtained from study participants or for
those with substantial cognitive impairment from a caregiver legal guardian
or other proxy and the study protocols for all populations were reviewed and
approved by the appropriate institutional review boards 
Imputation and SNP selection for stage 1 analysis After quality control
criteria were finalized for each individual and each sample collection SNPs
with call rates of 95 were excluded Supplementary Note 
 ref 42 or MaCH software Supplementary Table 2 was used
to impute the genotypes of all participants with haplotypes derived from samples of European ancestry in the 1000 Genome Project 2010 interim release
based on the sequence data freeze from 4 August 2010 and phased haplotypes
from December 2010 In each data set SNPs with or info score quality
estimates of less than 0 3 as indicated by MaCH or respectively
 with these two quality estimates described to be equivalent were excluded
from analyses Similarly SNPs with a MAF of 1 were also excluded After
these procedures a maximum of 8 133 148 SNPs were retained that were
present in at least 1 data set 
In each case control data set the association of LOAD with genotype dosage was analyzed by a logistic regression model including covariates for age 
sex and principal components to adjust for possible population stratification
 Supplementary Table 2 For the three CHARGE cohorts with incident
Alzheimers disease data Cox proportional hazards models were used The four
consortia used different but analogous software for these analyses PLINK 44 
 or R Supplementary Table 2 Three of these tools
were applied to the EADI data set for quality control and very similar results
were observed After the exclusion of SNPs showing logistic regression coefficient   5 or P value equal to 0 or 1 the maximum number of SNPs in any
data set was 8 131 643 Each consortium uploaded summarized results for each
SNP to an internal I GAP website for access by members of each consortium 
SNPs genotyped or imputed in at least 40 of Alzheimers disease cases and
40 of control samples were included in the meta analysis This threshold
represented the best compromise between maximizing the total number of
SNPs and maximizing the number of samples in which the given SNP was
present Indeed analyzing all SNPs available in at least one study could have
greatly increased the risk of false positives On the other hand studying SNPs
only present in all studies could have led to the removal of SNPs of potential
interest even if those SNPs could have reached adequate statistical power in
a more limited number of data sets false negatives This approach allowed
us to increase homogeneity between studies for some SNPs by excluding poor
quality data present only in a limited number of data sets of small size This last
selection step led to a final number of 7 055 881 SNPs in stage 1 analysis 
iSelect microarray design and stage 2 SNP quality control SNPs associated with Alzheimers disease risk and exhibiting P value  1  103 in stage 1
analysis were selected for replication A list of 19 532 SNPs was submitted to
a devoted Illumina website to develop an iSelect microarray A total of 16 732
SNPs exhibiting an Illumina score superior or equal to 0 4 were selected for
microarray production During the Illumina production process 2 287 SNPs
failed oligonucleotide synthesis leading to a final number of 14 445 SNPs
for which genotyping was attempted Genotyping failure led to the further
exclusion of an additional 1 999 SNPs as a result of the SNPs i having no
intensity signal n 559 ii not being polymorphic n 1 176 iii only
being found in a heterozygous state n 248 or iv having mismatched alleles
compared to 1000 Genomes Project data n 16 Finally several quality control measures were applied to the remaining 12 446 SNPs to detect potential
biases in genotyping We first tested for discrepancies in allelic frequency
between the 1000 Genomes Project EUR reference panel and stage 2 data 
Allele frequencies for stage 2 data were estimated on 10 750 controls see
Stage 2 sample quality control and after exclusion of Finnish individuals 
The allelic test was performed with PLINK and P values were computed
by performing 4 500 000 permutations to avoid an assumption of HardyWeinberg equilibrium In total 798 SNPs showed a highly significant
difference in terms of allele frequency between the 1000 Genomes Project

EUR reference panel and stage 2 data P  1  105 Supplementary Fig 18 
and were excluded from the analysis 
Other SNP quality control steps were performed separately in data for each
country A SNP was considered of low genotyping quality in a country data
set if it had missing genotype data for more than 10 of the individuals if
the P value for the Hardy Weinberg test in controls was lower than 1  106
or if the P value for the test for differences in missingness between cases and
controls was lower than 1  106 see Supplementary Table 9 for differences
in missingness assessed for suggestive and significant hits across European
populations These quality control steps led to the removal of 16 SNPs with
low genotyping quality in data from all countries 
After SNP quality control 11 632 SNPs were considered to be of high genotyping quality in at least 1 country and were analyzed in stage 2 For imputed
data sets SNPs were considered to be of low imputation quality if their info
score was 0 3 
Of note of the 7 086 SNPs that we were unable to successfully genotype 
only 471 were not tagged by another successfully genotyped variant 100 kb 
and associated with a P value at least 10 times higher than that of the missing SNP Because the vast majority of the untagged SNPs exhibited stage 1
P values between 1  103 and 1  104 92 the likelihood of missing a true
association was considered to be low 
Stage 2 sample quality control The iSelect microarray contained 33 368 SNPs 
of which 11 632 were devoted to stage 2 These supplementary SNPs included
various genetic data that allowed us to further refine our quality control processes On the basis of data for all of these SNPs we excluded individuals who
had more than 3 missing genotypes showed a discrepancy between reported
sex and sex estimated on the basis of genetic data genetic sex or showed
evidence of non European ancestry Duplicated and related individuals were
identified Supplementary Table 10 Briefly discrepancies in sex were examined using genetic sex as estimated by PLINK on 40 SNPs on chromosome X 
We also removed 93 individuals from a single plate for whom an abnormal
number of discrepancies in sex were observed suggesting that sample mixing
had occurred Using a panel of 261 ancestry informative markers AIMs we
performed a principal component analysis PCA on HapMap 2 data with the
function SMARTPCA from EIGENSOFT 4 2 software 47 For each country 
individuals were projected onto the first two PCA axes to define their genetic
ancestry Individuals with evidence of non European ancestry were then identified by applying a Bayesian clustering approach 48 to their coordinates on
the first two axes Identity by descent IBD was computed for all pairs of
individuals using PLINK and individuals in a pair with IBD greater than 0 98
were considered to be duplicates If clinical data for duplicated individuals
were discordant both individuals were excluded Otherwise the individual
with the greater proportion of missing genotype was excluded Similarly IBD
was computed for all pairs of individuals in data from each country separately 
using 6 764 autosomal SNPs with MAF of 1 and selected to minimize LD 
Individuals in pairs with IBD greater than 0 2 were considered to be related
and were iteratively removed so as to obtain a sample of unrelated individuals
within each country data set 
Finally individuals with missing clinical data and controls less than
25 years of age were excluded from the analysis After sample quality
control Supplementary Table 10 19 884 individuals 8 572 cases and 11 312
controls were available for analysis in stage 2 
Statistical analysis For the stage 1 meta analysis we undertook fixed effects
inverse variance weighted meta analysis with the standard errors of the
 coefficient scaled by the square roots of study specific genomic inflation
factors estimated before combining the summary statistics across data sets 
Each consortium performed an independent stage 1 meta analysis after downloading the data files available on the I GAP website Two software packages were used for meta analysis and Very similar
results were generated independently of the software used and as expected 
perfect matching was observed between the analyses undertaken by each of
the 4 consortia 
For stage 2 association tests were performed for each country for all highquality genotyped SNPs under an additive model using logistic regression
as implemented in PLINK Analysis was adjusted for age sex and principal

c omponents when necessary Using SMARTPCA PCA was performed on
individuals from each country separately Difference in PCA coordinates
between cases and controls were tested for the first four principal components 
and analysis was further adjusted on principal components if the P value of this
test was lower than 0 05 PCA for Bonn stage 2 samples was based on GWAS
data For imputed data sets association tests were performed using likelihood
score tests for missing data as implemented in SNPTEST Genotyped and
imputed German samples were analyzed separately and results were then
combined by fixed effects meta analysis using the inverse variance approach
as implemented in METAL Using this approach a fixed effects meta analysis
was then performed to combine stage 2 results from the different countries 
We also performed the analysis separately for each center in stage 2 and combined the results by fixed effects meta analysis Results were similar to those
obtained when analysis was performed by country data not shown 
We finally generated fixed effects inverse varianceweighted meta analyses
by combining summary statistics across ADGC CHARGE EADI GERAD
and stage 2 data by country At this point we performed Cochrans Q test for
heterogeneity and generated estimates with METAL to evaluate the possible
effect of study heterogeneity on the results 
A graphic representation of the association signal in the stage 1 data was
generated with LocusZoom for all the loci of interest reaching a
genome wide significant level after combined stage 1 and stage 2 analyses 
PAF was calculated using the Levin 
Annotation of I GAP top SNPs for eQTLs To gain further biological insights 
we explored reported associations between SNPs in the top I GAP loci and
gene expression We first selected all SNPs that reached genome wide signi
ficance P value  5  108 in the combined stage 1 and stage 2 analysis
and were located in a 500 kb window upstream or downstream of the top

SNP at each locus Table 2 We then searched for published data on gene
expression associated with each of these SNPs in the eQTL database from the
Pritchard laboratory see URLs For each reported eQTL gene and each type
of eQTL association as defined in this database we then counted the number
of reported eQTL SNPs and selected the one with the lowest P value
