Introduction
A consensus panel from the United States and Europe was
convened recently to update and revise the 1997 30
consensus guidelines for the neuropathologic evaluation of
Alzheimers disease AD Here we summarize these
consensus guidelines 29 and provide direction for their
application 
Clinico pathologic correlation
Alzheimers disease refers to a constellation of cognitive
and behavioral changes that are typical for patients who
have substantial amounts of its hallmark lesions 6 39 
Similar neuropathologic changes albeit usually at lower
levels also occur in individuals who did not show cognitive or behavioral impairments during life 54 We
recommend that neuropathologists adopt the term AD
neuropathologic change and report on the presence and
extent of lesions observed at autopsy regardless of the
individuals cognitive state or even if cognitive state is not
known 
AD neuropathologic change should be assessed in all
cases of dementia There are many other neurodegenerative
disorders that can cause dementia in addition to those
discussed here and any may be co morbid with AD neuropathologic change especially in the elderly We
recommend that all lesions be documented for type and
extent of co morbidity in brains of individuals with AD
neuropathologic change 
Multiple diseases in cerebrum can conspire to worsen
cognitive symptoms however it often is difficult to judge
the extent to which each disease observed at autopsy may
have contributed to a given patients cognitive state It is
essential that the extent of AD neuropathologic change as
well as neuropathologic findings for any other disease s that may have contributed to cognitive impairment
or dementia be correlated with clinical neuropsychological neuro imaging and other laboratory data as part of the
neuropathology report

Work up of cases
Autopsy should follow best practices and local regulations 
Gross inspection of brain should include assessment of
regional atrophy and blood vessels for cerebrovascular
disease CVD We recommend a minimum sampling of
brain regions in Table 1 All gross lesions also should be
sampled Each of the following sections indicates preferred
and acceptable alternative methods for detection of neuropathologic changes While we do not propose specific
protocols our recommendations are compatible with conclusions by others who have optimized reproducibility
of some neuropathologic assessments across multiple sites
25 41 We anticipate further efforts for increased
harmonization and molecular specification Finally 
although organized for brain autopsy these neuropathologic
assessments can be applied to specimens from surgery 
however regional evaluation will be limited in biopsy
specimens 
AD neuropathologic change
Senile plaques which are extracellular deposits of the
b amyloid Ab peptides and neurofibrillary degeneration 
which is best exemplified by neurofibrillary tangles
 NFTs are considered essential neuropathologic features
of AD Accumulation of Ab plaques and NFTs follows
distinct regional progressions across brain regions as AD
advances We recommend continued use of the staging
scheme for neurofibrillary degeneration as described originally by Braak and Braak 14 15 reduced to four stages
 Table 2 that improves inter rater reliability 42 We
recommend a modified version of Thal phases of Ab plaque accumulation 57 adapted to a four point scale
 Table 2 A subset of senile plaques called neuritic plaques appear closely associated with neuronal injury and are
characterized by the occurrence of dystrophic neurites that
frequently have phospho tau immunoreactivity 19 36 37 
55 We recommend continued use of the Consortium to
Establish a Registry for AD CERAD protocol for neuritic
plaque scoring 41 Table 2 
Method
Preferred method for b amyloid Ab plaques is immunohistochemistry for Ab and for neurofibrillary tangles
 NFTs is immunohistochemistry for tau or phospho tau
14 Other acceptable methods are Thioflavin S or sensitive silver histochemical stains 15 It is important to
stress that neuritic plaques need to be distinguished from
Ab deposits by special stains Preferred methods for
detection of neuritic processes in senile plaques are

Each brain region should receive a hematoxylin and eosin H E stain In addition regions are recommended for additional stains to reveal
Alzheimers disease AD neuropathologic change and Lewy body disease LBD A tiered approach to assessment of Ab amyloid plaques and
LBD is recommended to reflect their typically ordered appearance in brain While NFTs also typically follow an ordered appearance in AD we
recommend wider screening to assist in capturing other tauopathies H E stained sections can be used for evaluating vascular brain injury VBI 
in each region and hippocampal sclerosis HS as designated We recommend that enumeration of microvascular lesions MVLs for clinicopathologic correlations with cognitive impairment and dementia be limited to the six regions that are italicized Other lesions should be sampled
as appropriate
Stains for Ab amyloid plaques should be considered in other regions not needed for classification such as in the precuneus or cingulate as

not considered in the ABC score it is very commonly
observed in cases with parenchymal Ab plaques and should
be evaluated and reported systematically as well as

Reporting
For all cases regardless of clinical history reporting
should follow the format of these examples Alzheimer
Disease Neuropathologic Change  or Alzheimer Disease Neuropathologic Change  
Using the system shown in Table 3 the ABC scores are
transformed into one of four levels of AD neuropathologic
change Not Low Intermediate or High 
Clinico pathologic correlations
Clinico pathologic correlations for individuals without
cognitive impairment should indicate that it is possible for
AD neuropathologic change to predate onset of symptoms
by years 54 For individuals with cognitive impairment at
the time tissue was obtained Intermediate or High
level Table 3 black background of AD neuropathologic
change should be considered adequate explanation of
cognitive impairment or dementia and should be reported
with a final diagnosis of Alzheimers disease Low level
of AD neuropathologic change is not considered adequate
explanation for cognitive impairment or dementia In all
cases with cognitive impairment regardless of the extent of
AD neuropathologic change it is essential to determine the
presence or absence as well as extent of other disease s that might have contributed to the clinical deficits 
For cases with incomplete clinical history higher levels of
AD neuropathologic change typically are correlated with
greater likelihood of cognitive impairment 29

previous consensus guidelines 38 to classify LBD in five
stages 
Method
LBs may be detected in neurons of medulla pons and
midbrain with hematoxylin and eosin H E stained sections however greater sensitivity can be achieved with
immunohistochemistry for a synuclein and this approach is
strongly preferred 3 4 13 Abnormal neuropil and neuronal cytoplasmic a synuclein immunoreactivity are
usually present with LBs but will not be apparent by H E 
in some instances these changes occur in the absence of
LBs 
Classification of all types of LBD should fall into a one
of five categories following a modification of existing
criteria Fig 4 16 38 none brainstem predominant 
limbic transitional neocortical diffuse or amygdala

d
Medial temporal lobe NFTs in the absence of significant Ab or neuritic plaques occurs in older people and may be seen in individuals without
cognitive impairment with mild impairment or with cognitive impairment from causes other than AD 44 Consider other diseases when
clinically or pathologically indicated
e
Widespread NFTs with some Ab amyloid plaques but limited neuritic plaques is relatively infrequent and when it occurs other diseases 
particularly tauopathies should be considered Such cases may not fit easily into a specific Braak stage which is intended for categorization of
AD type NFTs
f
High levels of neuritic plaques in setting of low Thal phase is a rare occurrence and should prompt reconsideration of neuritic versus diffuse
plaques and the possible contribution of other diseases to cognitive impairment or dementia
g
Higher levels of Ab or neuritic plaques with low Braak stage should prompt consideration of contribution by co morbidities like vascular brain
injury Lewy body disease or hippocampal sclerosis Also consider additional sections as well as repeat or additional protocols to demonstrate
other non AD lesions
predominant Table 4 Although not part of this classification scheme it is important to realize that LBD also
occurs frequently in the olfactory bulb in older adults and
should be sampled when possible 20 
Reporting
For all cases regardless of clinical history reporting
should follow the format of these examples Lewy body
disease limbic or Lewy body disease amygdalapredominant 
Clinico pathologic correlation for individuals without
cognitive impairment should indicate that although much
less common than AD neuropathologic change LBD has
been observed in individuals without apparent cognitive or
motor deficit 1 49 this may represent pre clinical LBD
12 22 31 For individuals with cognitive impairment we
recommend that Neocortical LBD be considered adequate explanation of cognitive impairment or dementia
 Table 4 italicized however this does not preclude
contribution from other diseases Brainstem predominant
LBD in the setting of cognitive impairment should
prompt consideration of other diseases Amygdala predominant LBD typically occurs in the context of
advanced AD neuropathologic change 59 For cases with
incomplete clinical history we note that Neocortical
LBD is correlated with greater likelihood of cognitive
impairment 1 1113 22 3133 38 46 49 52 
Cerebrovascular disease and vascular brain injury
CVD and vascular brain injury VBI 50 commonly are
encountered in the brains with AD neuropathologic change
25 We recommend reporting all macroscopic VBI and
enumerating microvascular lesions or MVLs microscopic
infarcts hemorrhages in standard screening sections 26 
51 53 60 Diffuse white matter injury is a form of VBI
but it is more difficult to judge objectively and is not
specific to VBI

impairment or dementia LBD also occurs early in olfactory bulb and even can occur outside of the brain

relationship to cognitive function while multiple MVLs in
these regions are associated with increased likelihood of

Hippocampal sclerosis HS is defined by pyramidal cell
loss and gliosis in and subiculum of the hippocampal
formation that is out of proportion to AD neuropathologic
change in the same structures 7 HS can be observed in the
context of AD neuropathologic change frontotemporal
lobar degeneration FTLD and VBI likely reflecting a
heterogeneous etiology We recommend that HS be reported as present or absent 
 immunoreactive inclusions are observed in the
majority of cases of HS Fig 6 8 28 40 64 about onehalf of cases with FTLD and ubiquitin inclusions with or
without motor neuron disease most sporadic cases of
amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and commonly in cases with
AD neuropathologic change 8 9 or with LBD 43 as
well as other neurodegenerative diseases 48 With the
exception of individuals with mutations in TARDBP GRN 
VCP or 10 18 it is not clear whether 
proteinopathy in these other neurodegenerative diseases is
a primary secondary or coincidental event 63 
Method and classification
HS should be evaluated by hematoxylin and eosin H E stained sections together with neurofibrillary tangle NFT 
stains HS can be focal thus its absence in the recommended screening section does not rule out the possibility
of HS elsewhere in the hippocampal formation If HS is
present further evaluation is indicated including 
immunohistochemistry If work up is negative for 
Acta Neuropathol 2012 123 111
but there is other evidence to suggest FTLD consider
immunohistochemistry for phospho tau ubiquitin or
fused in sarcoma FUS In the absence of HS screening
for inclusions as part of evaluating AD neuropathologic change is of unclear value 
Reporting
HS should be reported as present or absent with a
description of immunohistochemistry results 
Clinico pathological correlations need to recognize that
HS can occur in several different diseases and has varying
clinical implications in different settings Relatively isolated HS may occur in very old individuals and in this
context it is associated with immunoreactive
inclusions and with cognitive impairment 45 47 
Frontotemporal lobar degeneration and prion disease
Both of these classes of neurodegenerative diseases are
complex and beyond the scope of this summary Nevertheless each must be distinguished from AD
neuropathologic change We refer the reader to recent
consensus guidelines for the neuropathologic evaluation of
FTLD and its subtypes 17 34 35 and issues important in
the distinction of AD neuropathologic change from those
of some forms of FTLD 58 Finally not only can the
neuropathologic changes of prion disease be co morbid
with AD but some forms of prion disease can overlap with
AD and need to be distinguished with special stains 23 
Summary
The new consensus criteria recognize the continuum of AD
neuropathologic change that underlies the progression of
this disease from preclinical to dementia stage The new
consensus criteria also amplify methods for evaluating Ab
plaques better define intermediate levels of AD pathologic
change and emphasize a structured approach to commonly
co morbid diseases
