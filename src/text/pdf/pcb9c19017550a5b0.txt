Abstract
Objective Although Parkinsons disease PD is frequently
accompanied by depression brain perfusion deficits in PD
with depression remain unclear This study aimed to assess
alterations in regional cerebral blood flow rCBF in
depressed PD patients using 99mTc hexamethyl propyleneamine oxime single photon emission computed tomography SPECT 
Methods Among 78 patients with PD 35 patients were
classified into the depressed PD group while the rest 43
patients was assigned to the nondepressed PD group based
on the scores of the Geriatric Depressive Scale GDS All
participants underwent brain SPECT imaging The voxelwise whole brain analysis and region of interest ROI 
analysis of the limbic areas were conducted to compare
rCBF between the depressed and nondepressed PD groups 
Results The depressed PD patients demonstrated higher
GDS scores than nondepressed patients whereas betweengroup differences in the PD severity and cognitive function
were not significant Perfusion in the left cuneus was
increased while that in the right superior temporal gyrus

Introduction
Although Parkinsons disease PD is primarily characterized by several motor symptoms including tremor rigidity 
and bradykinesia it is frequently accompanied by other
nonmotor symptoms such as depression anxiety fatigue 
and sleep disturbance 1 Among these depression is one
of the most common nonmotor symptoms of PD and the
prevalence of major depressive disorder was reported as
17 in PD patients according to the meta analysis 2 If
minor depression and dysthymia are included the prevalence increases to 52 in PD population much higher
than that in general population 2 The underlying neurobiological mechanism of the close association between
PD and depression is not well defined It is possible that
disabling symptoms of PD may cause distress and negative
feelings However a number of studies have suggested that
Ann Nucl Med
degeneration of the mesolimbic and mesocortical pathways
may be related to depression in PD 3 4 
To investigate the neural substrates underlying depressive symptoms in PD only a few studies using singlephoton emission computed tomography SPECT have
examined regional cerebral blood flow rCBF in the PD
patients with and without depression However the results
regarding rCBF differences between the depressed and
nondepressed PD patients have been inconsistent One
study revealed increased rCBF in the fronto parietal areas
of the depressed PD patients 5 whereas rCBF reduction
in the frontal cortex was found in the depressed PD group
of the other study 6 Furthermore the sample sizes of
these studies were relatively small 
This study aimed to assess alterations in rCBF in
depressed PD patients compared with nondepressed PD
group using 99mTc hexamethyl propylene amine oxime
 HMPAO SPECT Since the whole brain voxel wise
analysis of the SPECT images might miss rCBF differences on a regional level we further used a region ofinterest ROI approach for the major limbic areas which
are implicated in depression 7 by averaging all voxel
values within each region Finally the relationships
between rCBF and the severity of depression were
examined 
Materials and methods
Participants
Patients who had been diagnosed as PD without history of
other neurological and psychiatric disorders were recruited
at Incheon St Marys Hospital Incheon South Korea 
Written informed consent was obtained from all participants and the study protocol was approved by the Research
Ethics Committee 
The severity of PD symptoms was evaluated with the
HoehnYahr Scale 8 The Korean Mini Mental State
Examination MMSE was used to assess global cognitive
function 9 The total score ranges from 0 to 30 with a
higher score indicating a better cognitive performance 
The cut off score of 18 was suggested for screening of
dementia 10 Depressive symptoms were examined
using the Korean version of the Geriatric Depressive
Scale GDS 11 The total score ranges from 0 to 30 and
a higher score represents greater depressive symptoms 
The cut off score of 14 was suggested for screening of
depression 11 Participants were divided into the
depressed and nondepressed PD groups based on the cutoff score of the GDS 
Image acquisition
All participants were scanned 40 min after intravenous
injection of 1110 MBq of HMPAO using a dual head
gamma camera ECAM plus Siemens Medical Erlangen 
Germany The participants were rested in a supine position
with their eyes open in a low light and low noise environment during the scan All images were attenuation
corrected and reconstructed in a 128 9 128 matrix with a
voxel size of 3 9 9 3 9 9 3 9 mm field of view 240 mm 
using filtered back projection 
Image processing and analysis
Statistical Parametric Mapping 8 Wellcome
Department of Cognitive Neurology Institute of Neurology London UK was used for image processing and
statistical modelling All images were spatially normalized
to the SPM SPECT template Montreal Neurological
Institute McGill University Montreal Canada and resliced with a voxel size of 2 9 2 9 2 The SPM
binary brain mask was applied to remove extracerebral
signal The images were smoothed with a 16 mm fullwidth half maximum isotropic Gaussian kernel 
A voxel wise two sample t test was conducted to
examine differences in rCBF between the two groups with
age and gender as nuisance covariates Global counts were
normalized to 50 mL 100 g min with proportional scaling 
and relative threshold masking of 0 8 was applied The
statistical threshold was set at uncorrected p  0 001 at
voxel level with an extent threshold of 100 voxels Normalized rCBF values were extracted from each significant
cluster using MarsBar toolbox version 0 44 http marsbar 
sourceforge net 12 
For the ROI analysis four bilateral ROIs in the limbic
system were selected based on the previous review of
neuroimaging studies in depression 7 the amygdala 
anterior cingulate cortex hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus The WFU PickAtlas toolbox version 3 0 5
 http fmri wfubmc edu software pickatlas 13 was used
to create binary masks for these ROIs using the Automated
Anatomical Labeling atlas 14 Normalized rCBF value of
each ROI was extracted using MarsBar toolbox 12 
Statistical analysis
Differences in continuous variables between two groups
were examined with independent t tests or MannWhitney
U tests Chi square test was used to compare the ratio of
gender 
To assess correlations between rCBF and depressive
symptoms multiple linear regressions were performed in
Ann Nucl Med
the depressed PD group with normalized rCBF value from
each cluster as an independent variable and the GDS score
as a dependent variable while adjusting for age and gender For each ROI difference in the normalized rCBF
between the two groups was assessed using multiple linear
regression with age and gender as covariates of no interest 
A two tailed p value of less than 0 05 without correction
for multiple comparison was considered statistically significant since the correlation and ROI analyses were based
on specific hypotheses All analyses were conducted with

Discussion
Results
A total of 78 patients with PD were included in this study 
Among them 35 patients were classified into the depressed
PD group while the rest 43 patients was assigned to the
nondepressed PD group based on the GDS scores No
patients were on antidepressant medication at the time of
the assessments Demographic and clinical characteristics

Results from the voxel wise SPM analysis were summarized in Table 2 and Fig 1 The depressed PD group
showed increased rCBF in the left cuneus t 3 55 cluster
size 129 voxels In contrast significantly lower rCBF was
found in the right superior temporal gyrus t 71 
cluster size 298 voxels and right medial orbitofrontal
The current brain perfusion SPECT study investigated
differences in rCBF between the depressed and nondepressed PD patients Correlations between rCBF and the
severity of depressive symptoms were also examined in the
depressed PD group We found increased rCBF in the
cuneus and perfusion reduction in the superior temporal
gyrus medial orbitofrontal cortex and four limbic ROIs 
including the anterior cingulate cortex amygdala hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus in the depressed
PD group In addition the rCBF in the cuneus cluster was
positively associated with depressive symptoms in the
depressed PD patients 
The voxel wise image analysis revealed that the
depressed PD group relative to the nondepressed group
showed higher rCBF in the cuneus and occipital areas
which were associated with their greater depressive
symptoms In line with these results the previous study
using PET demonstrated the dysphoria related topographic
pattern of glucose metabolism in PD patients which was
characterized by metabolic increases in the medial occipital areas and the decrease in the frontal lobe 15 
Increased glucose metabolism in the cuneus and surrounding areas has also been implicated in geriatric
depression of PD patients 16 17 Furthermore the

depression Inverse correlations between the GABA levels
and rCBF in the brain have also been suggested by the
previous literature 21 22 Further studies are warranted
to examine structural functional or metabolic changes in
the occipital area and potential visual impairments in PD
with depression since both subjective visual deficits 23
and changes of visual evoked potential 24 25 were
observed in patients with major depression 
On the other hand decreased rCBF in the superior
temporal and medial orbitofrontal cortices was found in the
depressed PD patients These results correspond with the
findings of the previous neuroimaging studies in major
depression that have consistently reported both functional
and structural alterations in these areas 2628 The
superior temporal gyrus in combination with the frontolimbic areas orbitofrontal cortex amygdala and anterior
cingulate cortex has been known to be involved in emotional processing and social cognition 29 30 Functional
neuroimaging studies demonstrated that patients with
major depression exhibited abnormal functional connectivity 31 and decreased activation at rest or to sad stimuli
in this region 26 Furthermore regional volume of
superior temporal gyrus was negatively associated with
severity of depressive symptoms 28 The rCBF decrease
in the medial orbitofrontal area is in line with the previous
studies that revealed hypometabolism in the same region in
depressed PD patients when compared with nondepressed
PD patients 15 32 Interestingly the orbitofrontal cortex 
which has reciprocal connections with both the ventral
tegmental area and dorsal raphe may play important roles
in the pathophysiology of depression with PD 33 34 
Although still speculative the degeneration of dopaminergic system may cause the functional deficits in orbitofrontal cortex which in turn may affect serotonergic
system and cause depressive symptoms 
The ROI analysis of this study revealed lower rCBF in
the limbic system including the anterior cingulate cortex 
amygdala hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus of the
depressed PD patients Lower rCBF in the anterior cingulate cortex was also suggested from the previous report
35 However rCBF alterations in the amygdala hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus have not been
suggested in the previous studies of depressed PD patients
5 35 36 In addition perfusion studies of major
depression have also demonstrated inconsistent results
regarding the activation of the limbic regions 3740 Our
results suggest that depression with PD may be characterized by coherent decreases of rCBF in the major limbic
areas 
Potential limitations of this study include a group difference in gender ratio although gender was covaried out
in the statistical analyses The epidemiological and other
studies of PD showed controversial results whether there is
a gender difference in the prevalence of comorbid
depression 41 42 while gender difference in major
depression has been well documented 43 However there
is still a possibility that neural correlates of depression in
PD may be different between genders and therefore further studies are warranted to investigate this issue The
reliance on the self report questionnaires for the assessment of depressive symptoms is another weakness of this
study due to the potential response bias Complementary
use of structured clinical interviews would be helpful in
future research 
In summary this study identified the regional pattern of
brain perfusion that distinguished depressed from nondepressed PD patients Hyperperfusion in the occipital area
and hypoperfusion in the fronto temporo limbic regions
may be potential imaging biomarkers for depression in PD 
However although the mean rCBF values of the ROIs
significantly differed between depresssed and nondepressed PD groups the perfusion ranges considerably
overlapped between the two groups Therefore our findings should be confirmed and validated in prospective
studies with a larger cohort for the development of reliable
and robust biomarkers for depression in PD
