Summary We studied the usefulness of measuring volumes of the hippocampus amygdala and frontal lobes with coronal magnetic resonance
imaging MRI scans in the diagnosis of early Alzheimers disease AD 
We examined 32 patients diagnosed according to the NINCDS ADRDA
criteria of probable AD and 16 age matched healthy cognitively normal controls The AD patients had mild dementia with a mean score of 22 8 in the
Mini Mental Status Examination MMSE We used a 1 5 T magnetic resonance imager and normalized the volumes for brain area The AD patients
had significantly smaller volumes of the right and the left hippocampus
 3 8 ANOVA p  0 0001 and the left frontal lobe 1 6 p  0 05 
compared to controls The reductions in volumes of the right frontal
lobe 1 3 the right amygdala 1 4 or the left amygdala 1 8 
were not statistically significant In the discriminant function analysis which
included the volumes of the hippocampus amygdala and the frontal lobes
and age the volumes of the left and right hippocampus the left and
right frontal lobe and the right amygdala entered the model and we could
correctly classify 92 of the subjects into AD and control groups Chi square
42 6 df 5 p  0 0001 By using the volumes of the hippocampus the frontal
lobes or the amygdala on their alone the correct classification was achieved
in 88 65 and 58 of the subjects respectively In addition in AD
patients the volumes of the left hippocampus correlated significantly with the
MMSE score and with immediate and delayed verbal memory the smaller the
volume the more impaired was their performance Our data indicate that
measurements of volumes of the hippocampus might be useful in diagnosis of
early AD

Introduction
There are problems in the clinical diagnosis of Alzheimers disease AD an
accuracy of between 80 is the best one can achieve Sulkava et al 1983 
McKhann et al 1984 Thus the definitive diagnosis can be obtained only by
means of biopsy or autopsy McKhann et al 1984 Imaging methods computed tomography CT and magnetic resonance imaging MRI are an
integral part of the diagnostic assessment of patients with suspected dementia
and help to detect specific central nervous system causes of dementia such as
brain tumor vascular lesions normal pressure hydrocephalus and chronic
subdural haematoma The value of linear planimetric and volumetric measurements of various regions of interest on CT scans have been under scrutiny
in attempts to separate AD patients from elderly controls DeCarli et al 
1990 Recently similar approaches have been applied with MRI scans MRI
studies though varying to some extent have shown interesting and promising
results in providing a reliable non invasive method for the diagnosis of AD 
Therefore we wanted to confirm some of the previous results and seek a
reliable means of improving the accuracy of the diagnosis of AD by volumetric measurements using MRI 
Previous studies applying CT have shown that volumetric measurements
were able to classify up to 90 of AD patients and control subjects DeCarli
et al 1990 Functional techniques such as measuring cerebral glucose metabolism and regional cerebral blood flow with positron emission tomography
and single photon emission computed tomography SPECT have also been
used for the diagnosis of AD Haxby et al 1986 Pearlson et al 1992 
SPECT measurements alone were able to differentiate 88 of the ADpatients from the controls By combining SPECT with MRI the results have
been even better Pearlson et al 1992 Magnetic resonance spectroscopy a
method recently introduced to study metabolism of the brain has also been
utilized in examining AD patients Bottomley et al 1992 Klunk et al 1992 
Longo et al 1993 Furthermore measurement of magnetic resonance 
relaxation time in the hippocampus has shown promising results with the
prolongation of the relaxation time correlating with the severity of AD
symptoms Kirsch et al 1993 
Earlier studies on the volumetric MRI diagnosis of AD and also on the
normal variations and the changes in aging have focused on the temporal lobe
as a whole or individually on the temporal neocortex the superior temporal
gyrus the hippocampal formation the uncus the entorhinal cortex the
parahippocampal gyrus and the amygdala Ventricular spaces of interest have
been the ventricles the temporal horns the interuncal distance the temporal
sulci and the Sylvian fissures as well as the choroidal fissure the subarachnoid
space and the cerebrospinal fluid Moreover several extratemporal regions
have been measured such as the brain parenchyma the frontal cortex the
parietal cortex the corpus callosum the basal forebrain and the basal ganglia 
striatum nucleus caudatus and nucleus lenticularis Seab et al 1988

Killiany et al 1993 
In aging MRI studies have detected decreased volumes of the anterior
diencephalic structures of the grey matter of most cortical regions especially
of association cortices and mesial temporal lobe structures Jernigan et al 
1991 and of the caudate nucleus Krishnan et al 1990 Jernigan et al 1991 
The age related changes in the white matter are also manifest as prolonged
 values Jernigan et al 1991 The volumes of the lateral ventricles have
been reported to increase by 3 2 per year Coffey et al 1992 There are
also normal variations in the temporal lobe including notching of the uncus
and asymmetry of the temporal horns Mild asymmetry of the hippocampal
head and mild enlargement of the right temporal lobe were not uncommon 
Other variations were subtle asymmetry of the white matter between the
hippocampus and the collateral sulcus atypical sulci and Sylvian fissure dilatation Bronen and Cheung 1991a 
Despite the intense effort to define an accurate variable a structure a
combination of structures or even a combination of structural and functional
measurements to reveal early AD no uniformity or simple answer has been
achieved The Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers Disease
 CERAD has tried to develop procedures for standardized imaging and
reporting MRI findings but no satisfactory interrater agreement for interpreting MRI findings in elderly subjects was found Acceptable intraclass correlations in a group of 14 neuroradiologist were obtained only in the ratings of the
lateral and third ventricles and the temporal horn What is needed are more
objective and reproducible procedures for interpretation of neuroimaging
findings of AD Davis et al 1992 
We chose the hippocampus and the amygdala as well as a neocortical
region the frontal lobe as regions of interest Memory loss is the most
common early symptom in AD The hippocampus which is closely associated
with memory processing is known to be vulnerable to damage in the early
stage of AD Hyman et al 1984 The purpose of our study was to assess the
usefulness of MRI volume measurements in the diagnosis of early AD To this
end we measured the volumes of the hippocampus the amygdala and the
frontal lobes using thin slices to obtain as precise information as possible To
test the value of volume measurements as a tool to separate AD patients from
controls we applied a discriminant function analysis We also correlated the
volumes of these brain regions with the patients performance on tests assessing verbal and visual memory as well as executive functions

The controls have been described in detail elsewhere Soininen et al 1994 Their
investigation also included clinical neurological examination neuropsychological testing 
EEG event related evoked potentials and MRI 
Neuropsychological tests
Verbal memory was examined with the list learning test using shopping items Helkala et
al 1988 A yes or no recognition of the words in the list was asked after a 30 minute
delay filled with other psychometric tests We also used the story recall test with the
Boston approach Millber et al 1986 The recall of the story was tested immediately and
after a 30 minute delay Visual memory was examined with Heaton Visual Reproduction
Test Russel 1975 The recall of the figures was tested both immediately and after a 30minute delay 
To assess executive functions we used Nelsons version of the Wisconsin Card Sorting
Test Nelson 1976 Trail Making test A and B Reitan 1958 and Verbal Fluency
 Borkowski et al 1967 The maximum time of 150 seconds for Trail Making A and 300
seconds of Trail Making B was allowed If the test was not completed in the time allowed 
the missing letters or numbers were scored as omissions In the Verbal Fluency Test the
subject was asked to produce as many words as they could beginning with letters
P A and S in one minute for each letter The score was the number of words correctly
named Furthermore we examined verbal functions with the Boston Naming Test

MRI volumetry in Alzheimers disease
M R I imaging technique
The subjects were scanned with a 1 5 T Magnetom Siemens Erlangen using the standard head coil and a tilted coronal 3D gradient echo sequence MP RAGE TR 10 ms TE
4ms TI 250ms flip angle 12 FOV 250mm matrix 256  192 1 acquisition This
resulted in 128 Tl weighted partitions with slice thickness of 1 5 8 mm oriented at a
right angle to the long axis of the hippocampus The radiologist who analyzed the MRIs
was blinded to the subjects clinical diagnosis 
We used standard anatomical atlases of the human brain Duvernoy 1988 
DeArmond et al 1989 with some adjustment from previous articles Naidich et al 1987 
Bronen and Cheung 1991b Tien et al 1992 Watson et al 1992 as guidelines to
determine the boundaries of the amygdala and the hippocampus in oblique coronal MRI
sections The method has been reported previously in detail Soininen et al 1994 The
boundaries of the region of interest were outlined by a trackball driven cursor and the
number of voxels within the region was calculated by using an in house developed
program for standard work console The outlining of the boundaries always proceeded
from anterior to posterior 
The outlines of the amygdala included the deep nuclei of the amygdala the superficial
nuclei of the amygdala and the remaining nuclei of the amygdala At the most rostral
sections of the amygdala we outlined only the deep amygdaloid nuclei in the MRI image
to avoid any overestimation of the amygdaloid volume due to inclusion of the piriform
cortex The hippocampus included the dentate gyrus the hippocampus proper and the
subicular complex The uncal portion of the rostral hippocampus that is located ventral to
the caudal amygdala was included into the hippocampus The caudal end of the hippocampus was determined from the section in which the fornices were still detectable in
their full length 
To determine the volumes of the frontal lobes the gyri were manually outlined on
every third slice Thus due to thin slices the measurement was done at an interval of
5 mm The most anterior of the slices was the one with clearly visible gyri On the most
posterior slices a straight line was drawn from the bottom of the lateral fissure to the
choroidal fissure in order to separate the temporal lobe from the frontal lobe From the
bottom of the choroidal fissure a line was drawn above the optic tract to the midline and
then a line was drawn vertically to the interhemispheric cerebral fissure The most caudal
slice included in the measurement was the one in which the anterior commissure was
present The volume of the lateral ventricles was also measured and consequently subtracted from the volume of the slice The volume of each slice was multiplied by three and
thereafter the slice volumes were summed 
In the statistical analysis we used volumes of the region of interest normalized for the
brain area Normalization was done by dividing the volumes of the hippocampus 
amygdala or the frontal lobe by brain area To obtain brain area we measured the area
of both hemispheres in a MR image taken at the level of the anterior commissure The
normalization yielded ratios volume of the region of interest brain area We used normalized values in all statistical analyses 
The intrarater agreement of this method has been reported earlier Soininen et al 
1994 The interrater reproducibility between two raters was tested in 16 subjects The
differences between the volumes obtained by two raters compared to the mean of these
two measurements were 4 1 for the right hippocompus and 1 6 for the left hippocampus 8 7 for the right amygdala and 3 7 for the left amygdala 
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed by utilizing SPSS PC V 4 1 software SPSS Inc Chicago IL 
In all statistical analyses of the volumetric data we used volumes normalized for brain
area Analysis of variance ANOVA was used to compare the means between the study
groups Correlations were calculated by using Pearsons correlation two tailed test To test
the accuracy of volume measurements to distinguish AD patients from controls we used

Discussion
This study focused on m e a s u r e m e n t of volumes of the hippocampus 
amygdala and frontal lobes O u r purpose was to search for a reliable means
for diagnosing early A D using MRI In o r d e r to optimize the volumetric
m e t h o d we used a p r o g r a m developed in house to calculate the volumes 
m e a s u r e m e n t of the structures of interest as whole and thin slices optimally
oriented for mesial t e m p o r a l structures which we believe provides excellent
accuracy and reproducibility The use of stereology is a n o t h e r m e t h o d for
measuring volumes of specific structures by M R I Krishnan et al 1990 The
c o m p u t e d M R I volumetry however is m o r e accurate and reduces stages in
which variability can be introduced Kesslak et al 1991b 
We found a 38 decrease in the volume of the right and left hippocampus
in A D patients c o m p a r e d to control O u r main finding was the 92 accuracy
obtained in differentiating the A D group from the controls by discriminant
function analysis using the hippocampal frontal lobe and amygdaloid volumes T h e volumes of the hippocampi and the left frontal lobe were significantly smaller in the A D group c o m p a r e d to controls and those were the best
discriminators in the discriminant function analysis The diminished volumes
of the left hippocampus correlated with the decline of M M S E scores and
M P Laakso et al 
impaired verbal memory Impaired performance on the Trail Making test 
which is a test considered to assess frontal lobe functions was associated with
decreased volumes of the frontal lobes 
In a previous study the hippocampus measured from a single slice did not
differ in size between the early AD group and controls nod et al 1993 
In agreement with this Erkinjuntti and coworkers measured hippocampal
area at the level of the hippocampal head and were able to differentiate only
41 of the early AD group from the controls Erkinjuntti et al 1993 Thus 
measurements of the hippocampal area from one slice have not been as
successful in differentiating the AD group from controls as volumetric results 
which have yielded greater accuracy For example Seab and coworkers detected no overlap in hippocarnpal volumes among 10 early AD patients and 7
controls Seab et al 1988 Kesslak et ah found a reduction of 48 8 in the
hippocampal volume in the early AD group 8 compared to age matched
controls 7 Kesslak et ah 1991a In another study hippocampal volumes in
85 of 20 early AD patients fell below those of 22 controls Jack et al 1992 
Killiany and coworkers could correctly identify 100 of the controls and the
early AD group using a discriminant function analysis including a combination of volumes of hippocampus and temporal horn of the lateral ventricle
 Killiany et ah 1993 
In line with our findings an in vitro 7 T MR microscopy study of the
hippocampus in AD indicated that the cross sectional area of the hippocampus was decreased by 31 compared to the control group Huesgen et al 
1993 This atrophy was also highly correlated with tangle counts within the
hippocampus but not with plaque counts In addition a recent study using
stereological techniques to compare the regional pattern of neuronal cell loss
in the hippocampus showed that AD patients have 25 neuronal loss in the
hilus 68 loss in the region and 47 loss in the subiculum greater than
those found in normal aging West et al 1994 
Studies in non human primates have suggested that the hippocampus as
well as the adjacent neocortex are necessary for acquisition temporary storage and retrieval of explicit memory Zola Morgan et al 1982 In normal
subjects a study measuring regional cerebral blood flow using the 
method showed that the right hippocampal region is activated in association
with memory function Squire et ah 1992 In epileptic patients a focus in the
right hippocampus led to impairment on visual memory tests whereas left
hippocampal foci were associated with impairment on verbal memory tests
 Miller et al 1993 In agreement with earlier human data which have emphasized the importance of the hippocampus for associative memory our study
also showed a significant association between the shrinkage of the left hippocampus and impairment of verbal memory in AD patients 
Taken together previous studies and our results suggest that the volume
of the hippocampus is a sensitive measure of AD already in the early course
of the disease By measuring only the volume of the left hippocampus the AD
patients were separated from controls with a sensitivity of 78 and a specificity of 94 Hippocampal atrophy however is not specific nor exclusive to
AD The volume of hippocampus has been shown to decrease for example in
epilepsy schizophrenia and circumscribed amnesia Press et ah 1989 Jack et
MRI volumetry in Alzheimers disease
al 1990 Suddath et al 1990 Data on hippocampal volumes in patients with
other dementing disorders such as vascular dementia and Parkinson
dementia are not available However in many dementing illnesses the clinical symptoms and other changes on CT or MRI scans such as ischemic
lesions are useful diagnostic aids 
In the present study the volumes of the right amygdala 1 4 of control 
or the left amygdala 1 8 were not significantly reduced in AD patients 
This finding agrees with some Killiany et al 1993 but not all previous
studies Scott et al 1991 Pearlson et al 1992 Cudnod et al 1993 nod
et al measured volumes of amygdala in 11 patients with early AD and 6
controls and found a 43 5 difference in the volume of the amygdala with
only one overlap between the AD and the control group nod et al 1993 
Killiany et al did not detect any significant difference in the volumes of the
amygdala between 8 early AD patients and 7 controls Killiany et al 1993 
In another study the combined volumes of the left amygdala and the left
entorhinal cortex identified 67 of 15 patients with moderately severe AD
and 100 of 16 controls Only two levels of the amygdala were measured
 Pearlson et al 1992 In an autopsy study Scott et al found in patients with
advanced AD that the amygdalar nuclei showed significant atrophy except for
the paralaminar portion of basal nucleus compared to age matched controls 
The magnocellular regions of the amygdala showed proportionally greater
size reductions than other areas Scott et al 1991 
Even though there are detailed descriptions of MRI anatomy of amygdala
 Naidich et al 1987 Bronen and Cheung 1991b Jack et al 1992 Tien et al 
1992 the measurement of the amygdala has proved to be complicated In the
study of nod et al for example the interrater variability was 13 
 nod et al 1993 Separating the anterior amygdala and the amygdala
from uncus seem to be the most difficult task in the measurement and is
responsible for much of the variability in the measurements Davis et al 
1992 Jack et al 1992 Pearlson et al 1992 Tien et al 1992 nod et al 
1993 Killiany et al 1993 Our radiologists also agreed that the anterior
amygdala was the most difficult of the structures which they had to measure 
In spite of the more complicated anatomy and shape of the hippocampus it
was easier and could be measured more exactly than the amygdala Jack et al 
1992 Tien et al 1992 By using imaging planes oriented perpendicular to
the hippocampus together with proper imaging parametres heavily weighted fast spin echo sequence that maximize gray white matter contrast 
the entire hippocampus can be reliably measured Press et al 1989 Bronen
and Cheung 1991b Tien et al 1992 This view is also supported by our
better interrater reliability data for the hippocampus than for the amygdala 
In addition to the differences and difficulties in methodology the discrepancy
in volumes of the amygdala in distinct studies is probably due to differences in
the clinical severity of the AD patients studied 
The good results in separating the AD group and the controls in our study
suggest that such volumetric measurements might be useful in the diagnosis of
early AD The most efficient discriminating measures were the volumes of the
right and left hippocampus and the left frontal lobe Nonetheless 100 
accuracy in diagnosis remains elusive
