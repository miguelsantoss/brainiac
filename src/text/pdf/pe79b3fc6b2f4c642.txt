Article abstractObjective To test the hypothesis that MRI based measurements of hippocampal volume are related to
the risk of future conversion to Alzheimers disease AD in older patients with a mild cognitive impairment MCI 
Background Patients who develop AD pass through a transitional state which can be characterized as MCI In some
patients however MCI is a more benign condition which may not progress to AD or may do so slowly Patients Eighty
consecutive patients who met criteria for the diagnosis of MCI were recruited from the Mayo Clinic Alzheimers Disease
Center Alzheimers Disease Patient Registry Methods At entry into the study each patient received an MRI examination
of the head from which the volumes of both hippocampi were measured Patients were followed longitudinally with
approximately annual clinical cognitive assessments The primary endpoint was the crossover of individual MCI patients
to the clinical diagnosis of AD during longitudinal clinical follow up Results During the period of longitudinal observation which averaged 32 6 months 27 of the 80 MCI patients became demented Hippocampal atrophy at baseline was
associated with crossover from MCI to AD relative risk RR 0 69 p 5 0 015 When hippocampal volume was entered into
bivariate models using age postmenopausal estrogen replacement standard neuropsychological tests apolipoprotein E
 APOE genotype history of ischemic heart disease and hypertensionthe RRs were not substantially different from that
found univariately and the associations between hippocampal volume and crossover remained significant Conclusion In
older patients with MCI hippocampal atrophy determined by premorbid MRI based volume measurements is predictive of
subsequent conversion to AD 
NEUROLOGY 1999 52 13971403
For patients who develop AD the transition from a
normal cognitive state to clinically recognizable AD
occurs gradually over years 1 It is presumed that the
pathologic substrate of the cognitive decline that
characterizes AD follows a similar slowly progressive
course with gradual accumulation of degenerative
pathology of AD ongoing for years perhaps even decades before manifestation of unequivocal clinical
symptoms Memory impairment is usually the initial
manifestation of dementia in AD That the transition
from normal cognition to AD is gradual however 
presents clinicians with a common and difficult diagnostic problem Does evidence of a mild memory impairment in an older individual represent the
earliest manifestation of AD or more benign forgetfulness that may not progress to dementia? Clinical
criteria for the classification of patients with a mild
cognitive impairment MCI have been established 2
The rate at which MCI patients convert to AD is
substantially greater than that of the general older
population 2 5 and MCI patients are the subject of
several more recent treatment trials 
Structural and functional imaging findings are diagnostic markers of AD 9 Most imaging studies how 
ever have been cross sectional in nature and have
been designed to demonstrate differences between
older controls and patients who were already demented Prior studies addressing prediction of future
dementia have been done with relatively few patients with familial AD 10 with the oldest old 11 or
using subjective image assessment 12 We addressed
this issue by conducting imaging studies and then
longitudinally following up individuals who were at
increased risk of AD because of the diagnosis of MCI 
The imaging measurement evaluated was MRI based
volume measurements of the hippocampi We chose
this measurement because 1 medial temporal lobe limbic structures particularly the hippocampus play a
central role in memory function and are the site of
the earliest neurofibrillary pathology in 14 2 
memory impairment is the hallmark of early 
and 3 MRI detects subtle medial temporal lobe damage in AD 11 16 In this study we tested the hypothesis that premorbid MRI based hippocampal volume
measurements in patients with MCI were related to
the risk of subsequent conversion to AD We also
determined whether the predictive power of hippocampal volume measurements was independent of

Patients and methods Recruitment and evaluation of
subjects Eighty consecutive MCI patients were recruited
from the Mayo Clinic AD Center and AD Patient Registry
 ADC ADPR which are prospective longitudinal studies
of aging and dementia 20 Informed consent was obtained

the Mayo Institutional Review Board Study participants
were assigned to diagnostic group categories during ADC 
ADPR consensus committee meetings consisting of a geriatrician neurologists neuropsychologists psychometrists 
and nurses who had seen the patient Relevant diagnostic
categories were those of MCI and AD Criteria for the
diagnosis of MCI were the 3 1 memory complaint documented by the patient or collateral source 2 
normal general cognitive function as determined by measurements of general intellectual function and screening
instruments 3 normal activities of daily living as documented by history and record of independent 4

Ascertainment of endpoint The primary endpoint or
dependent variable in this study was the crossover of individual MCI patients to the AD category during longitudinal follow up Patients were enrolled throughout the study
period All study patients underwent clinical neuropsychological reevaluations at approximately 12 month intervals 
Twenty six patients had a single serial follow up assessment 13 had two follow up assessments and 41 had three
or more follow up assessments MCI patients who remained unchanged cognitively were characterized as NEUROLOGY 52 April 2 of 2 1999
ble and the mean follow up time for these patients was
33 5 6 17 9 months Patients who became demented all of
whom received the diagnosis of probable AD at that time 
were designated as crossover patients the mean follow up
time from enrollment to crossover for these patients was
30 8 6 17 3 months The diagnosis of dementia was made
according to DSM III R criteria 22 The diagnosis of probable AD was made according to NINCDS ADRDA criteria 1
An MRI examination of the brain was performed within
4 months of the initial clinical assessment in all patients 
These MRI studies were used in the diagnostic process
only to exclude treatable causes of cognitive impairment 
The hippocampal volume data were unknown to the consensus committee throughout the study 
MRI methods All imaging studies were conducted at
1 5 T Signa General Electric Medical Systems Milwaukee WI using a standardized imaging protocol 25 Measurements of intracranial volume were derived from a
 weighted sagittal sequence with 5 mm contiguous
sections Volume measurements of the hippocampi were
derived from a weighted three dimensional 3D volumetric spoiled gradient recalled echo sequence with 124
contiguous partitions 1 6 mm slice thickness a 22 cm 3
16 5 cm field of view 192 views and 45 flip angle 
All image processing steps in every patient were performed by the same research associate who was blinded to
all clinical information age sex clinical course to insure
that the volumetric data were unbiased Validation studies
have shown the intra rater test retest coefficient of variation of hippocampal volumetric measurements to be 1 9 
with this method 26 The 3D image data set of each patient
was realigned into an orientation perpendicular to the
principal axis of the left hippocampal formation The imaging data were then interpolated in plane to the equivalent
of a 512 3 512 matrix and magnified 23 The voxel size of
the fully processed image data was 0 316 The borders of the hippocampi were manually traced on the work
station screen for each image slice sequentially from posterior to anterior Typically 40 to 50 imaging slices were
measured for each hippocampus In plane hippocampal anatomic boundaries were defined to include the to 
sectors of the hippocampus proper the dentate gyrus and
the subiculum figure 1 25 The posterior boundary of the
hippocampus was determined by the oblique coronal ana 
tomic section on which the crura of the fornices were defined in full profile 
Intracranial volume was determined by tracing the
margin of the inner table of the skull on contiguous images
from the sagittal sequence 
Apolipoprotein E genotyping DNA was extracted from
peripheral leukocytes and amplified by PCR 27 PCR products were digested with HhaI and the fragments were
separated by electrophoresis on an 8 polyacrylamide nondenaturing gel The gel was then treated with ethidium
bromide for 30 minutes and DNA fragments were viewed
by ultraviolet illumination 
Assessment of clinical variables The presence or absence of hypertension and ischemic cardiac disease was
assessed by review of medical records Patients were recorded as being positive for hypertension if hypertension or
its treatment was identified at any point in time in the
medical record Patients were considered to have ischemic
heart disease if any of the following were identified angina
pectorus myocardial infarction coronary bypass surgery 
or coronary angioplasty The time of menopause and the
presence or absence of estrogen replacement therapy were
also extracted from the medical records 
Statistical methods The hippocampal volume measurements of each patient were normalized for interpatient
variation in head size by dividing hippocampal volume by
the total intracranial volume of that particular patient We
previously determined age and sex specific normal percentiles for normalized hippocampal volume in a group of 126
cognitively normal older controls using the MRI volumetric
method described 25 Age and sex specific normal percentiles for each of the 80 MCI patients were determined
using this normal value database Each percentile was
then converted to a W score The W score is the value from
a standard normal distribution corresponding to the observed percentile For example for a standard normal distribution the 50 5 and 2 5 percentiles are given by 0 
21 645 and 21 96 respectively Thus a patient with a
hippocampal volume adjusted for age and sex at the fifth
percentile in the normal value database would receive a W
score of 21 645 Similarly a patient at the 50th percentile
would receive a W score of 0 When this method of assigning W scores is applied to the normal older control patient
database the resulting W scores precisely follow a standard normal distribution W scores in other study populations including our MCI cohort can then be compared
directly to this standard distribution providing a framework for comparing hippocampal volume measurements
among individual patients appropriately corrected for age 
sex and head size 
In addition to hippocampal volume other predictor variables for crossover to AD that were evaluated included

 COWAT Estrogen replacement hypertension and ischemic heart disease were also modeled as potential predictor variables 33 In the APOE risk analysis patients
were stratified into those with genotypes known to increase the risk of AD 3 4 4 4 and those who were 
noncarriers 2 3 3 3 34 Six patients who were 4 were
excluded from the APOE risk analysis because the association between AD and 4 is unclear 
Although a direct comparison of the W scores of patients who did and those who did not crossover seems
natural the length of follow up varied among patients 
Direct comparisons between patients who crossed over versus those who did not were therefore analytically inappropriate To accommodate variable follow up periods 
life table methods were used to evaluate patient characteristics relating to crossover rather than discriminate function analyses or logistic regression Each predictor variable
was evaluated univariately Because of sample size limitations extensive multivariate modeling was not feasible 
The possibility of confounding between hippocampal W
score and other variables was assessed by fitting bivariate
models evaluating hippocampal W score with each of the
other predictor variables individually APOE status estrogen replacement hypertension and ischemic heart disease
were entered as dichotomous variables in all analyses All
tests were two sided Estimates of relative risk RR were
obtained using usual semiparametric Cox regression testing methods A nonparametric version of Cox regression
testing was used for hypothesis testing for quantitative
variables For these same reasons confidence intervals are
not reported for estimates of risk 
Tests of hypotheses for quantitative risk factors using
Cox regression testing are sensitive to departures from
normality in this case more accurate probability statements are obtained using logit rank tests 35 Because some
of the data were skewed with the degree of skew varying
among successive risk sets the logit rank test was used
both univariately and bivariately in hypothesis testing 35
The logit rank tests were implemented computationally by
treating the logit rank scores for each of the quantitative
variables in each risk set as time dependent covariates in
a Cox regression model 
Kaplan Meier survival curves showing the probability
of crossover for patients stratified by hippocampal W
scores into three groups W 0 0 W 22 5 W 22 5 
were used for display purposes only to illustrate the association between hippocampal volume and crossover to AD 
The W score W 0 was selected a priori This is a natural
cut point indicating values in patients that are equal or
greater than the mean value among controls The cutoff
point W 22 5 was selected post hoc to optimally display
the gradient of the RR of crossover associated with hippocampal atrophy A W score of 22 5 corresponds to approximately the 1 percentile more precisely the 0 6
percentile among controls These W score cut points were
used for display purposes only figure 2 table 1 All statistical analyses tables 2 and 3 were performed using hippocampal W score as a continuous variable 
Results Of the 80 patients who were classified as having MCI at entry into the study 3 died during the
follow up period 2 of these after they had converted to AD

was 21 24 6 1 24 corresponding to the 11 percentile of

than those without such a history although neither of
these associations were significant 
Separate bivariate analyses were performed with hippocampal volume together with each of the other predictor
variables see table 3 Hippocampal volume was significant in all models The RR ratios of hippocampal volume in
all bivariate models were similar to those observed univariately suggesting the independence of hippocampal volume as a risk factor for crossover relative to each of the
other predictor variables evaluated

ing hippocampal volumes that were at or above the mean
value expected for age and sex matched controls Thirteen
had hippocampal W scores 22 5 Fifty four had W scores
between 0 and 22 5 Patients in the three W score groups
were similar on most demographic clinical and cognitive
testing variables see table 1 During the period of observation 27 of the 80 MCI patients converted to AD Of the
13 MCI patients with hippocampal W scores 0 at baseline 2 converted to AD 19 of 54 with W scores between 0
and 22 5 crossed over and 6 of 13 with W scores 22 5
crossed over see figure 2 
Only hippocampal volume DRS FCSRT free recall and
age were statistically significant predictor variables in univariate analyses of the risk of crossover see table 2 The
interpretation of hippocampal W score result is that for
each one unit increase in the hippocampal W score i e 
less atrophy the RR for crossover declined by 31 The
risk of crossover declined with advancing decade of age 
Carriers of the APOE allele were 49 more likely to
cross over than noncarriers Patients with better scores on
the cognitive tests were less likely to cross over The one
exception was that of the COWAT with a RR of 1 01 and a
nonsignificant p value The association between estrogen
replacement and crossover was not significant p 5 0 864 
Patients with a history of hypertension were more likely to
cross over than those without and patients with a history
of cardiac ischemic disease were less likely to cross over
Discussion Based on life table analysis we estimate that 9 of MCI patients with hippocampal W
scores 0 at baseline will convert to AD within 3
years compared with 26 of those with hippocampal
W scores between 0 and 22 5 and 50 of those with
W scores 22 5 There is considerable controversy
whether all MCI patients will eventually progress to
AD or whether MCI represents a relatively stable
condition in some Our results indicate only that the
rate of conversion is greater in MCI patients with
smaller hippocampi and do not address the lifetime
risk of conversion 
Old age is an established risk factor for AD and in
a cross sectional prevalence study older age would
be expected to be associated with a greater prevalence of AD 36 This is not the case in a study such as
ours because the rate at which individuals with MCI
progress to AD does not necessarily accelerate with
age The 80 MCI patients in this cohort shared a
similar cognitive and demographic profile at study
entry see table 1 It is possible that because AD is a
clinically heterogeneous disorder patients with incipient AD who were younger may have had a more
rapidly progressing form than those who were
older 37
This work focused on the prediction of crossover
using hippocampal volume measurements The intent was not to conduct an exhaustive assessment of
possible neuropsychological testing instruments as
predictors of crossover but to test the hypothesis that
the predictive power of imaging studies is independent of other potential predictor variables such as
standardized neuropsychological tests 2 38 The MMSE
and DRS are measures of general cognitive function

whereas the AVLT WMS R LMII and FCSRT indices are tests of memory 28 32 The COWAT is a test of
verbal fluency measuring attention and language
skills 39 In bivariate analyses paired with hippocampal W score the associations with risk of crossover
were statistically significant for the DRS and FCSRT
free recall 
Other studies have found an association between
postmenopausal estrogen replacement and decreased
risk of developing AD 40 41 No significant association
between crossover and estrogen replacement was observed in the women of this MCI group however 
The nonsignificant p value p 5 0 067 observed for
hippocampal W score as a predictor of crossover
when paired with estrogen bivariately see table 3 
may simply be the result of reduced statistical power
when men were excluded from the analysis 
Polymorphisms of the APOE gene are a significant
risk factor for developing late onset AD 34 The allele confers both an increased risk of developing AD
and also lowers the mean age at onset in a dosedependent fashion whereas the allele is protective A trend was present in our data indicating that
the 4 or 4 4 genotypes conferred a 49 increased
RR see table 2 of crossover relative to an MCI patient with the 3 or 3 3 genotypes APOE genotype
does not influence the rate of clinical progression in
patients with established AD 42 We suspect however 
that if the follow up period were extended to increase
the number of crossover events APOE would
emerge as a significant risk factor for crossover In
an earlier study analyzing the risk of crossover as a
function of several known risk factors including age 
family history a variety of cognitive testing instruments and APOE genotype APOE emerged as

the most powerful predictor however imaging variables were not considered in that study 
Unlike genetic markers which are present at
birth imaging studies can only identify progression
of the disease itself This is true for both structural
imaging measures and functional measures such as
PET because imaging studies become abnormal only
when the disease process itself has produced deviation from normal cerebral function or anatomy 43 44
Ideally the imaging findings should represent markers of incipient disease Our data suggest that MRIbased volume measurements of the hippocampi
fulfill this criteria 
Our results generally agree with those of several
studies Fox et al 10 studied 7 patients in their 40s
and 50s who were members of a family with an amyloid precursor protein 717 Val Gla pedigree Hippocampal volume declined more rapidly in those who
April 2 of 2 1999 NEUROLOGY 52 1401
declined cognitively than in those who remained stable de Leon et al 12 used visual assessment of the
size of the perihippocampal CSF spaces on CT and
found individuals with atrophy were more likely to
progress to dementia As part of a study of the
oldest old Kaye et al 11 found that the temporal lobes
but not hippocampi were smaller in those who declined cognitively than in those who remained stable 
The unique aspect of our study was the combined use
of all the following features 1 a rigorous quantitative MRI based measurement 2 a fairly large longitudinal cohort n 5 80 3 MCI patients who are at
risk for typical sporadic AD and 4 patients whose
age was fairly typical for onset of AD rather than at
the extremes of the age spectrum 
There are several limitations to this study that
cannot be fully addressed at this time The criterion
used to determine the endpoint was the clinical diagnosis of AD At our center the clinical diagnosis of
probable AD is 81 accurate compared with the
pathologic diagnosis of definite AD Thus absolute
determination of the endpoint in this study can only
be ascertained in the future at autopsy Despite the
small sample size a significant relation between
premorbid hippocampal volume and crossover to AD
was demonstrated which illustrates both the
strength of the association and the clinical potential
of the technique Moreover this association was not
altered when evaluated in the context of a series of
bivariate analyses which included many known risk
factors for AD Additional studies with larger sample
sizes are needed however to more accurately delineate the rate at which risk of crossover increases
with increasing hippocampal atrophy and the possibility that the relation may be nonlinear and the role
of interactions with other predictor variables

Article abstractObjective To investigate the association between apathy and depression and specific cognitive deficits
in AD Background Apathy and depression are frequent behavioral disorders in patients with AD However the neuropsychological correlates of these disorders have rarely been examined Methods A comprehensive neuropsychological and
psychiatric evaluation was carried out in 72 patients with AD with apathy and depression 29 patients with AD with
apathy only 31 patients with AD with depression only and 52 patients with AD with neither apathy nor depression
 control group Results Patients with apathy had significantly lower scores on tests of verbal memory naming set
shifting and verbal fluency compared with patients without apathy The association of depression and apathy produced
significantly more severe deficits compared with apathy only on a test of abstract thinking Finally depression in the
absence of apathy was not associated with more severe cognitive impairments compared with the AD control group Conclusions Apathy but not depression is associated with significantly more severe frontal lobe related cognitive deficits in AD 
NEUROLOGY 1999 52 14031407
Apathy and depression are among the most prevalent behavioral disorders in patients with AD 1 2 In a
recent study that included 101 consecutive patients
with AD we found that 46 had clinically significant apathy 2 Our study also demonstrated several
significant correlates of apathy in AD such as more
severe impairments in activities of daily living more
severe extrapyramidal signs and a significantly
higher frequency of both major depression and dysthymia compared with nonapathetic patients with
AD Although we also demonstrated a significant association between apathy and memory deficits the
study was limited because it included only a small
sample of patients with AD with apathy only 
Thus for the current study we examined a separate consecutive series of 185 patients with probable
AD who were assessed with a comprehensive neuropsychological battery that included tests of verbal
and visual memory abstract reasoning auditory
attention set shifting verbal fluency visuospatial
reasoning verbal comprehension naming construc 
tional praxis and manual dexterity To examine the
influence of apathy and depression on cognitive functions our study had a 2 3 2 design and included
patients with AD with depression but no apathy 
apathy but no depression both apathy and depression and neither apathy nor depression 
Patients and methods Patients A consecutive series
of 233 patients who attended the dementia clinic of our
institute complaining of memory problems were screened
for participation in the study After neurologic and neuropsychological evaluation 35 patients met the State of California AD Diagnostic and Treatment Centers criteria for
vascular dementia 3 and 13 additional people had a normal
assessment Both groups were excluded from further evaluations Thus the final sample of our study included 133
patients who met National Institute of Neurological and
Communicative Disorders and StrokeAlzheimers Disease
and Related Disorders Association criteria for probable
AD 4 and 51 patients with memory deficits on the neuropsychological evaluation but no deficits in other cognitive
domains this group had a Clinical Dementia Rating CDR

of 0 5 5 which is classified as questionable dementia We
decided to include patients with a CDR of 0 5 because most
of these patients were reported to progress into stages of
definite dementia 6 Moreover the inclusion of patients
with mild cognitive impairment may protect against a floor
effect i e lack of between group differences due to a poor
performance across all cognitive tasks 
Psychiatric examination After informed consent a
psychiatrist blinded to the neuropsychological findings carried out a structured psychiatric evaluation using the following instruments 
Structured clinical interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental DisordersIV DSM IV The
structured clinical interview for DSM IV is a semistructured diagnostic interview assessing signs and symptoms
necessary for the major Axis I DSM IV diagnoses 7 The
interviews were carried out with the patients and at least
one first degree relative who knew them well Based on the
structured clinical interview for DSM IV responses DSM IV
diagnoses of major depression or dysthymia were made 
Hamilton Depression Scale The Hamilton Depression
Scale HAM D is a 17 item interviewer rated scale for
rating the severity of symptoms of depression 8 TheHAM D
was administered to the caregiver 
Overt Aggression Scale The Overt Aggression Scale
 OAS measures specific aspects of aggressive behavior
based on observable criteria 9 Aggressive behaviors are divided into four categories verbal aggression physical aggression against objects physical aggression against self 
and physical aggression against other people 
Dementia Psychosis Scale This is an 18 item scale
that quantifies the severity and types of delusions in demented patients at the time of the psychiatric evaluation 
This scale was rated by a psychiatrist with the patient and
at least one close relative or caretaker We have demonstrated the validity and reliability of this scale in AD 10
Apathy Scale This scale includes 14 items that are
scored by the patients relative or caretaker 11 12 Each question has four possible answers scored from 0 to 3 Thus 
the Apathy Scale scores range from 0 to 42 points and
higher scores indicate more severe apathy We have demonstrated the reliability and validity of the Apathy Scale
in AD 11
All instruments included in the psychiatric assessment
 except for the Apathy Scale which was developed by one
of the authors S E S  were translated from English into
Spanish and back translated by a certified translator with
the help of a bilingual neuropsychiatrist S E S 
Neuropsychological examination Each patient was assessed by a neuropsychologist blinded to psychiatric findings using the following test battery 
Mini Mental State Examination The 11 item MiniMental State Examination MMSE has been found to be
reliable and valid in assessing general cognitive functions
and serves as a cognitive screening instrument in patients
with dementia 13
Buschke Selective Reminding Test This test measures verbal learning and memory during a multiple trial
list learning task 14 The patient listens to a list of words 
and recalls as many words as possible Each subsequent
learning trial involves the presentation only of those words
that were not recalled on the immediately preceding trial 
1404 NEUROLOGY 52 April 2 of 2 1999
The outcome measure was the total number of words
recalled 
Benton Visual Retention Test This test assesses visual perception and nonverbal memory Patients are exposed to geometric designs for 10 seconds and are
immediately presented with a card containing the correct
design among three foils The patient is asked to select the
previously presented design There are 10 trials and the
number of correct responses is the outcome measure 15
Similarities This subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale provides a measure of abstract reasoning 16
Patients were instructed to state the similarity between
two words Responses were scored according to the standardized criteria as indicated in the manual 
Digit Span This subtest of the Wechsler Memory
Scale examines auditory attention and includes two parts 
Both consist of seven pairs of number sequences that the
examiner presents at the rate of one per second In the
first part Digits Forward the patient is asked simply to
repeat a string of numbers from two to eight numbers in
length exactly as it is given In the second part Digits
Backwards the patient is asked to recite the string of
numbers from two to eight numbers in length in reversed
order 17
Wisconsin Card Sorting Test This test measures the
ability to develop and apply new concepts and subsequently shift sets which requires the subjects to suppress
a previously correct learned response and learn a new
one 18 Assessment of the overall proficiency of the test was
judged by the number of categories achieved maximum
of six 
Controlled Oral Word Association Test This test examines access to semantic information under a time constraint 19 Patients were instructed to name as many words
beginning with the letter F as they could in 1 minute 
Peoples names and proper nouns were not permitted The
letters A and S were then presented successively with
1 minute allowed for each letter The score was the combined number of appropriate words produced in 3 minutes 
Ravens Progressive Matrices This test measures
visuospatial reasoning Patients are presented with a spatial pattern problem with one part removed and four pictured inserts of potential matches of which only one
contains the correct pattern 20 The patient has to select the
correct piece to match the original spatial patterns The
patterns become increasingly complex over trials The performance score is the number correctly identified 
Token Test This test measures verbal comprehension
of receptive language and response to commands in series
of increasing complexity 21
Boston Naming Test This test measures the ability to
retrieve the name of line drawings of common objects of
varying familiarity The ability to access semantic information is assessed and the number of correctly named
objects is the outcome measure 22
Block Design This test part of the Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale examines the presence of constructional executive and perceptual abilities Patients are
presented with red and white blocks and are asked to
construct replicas of printed designs Accuracy of production is the outcome measure 17 Time to completion was not
considered in the final score 
Purdue Pegboard Test This test assesses manipula

tive dexterity The apparatus consists of a board containing two parallel rows of 25 holes each and 50 metal pegs 
Patients are asked to take the pegs with the dominant
 e g right hand and place them as quickly as possible in
the right column of holes during a 30 second period The
same procedure is repeated with the nondominant hand 
and the score is the number of pins inserted in the time
period for each hand 23
Statistical analysis Statistical analysis was carried
out using means and SDs analysis of variance ANOVA 
and post hoc t tests Frequency distributions were calculated using chi square tests and a Yates correction for
expected cell sizes of less than 5 All p values are twotailed 
Results Demographic and psychiatric findings Our
sample was divided into groups with apathy or depression
based on the following diagnostic scheme patients meeting
the DSM IV criteria of either major depression or dysthymia were included in the depressed group whereas patients scoring more than 2 SD of the mean apathy scale

Discussion This study examined neuropsychological correlates of apathy in AD and there were several important findings First patients with AD with
apathy had significantly lower scores on tests of verbal memory naming set shifting and verbal fluency
than patients with AD without apathy Second the
copresentation of both depression and apathy did not
result in cognitive deficits greater than those for apathy alone except on a test of abstract thinking 
where patients with both apathy and depression had
significantly lower scores than patients with apathy
only Finally depression in the absence of apathy
was not associated with more severe cognitive impairments when depressed patients with AD are
compared with patients with AD with neither apathy
nor depression 
Before offering further commentary several limitations of our study should be pointed out First we
did not divide our sample of depressed patients with
AD into those with major and dysthymic depression 
and whether a specific type of depression was associated with more severe cognitive impairments could

not be examined However in a recent study we
could not find significant differences in cognitive
function between patients with AD with major depression dysthymia or no depression 1 Second our
study included patients with questionable dementia
 i e patients with memory deficits on cognitive testing who did not meet the full criteria for probable
AD and whether all these patients will eventually
meet the full criteria for AD is unknown However 
several studies demonstrated that most patients
with questionable dementia do progress to the phase
of overt dementia 6 Moreover in our study the proportion of patients with questionable dementia was
similar in all four groups and the inclusion of patients with mild cognitive impairments may have
protected from lack of significant between group differences due to a floor effect  Another limitation is
that we do not have neuropathologic confirmation of
our clinical diagnoses Thus whether our patients
with apathy had dementia with Lewy bodies which
was found to be significantly associated with more
severe frontal dysfunction than classic AD 24 cannot
be ruled out Finally we measured the severity of
depression with the HAM D which may potentially
include apathy related items However mean
HAM D scores for AD apathy only and AD control
groups were similar suggesting that HAM D scores
were not influenced by the severity of apathy 
In a study that examined the neuropsychological
correlates of apathy in patients with PD we found
that apathy with or without depression was associated with significantly more severe deficits on tasks
of verbal fluency and verbal memory 25 Similar to our
1406 NEUROLOGY 52 April 2 of 2 1999
current findings patients with both apathy and depression did not show more severe cognitive deficits
than patients with apathy only 25 We suggested that
apathy in PD may be akin to the concept of bradyphrenia which was defined by as a slowing
of cognitive processing associated with impairment
of concentration In a preliminary study of the cognitive correlates of apathy in a smaller sample of patients with AD apathy was significantly associated
with more severe memory deficits 2 The current
study assessed a larger sample of patients with AD 
and not only replicated the association between apathy and memory deficits but showed that patients
with AD with apathy with or without depression 
also had significantly more severe deficits on tasks of
naming verbal fluency and set shifting thus demonstrating a profile of cognitive deficits similar to
those we found previously in patients with PD with
apathy However apathy in AD may also correlate
with overall cognitive disability and future studies
should examine the specificity of the current findings 
Verbal fluency set shifting and abstract thinking
have all been considered cognitive abilities related to
frontal lobe functioning 27 Apathy has been attributed to disruption of corticosubcortical circuits involving the basal ganglia and the frontal lobes 2
 suggested that lesions to the dorsolateral frontal cortex anterior cingulate or globus pallidus may produce both apathy and deficits on
frontal loberelated tasks such as verbal fluency
and set shifting Several recent findings validate this
hypothesis first we demonstrated that patients with
stroke with apathetic behavior had a significantly
higher frequency of lesions involving the globus pallidus compared with patients with stroke without
apathy 11 Second in both AD and PD apathy was
significantly associated with relatively more severe
deficits on frontal loberelated tasks 25 Third we
found that apathy in AD was significantly associated
with more severe extrapyramidal signs compared
with patients with AD without apathy which further
suggests disruption of basal ganglia structures in
patients with AD with apathy 28
