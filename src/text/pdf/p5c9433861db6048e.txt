Objective Diffusion tensor imaging DTI for the assessment of fractional anisotropy FA and involving measurements of mean diffusivity MD and apparent diffusion coefficient ADC represents a novel MRI based noninvasive
technique that may delineate microstructural changes in cerebral white matter WM For example DTI may be used
for the diagnosis and differentiation of idiopathic normal pressure hydrocephalus iNPH from other neurodegenerative
diseases with similar imaging findings and clinical symptoms and signs The goal of the current study was to identify and
analyze recently published series on the use of DTI as a diagnostic tool Moreover the authors also explored the utility of
DTI in identifying patients with iNPH who could be managed by surgical intervention 
Methods The authors performed a literature search of the PubMed database by using any possible combinations of
the following terms Alzheimers disease  brain  cerebrospinal fluid  CSF  diffusion tensor imaging  DTI  hydrocephalus  idiopathic  magnetic resonance imaging  normal pressure  Parkinsons disease  and shunting  Moreover all reference lists from the retrieved articles were reviewed to identify any additional pertinent articles 
Results The literature search retrieved 19 studies in which DTI was used for the identification and differentiation of
iNPH from other neurodegenerative diseases The DTI protocols involved different approaches such as region of interest ROI methods tract based spatial statistics voxel based analysis and delta ADC analysis The most studied anatomical regions were the periventricular WM areas such as the internal capsule IC the corticospinal tract CST and
the corpus callosum CC Patients with iNPH had significantly higher MD in the periventricular WM areas of the CST
and the CC than had healthy controls In addition FA and ADCs were significantly higher in the CST of iNPH patients
than in any other patients with other neurodegenerative diseases Gait abnormalities of iNPH patients were statistically
significantly and negatively correlated with FA in the CST and the minor forceps Fractional anisotropy had a sensitivity
of 94 and a specificity of 80 for diagnosing iNPH Furthermore FA and MD values in the CST the IC the anterior
thalamic region the fornix and the hippocampus regions could help differentiate iNPH from Alzheimer or Parkinson disease Interestingly CSF drainage or ventriculoperitoneal shunting significantly modified FA and ADCs in iNPH patients
whose condition clinically responded to these maneuvers 
Conclusions Measurements of FA and MD significantly contribute to the detection of axonal loss and gliosis in the
periventricular WM areas in patients with iNPH Diffusion tensor imaging may also represent a valuable noninvasive
method for differentiating iNPH from other neurodegenerative diseases Moreover DTI can detect dynamic changes in
the WM tracts after lumbar drainage or shunting procedures and could help identify iNPH patients who may benefit from
surgical intervention

ormal pressure hydrocephalus NPH first described in 1965 by Salomon Hakim is defined as
a clinicopathological condition related to the overproduction or flow obstruction of CSF 13 39 The prevalence
of this disease is age related reaching 1 5 9 among
elderly individuals 21 26 It remains one of the most controversial neuropathological entities both in regards to
its diagnosis and its proper management Characteristically despite many recent advances in imaging methods 
most NPH cases still remain idiopathic Normal pressure
hydrocephalus is usually characterized as idiopathic although it can be secondarily present in several disorders
and conditions such as subarachnoid hemorrhage head
trauma and CNS tumors Patients with idiopathic NPH
 iNPH have enlarged ventricles but normal CSF pressure
seen at a diagnostic lumbar puncture 1 The most common
symptoms of iNPH are summarized in a clinical triad gait
disturbance dementia and urinary incontinence 58 However these symptoms are not pathognomonic and may
also be present in vascular dementia Alzheimer disease
 AD and Parkinson disease PD among many other less
common diseases The exact underlying pathophysiological mechanism of this disorder has remained ill defined 
and several theories supporting the combination of CSF
circulation disturbances along with other cerebrovascular
disorders have been proposed 1 21 28 36 41 58
The diagnosis of NPH is based on a patients clinical
status imaging findings and the natural history of the disease The imaging criteria for NPH are mainly ventricular
enlargement i e with an Evans index  0 3 lack of any
anatomical obstruction of the CSF circulation enlarged
temporal horns and a corpus callosum CC angle of
greater than 40 on brain CT or MRI scans 58 Other diagnostic methods are a radionuclide cisternogram showing delayed clearance i e of 4872 hours of the infused
radiotracer over the cerebral convexities a brain cine
MRI study revealing increased ventricular flow rate and
a SPECT scan indicating decreased periventricular perfusion 25 31 57
Recently several clinical investigators have employed
diffusion tensor imaging DTI techniques to detect and
quantify any WM alterations in patients with iNPH The
DTI data generally indicate the movements of water molecules inside the brain tissue The combination of 2D
diffusionweighted images with all diagonal elements in
a 3D diffusion model creates a high resolution MRI series which may identify even subtle structural changes
in the periventricular white matter WM Quantitative
measurements in these changes are enabled by fractional
anisotropy FA and apparent diffusion coefficient ADC 
methods which can be used to determine the structural
integrity of the brain tissue 4 Researchers have used 3 basic models to analyze DTI data region of interest ROI 
analysis tract specific analysis and voxel wise statistical
analysis The ROI analysis has the disadvantage of subjectivity The tract specific analysis is applied only to regions of the brain in which diffusion can be accurately
measured Voxel wise analysis is more useful in measuring WM changes since it can be performed on the whole
brain The iNPH associated axonal loss could explain the
observed decreased FA in the anterior frontal WM a find

ing that is also confirmed by proton MR spectroscopy and
magnetization transfer studies 19 35
In the current study we reviewed and analyzed the
literature data on the use of MRI based DTI in the differential diagnosis of iNPH from other neurodegenerative
diseases such as PD or AD with similar clinical symptoms and conventional MRI findings Moreover the potential prognostic role of DTI for outcomes among iNPH
patients undergoing surgical CSF shunt placement was
evaluated 
Methods
An extensive literature search in the PubMed database
was performed for the period of January 2010 to December 2015 The following terms were used in this search 
Alzheimers disease  brain  cerebrospinal fluid 
CSF  diffusion tensor imaging  DTI  hydrocephalus  idiopathic  magnetic resonance imaging  normal
pressure  Parkinsons disease  and shunting  in all
possible combinations The search was limited to articles
published in English and case reports were excluded 
All retrieved articles were separately reviewed by 2 of
the authors A F and I S In addition the reference lists
of all the retrieved articles were meticulously reviewed to
identify any additional pertinent articles In the review of
the articles identified particular attention was paid to the
study design its methodological characteristics the technical characteristics of the FA and DTI protocols used 
and the potential clinical significance of the DTI and FA
findings Of note we made every possible effort to identify any redundant data among the different articles 
Results
Our literature search identified 19 studies that are included in the current review Table 1 The retrieved studies were separated whenever possible into 3 groups 1 
studies attempting to define the FA and DTI characteristics in iNPH patients by comparison with the corresponding characteristics in age matched healthy study participants 2 studies examining the role of FA and DTI in the
accurate diagnosis of iNPH and particularly in differentiating iNPH from other neurodegenerative diseases with
similar signs and symptoms and 3 studies evaluating the
potential prognostic role of FA and DTI for iNPH patients
undergoing CSF drainage or surgical shunt placement 
In the following we detail the findings in these selected
studies

in which 12 DTI gradient directions were acquired The
authors compared FA and mean diffusivity MD between

I Siasios et al 
statistically significantly increased MD in the periventricular corticospinal tract CST and the CC Fractional
anisotropy was also significantly increased in the CST
among the iNPH patients although such increase was not
observed in the CC of these patients The authors reported
that the observed gait abnormalities among the patients
with iNPH were statistically significantly correlated with
the DTI results in the CST they noted a strong positive
correlation p  0 001 between MD and the number of
steps and walking duration 14 In addition FA in the CST
was weakly p 0 04 and negatively correlated with both
of these gait variables 
In addition Hattori et al used TBSS ROI and tractspecific analysis methods to assess FA in the CST in 20
patients with iNPH and in 20 age matched healthy controls 15 Fractional anisotropy in the CST showed no patterns specific to iNPH White matter abnormalities vary
in iNPH patients an observation that was also confirmed
by significantly decreased FA in the WM located in the
frontal and the parietal lobes and by significantly increased FA in the IC 15
Similarly Koyama et al used DTI metrics in 24 iNPH
patients and 21 healthy controls to generate FA brain maps
and determine TBSS to measure FA in selected ROIs the
CC posterior limb of the internal capsule IC and cerebral peduncles 29 Compared with the controls patients
with iNPH had significantly lower FA in the CC and significantly higher FA in the posterior limb of the IC The
authors also reported that gait abnormalities of the iNPH
patients were statistically significantly correlated with the
lower FA in the CC 29
In another study Koyama et al studying 10 patients
with iNPH and 10 age matched controls 30 used a computer automated method to generate FA brain maps adjusted to the standard stereotactic space The authors
focused on 2 ROIs the minor forceps and the CST In
both of these regions FA was decreased among the patients with iNPH but this decrease did not reach statistical significance Moreover the authors postulated that the
FA in the minor forceps was negatively correlated with
the clinical manifestations of iNPH such as urinary incontinence and gait disturbances 30 Similarly in a study
of 11 iNPH patients and 6 healthy controls Nakanishi et
al used tract specific analysis mean diffusional kurtosis
imaging DKI and DTI of the CST at the level of the
lateral ventricle and observed that DKI and axial diffusion kurtosis values were significantly lower in the iNPH
patients than in the controls 42 In contrast ADCs FA and
axial i e eigenvalues were significantly higher in the
patients with iNPH 
Recently Osawa and colleagues studying 6 iNPH
patients and 12 healthy controls used a new metric the
delta ADC which determines the changes in ADCs in the
brain during one cardiac cycle 45 Delta ADCs in the frontal temporal and occipital lobes were significantly higher
in the iNPH patients than in the control patients Although
ADCs were also significantly higher in the iNPH group
than the control group these differences were smaller
than those observed in the delta ADCs The authors also
reported that ADCs and delta ADCs were not significantly correlated with each other 45

DTI Characteristics in iNPH and Other Neurodegenerative
Diseases With Similar Signs and Symptoms
Daouk et al studied DTI patterns in WM in the region of the IC ventricular morphometry and CSF flow
in patients with iNPH or AD 7 The authors reported that
FA was statistically significantly correlated with the ventricular dimensions in the patients with iNPH p  0 001 
Spearmans rho 0 88 In the patients with AD CSF
aqueductal flow was statistically significantly correlated
with the ADC p  0 001 Spearmans rho 0 79 Although the authors noted abnormalities in the CSF flow in
both patient groups patients with iNPH appeared to have
different DTI patterns in the region of the IC which could
be a significant imaging finding that could differentiate
these 2 pathological entities 7
Hattori and colleagues investigated the differences in
DTI findings among 18 patients with iNPH 11 patients
with AD 11 patients with PD and dementia and 19
healthy controls 17 The authors used DTI of the CST to
measure FA and axial and radial eigenvalues with a tractspecific analysis Only FA and axial eigenvalues were
significantly higher in the iNPH group than in the other
3 groups p  0 001 The CST tractography in patients
with iNPH revealed a qualitative pattern that was different from the patterns in the other patient groups and this
difference was statistically significant p  0 001 The authors reported that the analysis of FA in the CST had 94 
sensitivity and 80 specificity in detecting iNPH 17
In a further study Hattori et al using tract specific
analysis performed DTI of the fornix in 22 patients with
iNPH 20 patients with AD and 20 healthy controls 16 In
addition the authors recorded the volume length and
mean cross sectional area of the fornix in the study participants The iNPH and AD groups had a significantly
smaller volume of the fornix and had significantly lower
FA and smaller cross sectional areas in this region than
the healthy controls Interestingly the fornix was significantly longer in iNPH patients than in the AD patients and
healthy controls 16
Hong et al performed DTI of the 3 main regions of the
hippocampus i e the head body and tail in 13 iNPH
patients 15 AD patients and 15 healthy controls 18 The
authors measured DTI variables in both hemispheres and
used the ROI selection technique They reported that the
tissue volume in the hippocampus did not significantly differ between the iNPH and AD groups Fractional anisotropy was lowest in the AD patients whereas MD was the
highest in these patients For the patients with iNPH the
FA and MD values were in between the 3 groups Healthy
controls had the highest FA and the lowest MD of the 3
groups investigated The authors also noted that ROI or
laterality of the hippocampus has insignificant influence
on FA and MD results 18
Ivkovic and coworkers employed a new DTI technique
based on 3T MRI sequences in 15 patients with possible
iNPH 25 patients with various disorders including AD 
PD or Lewy body dementia and 2 patients with both NPH
and AD 20 The authors used MD histograms to discriminate the brain and the ventricles from a theoretical third
compartment consisting mostly of partial volume voxels
and of voxels with high MD determined with a combina 
Diffusion tensor imaging in iNPH patients
tion of DTI and diffusion weighted imaging techniques 
The authors novel technique efficiently recognized and
distinguished the 3 pathological conditions with 86 sensitivity and 96 specificity respectively However the
specificity of this new method dropped to 88 when it
was used to discriminate patients with iNPH from those
with AD 20
Kanno et al used the DTI technique to determine MD
and FA from a voxel based statistical map to distinguish
iNPH in 20 patients from AD 20 patients and PD 20
patients 24 In the supratentorial WM areas the highest
MD and the lowest FA were observed in the patients with
iNPH The periventricular areas exhibited high MD while
the CC and subcortical areas had low FA in the patients
with iNPH In addition only the mean hemispherical FA
values were partially associated with the clinical severity of iNPH The authors also reported that the FA results
obtained from the anterior limb of the IC and from the
region under the left supplementary motor area were associated with more severed gait abnormalities in the patients
with iNPH Using the frontal assessment battery method 
an evaluation tool that evaluates the functionality of the
frontal lobes and reveals cognitive impairment in patients
with dementia 12 Kanno and coworkers also observed that
FA in the frontal and the parietal subcortical WM was
statistically significantly correlated with frontal lobe functionality in iNPH patients 24
Marumoto and others investigated FA in 5 different
brain regions in 10 iNPH patients 18 PD patients and 10
healthy controls 37 According to this study FA in the anterior thalamic radiation and the minor forceps was lower in
iNPH patients than in the PD patients Moreover FA in the
anterior thalamic radiation was statistically significantly
associated with gait disturbances in both patient groups 37
DTI Characteristics in iNPH Patients Undergoing CSF
Drainage or Shunt Placement
Demura et al determined FA and ADCs in several
WM regions in 36 patients with possible iNPH before and
24 hours after a CSF tap test 9 The patients were separated
into 2 groups those who had significant neurological improvement after the CSF tap test 17 patients and those
who had no improvement 19 patients A statistically significant decrease p  0 05 in ADCs was detected only for
the patients with neurological improvement In contrast a
significant increase p  0 05 in FA after the CSF tap test
was observed in both groups 9
Jurcoane et al studied 2 groups of patients with iNPH
after they had undergone CSF drainage via a spinal tap 
the first group comprised 12 patients whose gait significantly improved 3 days after the CSF drainage and the
second group consisted of 14 patients whose gait did not
improve 22 The authors performed DTI and magnetization transfer ratio MTR measurements in the CSTs after
the CSF drainage in both patient groups In addition the
DTI and MTR assessments were repeated in the patients
of the first group after undergoing ventriculoperitoneal
shunt placement As a reference the authors used the DTI
and MTR results in the superior longitudinal fasciculus
before and after CSF removal in the iNPH groups and
also from 10 age matched healthy controls The study
participants in the control group had statistically significantly lower p  0 001 axial diffusivity than the patients
in the 2 iNPH groups In addition the patients whose gait
had improved after CSF drainage had higher FA than the
healthy controls and both axial diffusivity and FA statistically significantly decreased after the shunt placement
in these patients The authors concluded that a reduction
in axial diffusivity of greater than 0 7 could accurately
discriminate with 82 sensitivity between those iNPH
patients who respond to CSF drainage and those who do
not The authors also postulated that when the axial diffusivity decrease reaches 1 it could accurately predict
with 87 5 sensitivity and 75 0 specificity which iNPH
patients would show overall clinical improvement after
shunt placement They also concluded that using only DTI
measurements before CSF drainage in their study could
not differentiate those responding to the drainage from
those who do not 22
Lenfeldt et al performed DTI in 18 iNPH patients before and 3 days after removal of 400 milliliters CSF via a
spinal tap and also in 10 healthy controls 34 The authors
reported that FA in the anterior frontal WM was significantly lower in the iNPH patients than in the controls In
addition the ADCs in the genu of the CC and the centrum
semiovale were elevated in the iNPH patients compared
with the ADCs in the healthy controls The authors also
noted that in all iNPH patients the ADCs did not change
after the CSF drainage 34
In a study of 24 patients with clinical and imaging
manifestations of iNPH and 14 healthy controls ReissZimmermann et al studied DTI changes in the patients
with iNPH after CSF drainage 46 Of note only 15 of the
patients were eventually included in the authors study
protocol All DTI measurements i e FA and mean parallel and radial diffusivities were performed before and
after within 636 hours lumbar drainage The results of
this study indicated that FA was higher in the subcortical
WM and the CC in patients with iNPH than in the controls In addition the increased radial diffusivity tended to
normalize after the CSF drainage 46
Kim et al employed DTI in 16 patients with iNPH
before surgery and also in 10 patients with AD 10 patients with subcortical vascular dementia and 20 healthy
controls 27 The imaging protocol was repeated in 9 iNPH
patients who had undergone CSF shunt placement The
authors reported that the presurgical iNPH group had the
highest FA of all groups in the posterior limb of the IC 
They also observed that FA significantly decreased after
the shunt placement Before the shunting the iNPH patients had MD values in the anterior periventricular WM 
the anterior limb of the IC and the superior longitudinal
fasciculus that were higher than in the patients with AD
and in the healthy controls but were lower than in the
patients with subcortical vascular dementia The authors
also reported that FA could diagnose iNPH with 87 5 
sensitivity and 95 0 specificity 27
Using a new 12 direction sequence acquisition with a
3T MRI unit Nicot et al investigated alterations in FA
and also in the ADC in the IC and the body of the CC in
10 iNPH patients after the patients had undergone a shunt
placement 43 The authors measurements obtained with a

conventional DTI protocol showed that only the ADCs in
the IC were significantly higher postoperatively In contrast the novel image acquisition technique indicated a
significant postoperative decrease in FA 
Discussion
Several hypotheses have been proposed for explaining
the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms of iNPH 
Most of these theories converge on the concept that ventricular enlargement stretches and compresses the periventricular WM and the adjacent CC leading to interstitial
edema and progressive axonal loss 2 3 11 32 38 48 55 Neuropathological findings in NPH are consistent with demyelination of the frontal lobes presence of microinfarctions 
organized thrombi or lacunas arteriole sclerosis of the
periventricular WM and leptomeningeal fibrosis 5 10 Compression or deformation of the CST due to the ventricular
enlargement results in frontal lobe dysfunction malfunction of the corticobasal ganglia thalamic circuit or both 
This malfunction greatly affects the supplementary motor
cortex resulting in the gait disturbances characteristic of
patients with NPH 33 40 44 47 Numerous similarities in pathogenesis between iNPH and AD or other subcortical vascular dementias have been reported 6 23 5254 Symptoms of
iNPH resemble those observed in disorders arising from
diseases of the frontal lobe 51 56 Biopsy samples taken at
the time of shunt placement in patients with iNPH have
shown the presence of AD type histological changes 
which may explain the lack of treatment responses after
shunt placements in these cases 8 49 50
Several researchers have underlined the significance
of DTI based methods for diagnosing iNPH 14 15 29 30 42 45 A
plethora of different DTI protocols for examining various
areas of the brain have been described in the literature 
including manual ROI placement TBSS tract specific 
voxel based and delta ADC analyses The most frequently studied regions in patients with iNPH are the periventricular WM areas such as the IC CST and CC as well as
the frontal temporal and occipital lobes and the cerebral
peduncles Patients with iNPH have significantly higher
MD in the CST and the CC than do healthy controls 14 In
addition most studies have reported significantly higher
FA in the CST among iNPH patients than among healthy
subjects 15 42 The only exception was the study by Koyama
et al which reported decreased FA values in the CST and
the minor forceps in iNPH patients 30 Significantly less
experience exists with the use of DKI for evaluating or
diagnosing iNPH It has been reported however that DKI
values in the CST are significantly decreased in iNPH
patients compared with those in healthy controls 42 The
delta ADC has also been used for examining patients with
suspected iNPH and it has been reported that delta ADCs
in the frontal temporal and occipital lobes are increased
in iNPH patients relative to the corresponding delta ADCs
in healthy controls 45 Furthermore several clinical investigators have reported that the gait abnormalities of iNPH
patients are statistically significantly correlated with increased FA in the CST and the minor forceps 14 30 37
A critical analysis of all published series employing
DTI with combined FA and MD measurements in CNS

areas such as the CST and the CC may help improve the
diagnosis of NPH Additionally FA and MD both seem
to correlate well with NPH symptoms particularly with
gait disturbance Thus the DTI method may be a useful
noninvasive diagnostic tool that not only can help diagnose NPH but may also assist in the grading of the clinical
severity and progression of NPH We note that the number
of published series on DTI for NPH diagnosis is still small
and that these studies had relatively low numbers of participants In addition some normal age related changes
in brain function and structure in these participants may
have also influenced the accuracy of this imaging method 
Despite these limiting factors the available data support
the inclusion of DTI in preoperative imaging assessments
during the examination of patients with suspected NPH 
In addition FA and MD may well be important for differentiating iNPH from other neurodegenerative diseases
such as AD and PD that frequently have overlapping clinical symptoms and signs 7 1618 20 27 37 It has been shown that
iNPH and AD patients have different DTI findings in the
IC 7 Moreover it also has been reported that the ventricular volume is positively correlated with FA in patients with
iNPH 7 Characteristically FA in various periventricular
areas in patients with iNPH statistically significantly differs from that in patients with PD or AD For example 
FA and axial eigenvalues in the CST were reported to be
significantly higher in patients with iNPH than in PD or
AD patients 17 Of note FA has a sensitivity of 94 and a
specificity of 80 for diagnosing iNPH 17 In addition FA
in the fornix is significantly lower in patients with iNPH
than in those with AD 16 Patients with iNPH have higher
FA in the hippocampus than do AD patients but lower FA
in the same region than healthy controls 18 Moreover MD
in the hippocampus in iNPH patients was reported to be
significantly lower than in AD patients but significantly
higher than in healthy controls 18 Similarly FA values in
the posterior limb of the IC and MD in the anterior limb
of the IC and in the superior longitudinal fasciculus are
significantly higher in patients with iNPH than in patients
with AD 27 Also iNPH patients have lower FA in the anterior thalamic radiation and the minor forceps than do PD
patients 37 The use of the MD histogram method appears
to have had a significant role in differentiating iNPH from
AD PD or Lewy body dementia 20 This MD method has
been reported to have 86 sensitivity and 96 specificity
in differentiating iNPH from the other neurodegenerative
diseases studied 20
Differentiating iNPH from other neurodegenerative
diseases represents a frequent and complex diagnostic
problem which can be addressed with the use of DTI
metrics Although previously published morphometric
changes in the fornix and the hippocampus appear to be
contradictory their evaluation along with DTI findings
may help clinicians differentiate iNPH from other neurodegenerative diseases Newer techniques for analyzing
MD and FA data may provide noninvasive tools for differential diagnosis with high specificity and sensitivity 
Again the limiting factors of a small numbers of series
and study sizes decrease the statistical significance of the
impact of these new imaging based methods on improved
iNPH diagnosis 
Diffusion tensor imaging in iNPH patients
Moreover the utility of DTI with FA and ADC techniques has been studied also in patients with iNPH before
and after CSF drainage via a spinal tap to identify imaging characteristics that could be used to predict which patients would most likely benefit from the drainage 9 22 27 34 
Some of these studies have reported that CSF drainage
significantly increases FA in the periventricular WM and
the CC and also significantly decreases ADC in these areas 9 46 The authors observed that elevated radial diffusivity in the subcortical WM returned to normal after CSF
drainage in iNPH patients with clinical improvement 9 46
These findings may have a predictive value in selecting
those patients whose NPH might respond to a CSF shunt
placement However 1 study reported that the DTI variables did not change after CSF drainage 34
In addition previous series have investigated the utility
of DTI also in patients undergoing CSF shunt procedures 
and all have noted that FA values in the CST and the IC decrease after shunt placement 22 27 43 Moreover shunt placement increases ADC 43 It has also been proposed that the
significant decrease in axial diffusivity after shunting may
have a predictive value for selecting patient with iNPH for
surgery 22 In light of these findings we emphasize the importance of adding DTI as a noninvasive diagnostic tool to
our armamentarium to identify iNPH patients who would
respond to a CSF shunt placement 
Conclusions
Although DTI is a relatively new imaging modality it
may take on a significant role in the diagnosis and differentiation of iNPH from other disorders and diseases with
similar imaging and clinical features The reported specificities and sensitivities of this noninvasive imaging method for detecting iNPH are high Moreover the use of DTI
could significantly contribute to the selection of iNPH patients for surgery potentially improving overall outcomes
for these patients and mitigating surgical failure rates 
However we wish to highlight significant drawbacks
to the wide clinical application of the DTI method First 
the existence of various technical protocols along with the
significant variation in the anatomical areas studied greatly decreases the reproducibility and diagnostic accuracy
of both FA and MD The use of these different techniques
and metrics makes a meaningful comparison of previously
published results practically impossible Second the normal range of the parameters measured needs to be defined
and most probably needs to be standardized for different
age groups This will require large scale multicenter studies and the adoption of a widely accepted imaging protocol for creating a database and for setting normal measurement ranges Despite these technical limitations and
weaknesses DTI lends itself to the examination of iNPH
patients and may well improve overall outcomes for these
patients
