Dementia one of the most feared associates of increasing longevity represents a pressing public health problem and major research priority Alzheimers disease
 AD is the most common form of dementia affecting
many millions around the world There is currently no
cure for AD but large numbers of novel compounds are
currently under development that have the potential to
modify the course of the disease and slow its progression There is a pressing need for imaging biomarkers to
improve understanding of the disease and to assess the
efcacy of these proposed treatments Structural magnetic resonance imaging MRI has already been shown
to be sensitive to presymptomatic disease 110 and
has the potential to provide such a biomarker For use
in large scale multicenter studies however standardized methods that produce stable results across scanners and over time are needed 
The Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
 ADNI study is a longitudinal multisite observational
study of elderly individuals with normal cognition mild
cognitive impairment MCI or AD 11 12 It is jointly
funded by the National Institutes of Health NIH and
industry via the Foundation for the NIH The study will
assess how well information alone or in combination 
obtained from MRI 18F udeoyglucose positron
emission tomography FDG PET urine serum and
cerebrospinal uid CSF biomarkers as well as clinical
and neuropsychometric assessments can measure disease progression in the three groups of elderly subjects
mentioned above At the 55 participating sites in North
America imaging clinical and biologic samples will be
collected at multiple time points in 200 elderly cognitively normal 400 MCI and 200 AD subjects All subjects will be scanned with 1 5 T MRI at each time point 
and half of these will also be scanned with FDG PET 
Subjects not assigned to the PET arm of the study will
be eligible for 3 T MRI scanning The goal is to acquire
both 1 5 T and 3 T MRI studies at multiple time points
in 25 of the subjects who do not undergo PET scanning  CSF collection at both baseline and 12
months is targeted for 50 of the subjects Sampling
varies by clinical group Healthy elderly controls will be
Jack Jr et al 
sampled at 0 6 12 24 and 36 months Subjects with
MCI will be sampled at 0 6 12 18 24 and 36 months 
AD subjects will be sampled at 0 6 12 and 24 months 
Major goals of the ADNI study are to link all of these
data at each time point and make this repository available to the general scientic community to develop
technical standards for imaging in longitudinal studies 
to determine the optimum methods for acquiring and
analyzing images to validate imaging and biomarker
data by correlating these with concurrent psychometric
and clinical assessments and to improve methods for
clinical trials in MCI and AD The ADNI study overall is
divided into cores with each core managing ADNI related activities within its sphere of expertise clinical 
informatics biostatistics biomarkers and imaging 
The purpose of this report is to describe the MRI methods and decision making process underlying the selection of the MRI protocol employed in the ADNI study 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The MRI portion of the ADNI study was divided into
three phases development preparation and execution
of the study itself In this report we outline activities of
the rst two phases Members of the MRI core established a basic set of requirements that guided the protocol development process The overarching principle
was to maximize scientic value while minimizing patient burden Specic guidelines were 
The MRI data acquired by ADNI must be consistent across sites and over time That is similar
image qualities contrast to noise spatial resolution resistance to artifact reliability speed etc 
must be achieved across sites and platforms over
time at each eld strength 
Based on responses to an initial questionnaire 
virtually all participating clinical enrollment sites
had access to at least one MRI scanner from GE
Healthcare Philips Medical Systems or Siemens
Medical Solutions Consequently scanners from
only these three vendors were supported A variety but not all of the MRI platforms from each
vendor were supported Specically some older
platforms e g Siemens Vision or GE Healthcare
systems running software earlier than 9 1 were
not supported 
Modication to an existing product pulse sequence on a particular vendor platform was encouraged but only if it was both practical and
would substantially benet the study 
The study emphasis was on brain morphometry 
hence the most important image set was the weighted 3D volumetric acquisition Isotropic
voxels were desired to avoid a directional bias 
but not required The target voxel size was approximately 1 with a maximum of 1 5 mm
in any one direction 
The whole brain must be covered without image
wrap Given the large number and variety of participating sites the imaging volume must be easy
for technologists to prescribe regardless of experience level 
The Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative
Acquisition time for any series should be less
than 10 minutes 
Artifact reduction is more important than reduction in acquisition time 
At 3 T the increased signal to noise ratio SNR 
compared with 1 5 T was used to increase spatial
resolution while increasing the receiver bandwidth to help compensate for the increased
chemical shift and the more rapid susceptibility
variation as measured in hertz at 3 T 
The 3D weighted protocol must operate successfully with major imaging analysis methods
that have been employed in this eld such as
manual and atlas based region of interest generation boundary shift integral voxel based morphometry and tensor based morphometry 
ADNI must include phantom based methods to
monitor scanner calibration across all sites over
the course of the study 
Post acquisition correction of certain image artifacts would be implemented where applicable 
such as 3D distortion correction for warping due
to gradient nonlinearity 
Several basic decisions about the composition of the
MRI protocol for the execution phase were made on the
basis of the cumulative experience of members of the
MRI core with multisite MRI based studies information
gleaned from surveys at the participating ADNI clinical
sites and the protocol guidelines established above 
Each subject will be enrolled in the study for a 3 year
period and multiple types of data will be collected at
each sampling point so we anticipate a high research
burden on each participant Moreover ADNI is an observational study which offers participants no experimental treatment In order to maximize scientic value
while minimizing patient burden the MRI core targeted
the duration of the patient scanning portion of the execution phase MRI protocol to approximately 30 minutes We also decided to scan the ADNI phantom immediately after each patient exam rather than
decoupling phantom and human scanning Site surveys revealed that the average time window allotted for
a single MRI examination of the head was approximately 45 minutes The overall structure of the ADNI
MRI execution phase was therefore targeted to be 30
minutes of patient scan time and 15 minutes of phantom scan time 
The protocol at a minimum had to include at least one
high quality high resolution 3D weighted sequence 
as well as a second acquisition that provided weighted information to ascertain brain pathology A
number of optional additional imaging sequences were
considered for the MRI protocol including MR spectroscopy diffusion tensor imaging arterial spin labeling 
and uid attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR sequences The MRI core decided to limit the scope of the
protocol to two domains high quality 3D weighted
morphometric information and a dual contrast proton
density weighted sequence for pathology detection 
This decision was based on balancing the various competing considerations outlined above Options for this
high quality 3D weighted sequence were magnetiza 
tion prepared rapid gradient echo MP RAGE and IRFSPGR which is a related technique available on the
GE scanners and spoiled gradient echo SPGR or
equivalent spoiled fast low angle shot FLASH for Siemens systems and fast eld echo FFE for Philips
systems We also considered an approach that had
been adopted by the Biomedical Informatics Research
Network BIRN study generating synthetic images
by acquiring stand alone SPGR or equivalent 3D volumetric data sets with high and low ip angles 13 14 
Development Phase
During the development phase a total of 29 sample
human studies with weighted 3D volumetric studies
at 1 5 and 3 T were obtained from various ADNI sites
and the MRI vendors Based on protocol features that
worked well across vendor platforms a set of generic
protocols was generated and then reviewed and revised
by the MRI core group along with industry and external
advisors until a consensus was reached The generic
protocols were adapted to yield vendor specic protocols for the preparatory phase study based on availability of software options Also minor protocol differences
were introduced at this stage due to vendor specic
implementation differences A customized MP RAGE
pulse sequence was developed for the GE platform to
minimize vendor to vendor differences At this stage we
also identied and implemented pulse sequence xes
required for the weighted IR pulse sequences on
some platforms including increased RF bandwidth of
the inversion pulse at 3 T and increased gradient area
for the end of sequence spoiler Note that these customization steps resulted in sequences that in some
cases were non product This in turn meant that ongoing support throughout the study by the MRI vendors
as systems were upgraded was required At the conclusion of the development phase vendor specic protocols that included the list of 3D weighted sequences
above where appropriate by vendor platform were created This protocol was then employed in the preparatory phase 
Preparatory Phase Study
The ADNI MRI preparatory phase consisted of a mini
clinical trial the purpose of which was to select the 3D
 weighted volume sequence that would be employed
in the execution phase of the main ADNI study for
morphometric assessment Two endpoints were evaluated rst the ability of the imaging sequence to appropriately differentiate normal control subjects from AD
subjects cross sectionally and second test retest precision on serial scan pairs obtained in normal elderly
control subjects i e a situation in which no systematic
biologic change is expected Six different sites representing the relevant MRI vendor platforms at 1 5 and 3
T participated in the ADNI MRI preparatory phase 
Over these six sites 73 normal elderly subjects and 64
AD subjects were scanned once for cross sectional
comparison purposes The control subjects were
scanned again 2 weeks later in order to evaluate precision Scanning sessions were performed on both
phased array receive and single channel T R birdcage
RF coils for some platforms The data acquired above
were submitted for quantitative evaluation using the
techniques that will be employed in the main ADNI data
analyses boundary shift integral voxel based morphometry tensor based morphometry atlas based
hippocampal volumetrics and also a measure of graywhite matter contrast to noise In addition scans were
graded qualitatively by a trained individual for artifacts
and general image quality on a four point scale none 
mild moderate and severe Each scan was graded on
several separate criteria blurring ghosting ow artifact intensity and homogeneity SNR susceptibility artifacts and gray white CSF contrast 
RESULTS
A total of 208 unique MRI studies in 137 subjects were
acquired during the preparatory phase Plans for analysis of this data as initially outlined were compromised
by the discovery of additional image imperfections on
some system platforms while the preparatory phase
was in progress These included inconsistent polarity of
the readout gradient between vendors that resulted in
undesirable cephalic shift of fat over the brain at the
base of the skull Fig 1 for sagittal acquisitions Also 
with transmit receive T R head coils the images were
unacceptably noisy Fig 2a which was corrected at
the expense of increased imaging time by increasing
the number of slices and the MP RAGE repetition time 
as indicated in Table 1 and illustrated in Fig 2 Finally 
some older systems imposed a 128 limit on the maximal
number of slices This not only degraded the SNR but
also precluded sufcient coverage Both the change in
chemical shift direction and the lifting of the 128 slice
limit required further pulse sequence modication The
protocol change to increase SNR for T R birdcage coils
and pulse sequence modication for chemical shift direction were made while the preparatory phase was in
progress resulting in undesirable discontinuities in
this data 
 Undesirable chemical shift The manufacturers default polarity of the readout gradient in the SI direction for
sagittal acquisitions shifted fat over the base of the brain
 arrow left in the rst version of the protocol This hinders
automated brain extraction algorithms Reversal of this shift
 right required custom alteration of the manufacturers product imaging sequence 
Jack Jr et al 
 Poor SNR with single channel birdcage coils in rst
version of protocol As indicated in Table 1 the protocol using
a single channel birdcage coil differs from the phased array
protocol Left When 1 5 T images are acquired using the
phased array protocol with a birdcage coil poor SNR results 
Right Making the parameter adjustments listed in Table 1
resolves the problem without increasing chemical shift 
The MRI core along with the external advisors met
during the 2004 annual ISMRM meeting in Miami The
purpose of this meeting was to review data from the
preparatory phase and select a nal protocol for the
execution phase of ADNI A general summary of the
qualitative ranking results from best to worst were 
MP RAGE  SPGR  synthetic The different scan
types were also graded on the basis of quantitative
measures made by the individual image analysis
groups in the MRI core These data have appeared or
will appear as separate independent publications 15 
Overall the results were mixed There was no clear
indication across the different analyses performed that
one image type outperformed the other In addition 
where one image type was found to be better than another differences were typically small There was an
overall consensus that the MP RAGE and SPGR or
equivalent sequences outperformed the synthetic 
images The primary advantages of the SPGR over MPRAGE were superior SNR and superior performance on
applications that placed a premium on brain CSF segmentation The advantages of the MP RAGE sequence
were superior gray white contrast to noise superior
performance in some applications requiring cortical
segmentation and imaging times that were under 10
minutes for all vendor platforms at both eld strengths 
The evaluation group also noted that the SNR advantage for SPGR was to a large extent present on birdcage
coil acquisitions at 1 5 T acquired with the initial unsatisfactory version of the preparatory phase MP RAGE
protocol which was acquired with birdcage coils The
protocol changes illustrated in Fig 2 resulted in a signicant improvement in the performance of MP RAGE
in the various image processing algorithms The evaluation group decided to extrapolate to what we would
have seen had the higher SNR protocol been used
throughout the entire preparatory phase when weighing the pros and cons of various MR sequences 
The evaluation group unanimously selected MPRAGE as the 3D sequence for the ADNI execution phase
 Fig 3 The suggestion was also made to acquire backto back MP RAGE sequences as opposed to the more
traditional approach of a single acquisition per exam

The advantage of incorporating back to back acquisitions as a standard feature of the protocol is that the
decision to repeat the scan on the basis of image quality
will not be placed in the hands of individual technologists at the sites performing the scans The ADNI MRI
quality control center at the Mayo Clinic will select the
better MP RAGE sequence at each time point based on
centralized and standardized criteria Perhaps most importantly requiring back to back MP RAGE scans
should reduce the number of examinations that must
be repeated due to poor image quality This in turn
should minimize patient burden and enhance patient
retention in the study Finally if both MP RAGE scans
are of equivalent high quality the magnitude images
could be combined typically after spatial registration of
the two image volumes to produce a single image with
an improvement in SNR approaching 2 
Discussion of the appropriate imaging sequence to
employ for cerebral pathology detection centered on
FLAIR vs dual contrast fast spin echo The 30 minutes
allotted to patient scan time could accommodate only
one of these additional sequences Although the FLAIR
sequence is highly useful it was decided that some
clinical groups would nd a double fast spin echo sequence more in keeping with their general practice than
a stand alone FLAIR image This was an important consideration because an on site interpretation of all ADNI
MRI studies by a local radiologist for medical alerts is a
feature of the overall ADNI study design The MR core
therefore decided on the following for the nal format of

DISCUSSION
The requirements for the ADNI MRI protocol differ from
those used to generate a routine clinical protocol For
example while an experienced radiologist often can
read through minor artifacts the automated software
programs used for the analysis typically cannot In fact 
as a general rule the more fully automated the analysis
algorithm is the less tolerant it is to image imperfections Therefore smaller elds of view that can lead to
wraparound artifacts e g the nose onto the back of the
head were avoided as well as parallel imaging methods
like sensitivity encoding SENSE that can sometimes
result in residual aliasing when there is imperfect calibration Also partial k space acquisition was avoided
because of the associated artifacts that can result in
regions of rapid susceptibility variation Consequently 
the acquisition time of the MP RAGE series is somewhat longer than a corresponding protocol typically
used for diagnostic purposes The ADNI MRI protocol
was selected in a data driven manner with considerable
deliberation by a group of experts in the eld of MRI 
Because of the large multicenter nature of ADNI MRI
techniques that were widely available in the 2004 2005
time frame were given preference although important
pulse sequence changes like the fat water chemical
shift direction were allowed The protocol follows a set
of principles outlined by the MRI core ADNI executive
committee and external advisory committee that are
 ADNI phantom The ADNI phantom is spherical 
with multiple inclusions that are used both for ducial purposes and for SNR and contrast measurements Image at the
bottom is an MRI illustrating the central SNR inclusion as well
as smaller spheres for ducial measurements 
 Effect of gradwarp Spherical phantom with rectilinear grid inclusion before left and after right gradwarp
correction 
meant to maximize scientic utility while minimizing
research burden for participants in ADNI 
In addition to imaging study subjects ADNI is also
acquiring images of a phantom in the same examination period as each human MRI exam Fig 4 The
phantom was specically designed for ADNI by a subset
of the ADNI MRI core along with partners in industry
 16 18 The ADNI phantom and accompanying analysis software will measure gradient calibration residual
nonlinearity after 3D distortion i e gradwarp correction SNR and contrast These measurements will
be used to monitor scanner performance over time for
each scanner involved in the ADNI study Tolerance
specications for each parameter will be established
when sufcient longitudinal data from all participating
sites have been acquired and analyzed These specications will be used to inform sites of any deviation from
tolerance limits detected on individual scanners In addition the gradient calibration measures acquired at
each imaging time point will be linked with its corresponding human scan This will permit retrospective
rescaling of human images to correct for drift or discontinuities in gradient calibration 
To enhance standardization across sites and platforms of images acquired in the ADNI study post acquisition correction of certain image artifacts has been
implemented These include corrections in image geometry for gradient nonlinearity i e 3D gradwarp 19 20 
corrections for intensity nonuniformity due to nonuniform receiver coil sensitivity 21 and correction of image intensity nonuniformity due to other causes such
as wave effects at 3 T These corrections are system
specic For example only systems with apparent gradient nonlinearity undergo this correction and the implementation of 3D gradwarp or equivalent is specic
for each gradient conguration Fig 5 Similarly correction for intensity inhomogeneity due to nonuniform
sensitivity of multiarray receiver coils was implemented
for those systems in which the manufacturer did not
provide this feature as a product at the inception of the
study Fig 6 In addition to the uncorrected original
image les the images with all the corrections and
some with intermediate steps will be available to the
general scientic community as described at http 
www loni ucla edu ADNI These data correction procedures as well as image quality control procedures are
performed at a single site Mayo Clinic Image data
quality control includes inspection of each incoming
image le for protocol compliance clinically signicant

 Intensity in homogeneity correction Phased array
coil acquisition at 1 5 T before left and after right intensity
nonuniformity correction Images have been reformatted from
the sagittal into the axial plane to illustrate the intensity inhomogeneity anteriority prior to correction 
medical abnormalities and image quality The results
of image quality control analysis are uploaded to the
ADNI central data base where this information is
linked to the relevant image le and is available to the
general scientic community The actual image processing analyses for ADNI are performed at ve separate sites 
The approach to standardization across sites and
platforms of the MRI protocol and acquisition parameters for each imaging sequence post acquisition correction of image artifacts and phantom based monitoring of the instruments themselves could be extended to
other multisite trials including those in other research
areas This approach will minimize variation in the data
collected due to technical nonuniformity and thus maximize across site sensitivity to true biologic variation In
large multisite studies where the role of MRI is to capture relevant phenotypic information in all study participants the importance of standardization supersedes the natural impulse by MR scientists to employ
the most cutting edge MR methods that usually will be
unique to each platform and can introduce undesirable
technical variability
