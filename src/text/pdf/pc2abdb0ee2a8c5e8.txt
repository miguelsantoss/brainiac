Results Compared with healthy controls patients with
PDD showed gray matter volume decreases in several of the
following regions bilateral putamen accumbens nuclei left
side of the thalamus bilateral hippocampus parahippocampal region and anterior cingulate gyrus Patients with PD
also showed gray matter reductions compared with healthy
controls in the right side of the hippocampus left anterior
cingulate gyrus and left superior temporal gyrus 
Conclusions The hippocampus thalamus and anterior
cingulate are the regions most affected in PDD Our results agree with recent neuropathological findings suggesting the involvement of the limbic and cortical areas in PD

ARKINSON DISEASE PD IS
among the most frequent
chronic neurodegenerative
diseases 1 The estimated
prevalence of PD with dementia PDD is approximately 30 2 and the risk
of dementia in patients with PD is almost 6
times higher than in the general elderly
population 3
The neuropathological basis responsible for the presence of PDD remains
controversial Degeneration in the subcortical structures notably the medial
part of the substantia the basal
ganglia amygdala and thalamus 5 
nucleus basalis of and locus
 have variously been implicated in PDD However recent studies
also emphasize the importance of cortical changes An association has been
observed between dementia and the
presence of cortical Lewy bodies 8 9 The
presence of Alzheimer type neuropathology in PD is another likely contributor to
dementia 10 11
Magnetic resonance imaging MRI allows in vivo identification of global and
regional atrophy Studies have shown PDD
 REPRINTED ARCH NEUROL VOL 62 FEB 2005
to be associated with volumetric changes
in the substantia inominata 12 the hippocampus 13 and total cerebral volume 14
Voxel based morphometry VBM allows the determination of brain density
and or volume changes without a priori region of interest selection 15 16 This technique has been used in degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease 17
dementia with Lewy bodies DLB 21 and
mild cognitive impairment 22 In PD it has
been used to determine the structures involved in the generation of parkinsonian
resting tremor 23
The aim of this study was to use VBM
to examine more closely the structural
brain changes responsible for PDD We 
therefore compared brain changes in patients with PDD in patients with PD without dementia and in healthy agematched control subjects

controls were recruited from the Parkinson Disease and Movement Disorders Unit Hospital Clinic Barcelona Spain during a 9 month period Table 1 The study was approved by
the local ethics committee Written informed consent was obtained from the patient or the patients caregiver 
DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND SELECTION
Idiopathic PD was diagnosed using the criteria of the Parkinsons Disease Society Brain Bank London England 25 All
patients had a good or an excellent initial response to
levodopa treatment Dementia was assessed using 3 standardized instruments the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition DSM IV 26 the Clinical Dementia Rating scale 27 and the Mini Mental State Examination 28
Subjects needed a Clinical Dementia Rating scale score of 1 a
Mini Mental State Examination score of less than 23 and both
DSM IV items to fulfill dementia criteria The Clinical Dementia Rating scale and DSM IV were administered by a trained
clinician J M or Francesc Valldeoriola MD and the MiniMental State Examination by an experienced neuropsychologist C S Where required for the Clinical Dementia Rating
scale collateral information was drawn from the patients
spouse or caregiver The control group was matched for sex
and age SD 5 years to the patient with PDD Three
patients were excluded owing to MRI movement artifacts 
Patients were clinically assessed using the Unified Parkinsons
Disease Rating Scale 29
MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in all subjects using a 1 5 T scanner GE Medical Systems Co Milwaukee Wis 
and the head coil A strict imaging protocol was used including a 3 dimensional inversion recovery preparation spoiled gradient recalled echo sequence of the entire brain in the axial plane 
and the following parameters repetition time 17 milliseconds echo time 5 milliseconds inversion time 300 milliseconds section thickness 1 5 mm field of view 24256 cm 
and number of excitations 1

VOXEL BASED MORPHOMETRY
The MRIs were analyzed using WDCN London or http 
 www fil ion ucl ac uk spm 30 All the automated image processing was done by a single masked investigator C S One
subject with PD was excluded from VBM analysis because visual inspection of the MRI revealed marked hypointensities consistent with basal ganglia calcifications 
All MRI processing was carried out in accord with the optimized VBM protocol 16 Briefly the processing steps outlined
by this protocol are 1 the creation of a customized anatomical
 weighted template and prior probability images separately for
each group by normalizing the brain images to the default SPM
 weighted template segmenting averaging and smoothing
the averaged brains in each group 2 normalization of the structural brain images in each group using these customized templates segmenting and cleaning the original weighted images normalizing the brain images to the customized templates 
segmentation and cleaning of normalized brain images and modulation of gray matter images by the determinant of the Jacobian
matrix derived from the spatial normalization step This procedure has been previously described in detail 16
Differences in gray matter were examined using analysis of
variance with post hoc comparisons controlspatients with
PD controlspatients with PDD patients with PDpatients
with PDD Statistical thresholds were corrected for the 3 post
hoc comparisons used here using the comparepopulations 1 scan per subject Exclusive masking was used
to determine which voxel differences were specific to one disease process Results were thresholded for the group being
studied at P 001 uncorrected for multiple comparisons 
Only those clusters exceeding a size of 10 voxels were
included in the analysis 
Owing to the characteristics of our acquisition protocol and
head size differences among subjects the most superior and or
inferior regions were absent in some subjects or not clearly visible after reorientation Therefore we restricted the volumetric analysis to a region of interest comprising the temporal lobes 
caudate lentiform nuclei cingulate gyrus anterior cingulate 
thalami insula extranuclear region amygdala hippocampi and
parahippocampus gyri This was achieved by means of the Wake

Hippocampal atrophy has been consistently described
as a feature in dementia In our study VBM results showed
a bilateral hippocampal reduction in patients with PDD 
which was more pronounced in the right hemisphere Previous studies have observed hippocampal degeneration in
PD 13 32 Hippocampal reductions may be due to both Lewy
body and Alzheimer type changes 10 33 34
We also found a relationship between reduction of the
left side of the thalamus and dementia The thalamus has
also recently been identified as a major target for neuropathological inclusions such as Lewy bodies in patients with PD 35 and an earlier study of neuropathology
and dementia in PD also identified volumetric loss in the
thalamus as a predictor of dementia 5 Because in our study 
the patients with PDD had greater motor impairment than
patients with PD it is possible that tissue loss observed
in the thalamus and putamen may reflect motor as well
as cognitive impairment in PDD 
Analysis of cortical regions with VBM showed a marked
volume decrease in the anterior cingulate in patients with
PDD compared with controls The anterior cingulate has
been shown to be particularly vulnerable to Lewy body
inclusions in 36 and DLB 36 Volumetric reduction
of the anterior cingulate may be involved in the attentional deficits described in PDD 37
We also found extensive volumetric reduction in the
parahippocampal gyrus In DLB cases with wellformed visual hallucinations exhibited high densities of
Lewy bodies in the amygdala and parahippocampus 38 Several subjects with dementia in our sample had a history
of visual hallucinations 
Patients with PD but without dementia also differed
from controls in the hippocampus and anterior cingulate although reductions were less marked than for patients with PDD Further the comparison between patients with PDD and patients with PD revealed differences
in the right side of the hippocampus and the left superior temporal regions Together these results suggest that
there may be a gradient of neuropathology affecting cingulate and medial temporal lobe structures in parkinsonism Consistent with this idea postmortem studies
have demonstrated that all patients with PD have some
degree of cortical Lewy body pathology 32
Our study has the limitations implicit to VBM procedures One should be cautious when using automated image processing packages for investigations in degenerative diseases because the software was not specifically
designed to measure atrophy 39 We attempted to solve
this problem by creating a local template comprising both
patients with PDD patients with PD and controls Also 
our sample was exclusive to patients from a clinical population and may not be representative of patients with PD
and patients with PDD in the wider community We also
used criteria for enrollment in the PDD group that excluded patients with questionable or early onset dementia and that focused on memory impairment rather than
visuospatial or attentional deficits Our results may thus 
pertain more to patients in the more advanced stages of
dementia and further studies with patients exhibiting a
spectrum of dementia severity may be required to establish whether MRI is a useful technique for differential diagnosis of PDD 
 REPRINTED ARCH NEUROL VOL 62 FEB 2005
CONCLUSIONS
Voxel based morphometric methods were used to examine structural brain changes in PDD gray matter loss
at both cortical and subcortical sites was observed Results revealed volumetric reductions in thalamic hippocampal and anterior cingulate regions corroborating previous neuropathological findings in PDD
