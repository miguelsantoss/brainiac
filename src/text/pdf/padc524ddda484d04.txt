Abstract Patients with Parkinsons disease PD may have
hippocampal atrophy compared with controls We compared
hippocampal and extra hippocampal volumes between PD 
PDD patients with PD who have mild cognitive impairment or
dementia Alzheimers disease AD and controls using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging MRI Participants 10
patients with PD 10 with PDD 11 with AD and 12 control
subjects had an informant interview neurological examination and psychometric testing Established reliable methods
were used to measure the hippocampus parahippocampal gyrus temporal frontal and parieto occipital lobes Correction
for intracranial volume was carried out before comparison 
There was no age difference between groups mean age 74
years On the Clinical Dementia Rating scale CDR cognitive
impairment was mild CDR  0 5 in the majority of PDD and
AD patients Hippocampal P  0 0004 volumes were smaller
in the patient groups Effect sizes compared with the control

Key words Parkinsons disease dementia Alzheimers disease MRI hippocampus atrophy
Patients with Parkinsons disease PD the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder are at high
risk for the development of dementia Incidence rates for
dementia range from 4 2 to 9 5 per year 1 2 The prevalence of dementia in PD ranges from 10 to 30 Thus 
PD with dementia may represent the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimers disease AD 
Dementia in PD is associated with a high risk of nursing
home and death 4 Early intervention in PD
patients who are at risk for dementia would be ideal but
accurate diagnosis and prediction is necessary 
Prediction of dementia is imperfect Incidence studies
have identied risk factors which include older age 
male gender longer duration of symptoms specic aspects of cognitive dysfunction e g decreased verbal
uency 5 6 and axial motor impairment which responds
poorly to dopaminergic treatment 7 A structural or functional neuroimaging marker might complement other
clinical and neuropsychological predictors 
Two previous studies demonstrated that hippocampal atrophy is evident in PD with or without dementia 8 9 Similar ndings are observed in dementia with
Lewy bodies DLB where diffuse Lewy bodies and 
in many cases the pathologic features of AD cooccur 10 12 These changes overlap with those seen in
PD with dementia PDD 13 14 but DLB is distinguished by overlapping onset of dementia and parkinsonism within 12 months along with hallucinations
and uctuations 15 Except for uctuations none of the
core features are distinctive for DLB Visual hallucinations for example are common in PD especially in

patients with coexistent dementia highlighting the
clinical overlap of DLB and PDD 16 18
We sought to conrm that hippocampal atrophy was
evident in an independent sample of patients with PD
with very mild cognitive impairment or dementia compared with healthy elderly and non demented PD using
whole brain volumetric imaging Specically we examined hippocampal and extrahippocampal regions to discern if the pattern of atrophy differed between PD and
AD Based on previous work we hypothesized that hippocampal atrophy would be present at an early stage in
older patients with PD but would be of lesser severity
than that seen in AD Furthermore we predicted that the
pattern of atrophy would differ between PDD and AD 
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Subjects
Subjects were recruited from the Parkinson Center of
Oregon Movement Disorders Clinic the Oregon Aging
and Alzheimer Disease Clinic and the Oregon Brain
Aging Study 19 Parkinsons disease was dened by the
presence of two signs among resting tremor rigidity and
bradykinesia consistent with the UK Brain Bank criteria 20 Parkinsons disease with dementia patients required a diagnosis of PD to have preceded the diagnosis
of dementia or cognitive impairment by at least one year 
This information was collected by history obtained from
an informant and was used to operationally exclude
DLB cases where dementia and parkinsonism occurred
within one year 14
Dementia was dened according to DSM IV criteria 21
Cognitive impairment was staged using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale CDR 22 which has been used previously in staging dementia in PD 23 A rating of 0 5 termed
questionable or very mild dementia indicates persistent
memory impairment or mild cognitive or functional
change representing a change from a previous level of
function and was the minimal criterion for cognitive impairment Some patients at this stage may not meet strict
criteria for dementia in that functional decline was not
required for the present study Nevertheless all cognitively
impaired and demented PD patients were referred to as
PDD Higher stages on the CDR represent more severe
dementia 1 mild dementia 2 moderate dementia 3 severe dementia Those with AD met criteria for probable AD
according to the NINCDS ADRDA 24
Methods used for the Oregon Brain Aging Study a
longitudinal study of healthy aging have been described
previously 25 All patients and controls underwent an interview with an informant that was used to provide
information to diagnose dementia and obtain a CDR
staging Cognitive testing was used as supportive evidence for cognitive impairment All non demented PD
patients and controls had no persistent cognitive or functional complaints or cognitive problems reported by the
patient or the informant 
BehavioralCognitive Assessment
Twenty PD patients had cognitive and motor assessments Three additional PD patients were recruited and
assessed but the scans could not be analyzed for technical reasons Their data was not included in this report 
Baseline cognitive abilities were characterized by the
Wide Range Achievement TestReading version 2
 26 The Mini Mental State Examination
 MMSE was carried out with all subjects 27 Depression
was assessed in the PD patients and controls using the
Geriatric Depression Scale GDS 28 Behavioral problems were documented using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory NPI 29 Cognitive assessments carried out for
the PD patients included the CERAD word list recall and
recognition test 30
Controls and patients with AD were assessed as described previously and were age gender and dementia
severity CDR matched to the PD subject from a pool of
available MRI scans Cognitive tests reported represent
those administered to subjects in all groups 
Motor Assessment
Standard clinical assessments were used to rate
tremor bradykinesia rigidity gait and balance 31 The
Unied Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale UPDRS was
used to rate PD patients who entered the study This was
only available for the PD patients None of the control
subjects and AD patients exhibited parkinsonism
clinically 
MR Imaging
MRI scans were obtained on a 1 5 Tesla GE scanner 
with the following image parameters multi echo multiplanar 4 mm coronal slices 24 FOV 256  256
matrix NEX  0 5 TR  3000 msec TE  30 and 80
msec as described previously 32 Image analysis was carried out by semiautomated recursive segmentation using
the program REGION and by manual tracing using NIH
Image v 1 5 on Macintosh computers Total pixel counts
for each region were summed for each slice and multiplied by the slice thickness to convert areas to volumes 
Hippocampal and parahippocampal volumes were measured by manually tracing the hippocampal areas on
serial slices located between the red nucleus and the
superior colliculus as described previously 32 Intracranial
 suparatentorial volume was dened as non bone pixels

group differences were not related to the statistically
insignicant increased number of males in the cognitively intact PD group analyses were repeated after
excluding that group Right and left hemisphere volumes
were combined for all between group comparisons because we did not hypothesize that one side would be
more likely to be associated with cognitive impairment 
moreover right and left hippocampal volumes did not
differ from each other t  0 61 P  0 55 Correlation
between memory and MMSE scores and left and right
hippocampal volumes were examined among the patients
with PD to determine if cognitive function might be
associated specically with focal hippocampal atrophy
and to test the hypothesis that verbal memory would be
associated with left and not right hippocampal atrophy 
Post hoc ANCOVA comparing directly the AD and PDD
was carried out after adjusting for MMSE to determine
if dementia severity might account for any trend in
parahippocampal volumes observed Effect sizes were
calculated for each of the patient groups by subtracting
the mean brain volume in the disease group from the
mean volume in the control group and then dividing by
the overall standard deviation A P value of 0 05 was
used for as the threshold for statistical signicance 
RESULTS
Data regarding the baseline characteristics of the subjects are presented in Table 1 Groups were matched for
age and education Although there were more men in the
PD without cognitive impairment there was no statisti

DISCUSSION
Our data conrm that PD patients with or without
cognitive impairment have more hippocampal atrophy
than healthy age matched control subjects with volumes
similar to that in patients with mild AD Differences in
parahippocampal volumes were of borderline signicance and trends observed were related to dementia
severity Differences in temporal and frontal lobe volume
and parieto occipital lobes were not signicant in this
sample Thus hippocampal atrophy is evident in older
PD patients before the onset of dementia Effect sizes
observed were modest for all comparisons with a trend
FIG 1 Box plot showing hippocampal hip and parahippocampal
 para volumes in cubic millimeters Parkinsons disease subjects without PD and with cognitive impairment PDD showed smaller hippocampal volumes Parahippocampal volumes did not differ between

for hippocampal atrophy of AD  PDD  PD compared
with controls 
We have extended previous research by examining a
mild spectrum of disease using quantitative whole brain
neuroimaging Previous pathological 36 39 and imagingbased volumetric 9 that have examined more
advanced patients with PD are consistent with our study 
Hippocampal atrophy also occurs in DLB which overlaps pathologically with PDD where hippocampal volume is intermediate between that observed in controls
and in those with AD with sparing of the parahippocampal gyrus 40
Our study was limited by a small sample size and by
the fact that the non demented PD group was predominantly male Nevertheless the difference in gender distribution between groups was not signicant statistically
and the other patient groups including the PDD group 
were well matched A larger intracranial volume in men
would bias against our nding of a decreased hippocampal volume in PD compared with controls arguing that
this nding is valid A greater number of men in the
cognitively intact PD group would bias toward nding
larger volumes in that group however we have adjusted
for intracranial capacity using accepted methods and the
overall MANOVA remained signicant after excluding
that group Although we had a small sample size our
current subjects were independent of those reported in
our pilot study that showed similar ndings and therefore are conrmatory 8 Based on our pilot study we
included a number of PD patients similar to those of
Laakso and associates 9
In DLB the rate of brain atrophy does not differ from
that in AD or vascular dementia 41 In a comparison with
controls and patients with progressive supranuclear
palsy patients with PD on average 5 years younger than
those in our study did not show hippocampal atrophy 
raising the possibility that atrophy is accelerated in PD 42
A recent study demonstrated that cognitive decline was
PD AND HIPPOCAMPAL ATROPHY
correlated with global brain atrophy in PD 43 A previous
volumetric study of patients with PD suggested that
hippocampal atrophy might be correlated with episodic
memory consistent with our nding of a relationship
between cognitive function and left hippocampal volume 44 Given the high risk of dementia in people with
PD and the nding that atrophy precedes the onset of
dementia our study raises the possibility that focal atrophy might provide a presymptomatic marker for dementia risk Nevertheless given that atrophy in both cognitively impaired and unimpaired subjects was similar 
additional changes must be invoked to explain dementia
in PD 
One interpretation of the trend to larger parahippocampal volumes in PDD is that the PDD subjects were
at a milder stage of disease Given that after adjustment
for MMSE there was no clearly signicant difference in
parahippocampal volumes between the AD and PDD
groups it is likely that dementia severity accounts for
this nding On the other hand the PDD and AD groups
did not differ in the distribution of CDR levels or on the
MMSE both of which reect global cognitive function 
Although sparing of parahippocampal and temporal lobe
structures also has been noted in DLB compared with
AD in imaging studies 45 46 a recent pathological study
found that parahippocampal involvement with Lewy
body and neuritic pathology was associated with dementia in patients with PD and DLB consistent with involvement of these regions in PDD 14 Involvement of the
subiculum was shown recently for DLB but not PD 
suggesting that the pattern of atrophy might differ in
these two entities 47
Our data examining cortical regions including parieto occipital lobe volumes are consistent with a recent
study that showed specic sparing of occipital volume in
DLB compared with AD and controls 48 In our study as
in many of the previous imaging studies there was
considerable overlap between patient groups with respect
to each of the brain volumes examined see Fig 1 
Given our small sample size we did not carry out subgroup analyses to examine the possibility of clinical
heterogeneity 
In summary we have shown that hippocampal atrophy
may distinguish PD from healthy controls Hippocampal
changes resemble those seen in patients with mild AD
and may correlate with cognitive function Prospective
studies will determine if this provides a presymptomatic
marker for dementia in PD and if the evolution of atrophy in PD resembles that seen in other neurodegenerative disorders Ongoing research using higher resolution
MRI scans will allow further more precise denition of
the pattern of brain atrophy especially in the medial
temporal lobes Pathological correlation with atrophy on
MRI will be required to determine if PDD is distinct
from DLB
