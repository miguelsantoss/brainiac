ABSTRACT
Objective This was a longitudinal single center cohort study to comprehensively explore multimodal progression markers for Parkinson disease PD in patients with recently diagnosed PD
 n 5 123 and age matched neurologically healthy controls HC n 5 106 
Methods Thirty tests at baseline and after 24 months covered nonmotor symptoms NMS cognitive function and REM sleep behavior disorder RBD by polysomnography PSG voxel based
morphometry VBM of the brain by MRI and CSF markers Linear mixed effect models were used
to estimate differences of rates of change and to provide standardized effect sizes d with 95 
confidence intervals CI 
Results A composite panel of 10 informative markers was identified Significant relative worsening PD vs HC was seen with the following markers the Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale I
 d 0 39 CI 0 090 70 the Autonomic Scale for Outcomes in Parkinsons Disease d 0 25 CI
0 060 46 the Epworth Sleepiness Scale d 0 47 CI 0 240 71 the RBD Screening Questionnaire d 0 44 CI 0 250 64 and RBD by PSG d 0 37 CI 0 190 55 as well as VBM units of
cortical gray matter d 20 2 CI 20 3 to 20 09 and hippocampus d 20 15 CI 20 27 to 20 03 
Markers with a relative improvement included the Nonmotor Symptom Severity Scale d 20 19 CI
20 36 to 20 02 and 2 depression scales Beck Depression Inventory d 20 18 CI 20 36 to 0 
Montgomery sberg Depression Rating Scale d 20 26 CI 20 47 to 20 04 Unexpectedly cognitive measures and select laboratory markers were not significantly changed in PD vs HC participants 
Conclusions Current CSF biomarkers and cognitive scales do not represent useful progression
markers However sleep and imaging measures and to some extent NMS assessed using adequate scales may be more informative markers to quantify progression Neurology

One of the great challenges in Parkinson disease PD therapeutics is the definition of clinically
meaningful endpoints that measure progression or lack thereof 1 To date numerous clinical
trials with putative neuroprotective agents have yielded negative results 24 It remains unclear
whether trial design or the agent tested or both are the reasons for past failures 
Currently several parameters are typically selected as endpoints for use in symptomatic and
neuroprotective treatment trials e g the Unified Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale UPDRS 
quality of life measurements 5 or the need for levodopa therapy 2

Reports of selective longitudinal investigations of nonmotor signs NMS 68 neuroimaging and laboratory have been
previously published as potential markers of
progression 10 These investigations were
largely conducted in smaller cohorts and
focused on single symptoms measures and frequently relied on more advanced PD cases 
and lacked age matched healthy controls 
The de novo Parkinson DeNoPa cohort
represents a prospective longitudinal singlecenter observational study of participants
with de novo PD and matched neurologically
healthy controls HC The studys aim is to
improve early diagnosis and to assess proper
progression markers scored at baseline with
biannual follow up 11
We hypothesized that a composite panel of
multimodal progression markers covering
overall NMS cognitive measures sleep imaging and CSF indices would be instructive in
understanding the natural history of early
PD and to thereby delineate specific and sensitive outcome measures for future intervention trials To this end we applied the same
panel of tests to a group of HC to separate
PD changes from the process of normal aging 
METHODS Study participants Longitudinal data were collected at baseline BL and at 24 months follow up 24FU 
Detailed inclusion criteria have been described and
are summarized in appendix on the Neurology Web site at
Neurology org 
After BL assessments all patients started dopaminergic therapy according to accepted with stable medication
until the 24FU visit The levodopa equivalent dosage LED at
24FU was determined as described 13 The clinical diagnosis was
reassessed in the on state for all patients at 24FU by consensus of
2 teams of independent neurologists C T F S D and B M J 
E for details see appendix 
Standard protocol approvals registrations and patient
consents We received approval from the ethical standards committee on human experimentation Landesrztekammer Frankfurt for all experiments using human participants Written
informed consent was obtained from all study participants consent for research 
Procedures Protocols data collection and data sample storage
have been described previously 11 Briefly our approach is of an
exploratory nature We examined longitudinal assessments using
validated and published tools NMS were the most relevant diagnostic tests in and were also investigated longitudinally
by means of the Movement Disorder Society MDS UPDRS
part I 14 the NMS Questionnaire the Nonmotor Symptom Scale
 NMSS and the Autonomic Scale for Outcomes in Parkinsons
Disease Scopa AUT The PD Questionnaire which has been
the primary endpoint in randomized studies 5 was used together
with assessment of depression by the self reported Beck
Depression Inventory BDI and the Montgomery sberg
Depression Rating Scale MADRS Cognition was tested with
the Mini Mental State Examination MMSE the Montreal
Cognitive Assessment Test MoCA and the Clock Drawing
Test Further tests for different cognitive domains are given in
appendix Sleep was assessed using the Parkinsons Disease
Sleep Scale the Epworth Sleepiness Scale ESS and the REM
Sleep Behavior Disorder RBD Screening Questionnaire RBDSQ In addition we performed video supported polysomnography
 PSG to classify RBD Voxel based morphometry VBM of gray
matter and hippocampus by 1 5T volumetric MRI was included
because significant atrophy has been described in correlation with
PD progression and cognitive decline 15 We also investigated serum
urate 16 We tested known CSF markers that have been previously
discussed as potential diagnostic markers of PD state or its
progression including total a synuclein a syn b amyloid 1 
total and phosphorylated tau protein t tau and p tau as well as
neurofilament light chain proteins 17 See appendix for
experimental details 
Statistical analysis We used linear mixed effect models to
identify differences in the rates of change in selected markers
between PD and controls For each marker we estimated a
random intercept model including group PD vs HC time BL vs
24FU and their interaction as predictors Models were estimated
using restricted maximum likelihood estimation taking into
account all available data points at BL and 24FU Differential
change in PD is apparent in a significant group multiplied by the
time interaction We present model based effect sizes for
differential change standardized by the observed SD in the PD
group at baseline 18 Significance testing was based on 95 
confidence intervals using parametric bootstrap with 2 000 resamples 
In addition we explored whether changes in individual markers
were influenced by selected BL characteristics To this end we conducted robust multiple regression analyses in the PD sample predicting 24FU scores of individual markers while controlling for
respective BL scores from LED and dopamine agonists at 24FU
and selected sociodemographic and clinical factors at BL Robust
regression was used to deal with non normality e g outliers in
the distribution of markers 19 All analyses were carried out with
the statistical platform R 20 using the package for linear mixed
models and robustbase for robust regressions 
We did not correct for multiple testing since our approach
was of an exploratory nature see also the Discussion and appendix 21 However marker candidates were chosen according to
their clinical relevance and following a review of the literature 
RESULTS Of the 269 recruited participants 254
 94 underwent follow up assessments 147 PD and
107 HC Four patients and 2 controls died before
24FU Reassessment of the clinical working diagnosis
led to the identification of a distinct neurologic
disorder in 24 16 patients shown in figure 
The reassessment of our previously described panel of
diagnostic in the remaining 123 patients
with PD and 106 HC at BL remained significant

We identified 68 55 tremor dominant 14 11 intermediate and 41 33 postural instability and gait disorder subtypes in our patients 
which we used as surrogate markers for PD and its
progression Ten of the 30 markers showed statistically significant rates of change relative to HC over

Clinical measures Nonmotor symptoms significantly
worsened in PD vs HC as assessed by the MDSUPDRS I score table 2 and figure 1A The
worsening of autonomic features relative to controls
was reflected by a statistically significant increase in the
Scopa AUT scores table 2 and figure 1D This
increase was mainly driven by an increase in
cardiovascular items of the Scopa AUT data not
shown In contrast the severity score for NMS by
NMSS showed improvement in relation to controls

of RBD at BL indicated worse cognitive decline on
MoCA The LED as another surrogate marker for
clinical severity was significantly associated with

DISCUSSION We performed a 2 year follow up
investigation on clinical measures and biomarkers
through clinical and technical assessment including
PSG MRI and serum CSF measures in the largest
single center cohort of 123 clinically diagnosed
early PD participants and 106 matched healthy
controls Overall we found that 20 of 30 tests
showed no statistically significant and no specific
progression in our DeNoPa patients The remaining
10 markers showed statistically significant changes
reflecting either progression in PD or change due to
treatment or both when compared to controls these
encompassed increasing sleep disturbances and
worsening of NMS whereas NMS severity NMSS 
and depression by MADRS and BDI improved

significantly decreased over the 2 year period 
Clinical measures Several smaller 7 10 and one
longitudinal have previously suggested the use
of NMS as candidate progression markers NMS
worsened in PD as measured by the MDS UPDRS I
in DeNoPa while the severity of NMS measured by
NMSS improved in our cohort Autonomic dysfunction as assessed by Scopa AUT also showed
statistically significant worsening in PD compared to
HC The only systematic longitudinal investigation on
NMS showed an increase in NMS domains after
24FU but NMS severity and more specific
autonomic features had not been addressed Also 
these patients were at different stages of disease and
the majority had received symptomatic treatment
already at BL 8 While the NMS tools cover various
Neurology 87
NMS the MDS UPDRS I captures a few key
symptoms Both the NMSS and MDS UPDRS I
show strong convergent validity 23 The discrepancy of
performance of self reported vs investigator reported
NMS in DeNoPa could also be the result of different
sensitivity of scales and questionnaires and points
towards the need for an improved and widely
standardized assessment of NMS for longitudinal
investigations 
We recorded an improvement of depression in our
patients with PD on 2 independent scales and individual differences in improvement were not significantly associated with dopaminergic dosage The
improvement of depression and quality of life in the
early honeymoon phase of PD generally considered
to represent the first 510 years after diagnosis is
in accordance with other studies 8 and is also related
to dopamine agonists 24
Following analysis of various domains of cognition 
we identified clear differences in cognitive performance
in PD compared to controls see table 2 PD baseline
differences but only cross sectionally and not with
any significant change longitudinally Most previous
longitudinal studies did not include control groups 25
Therefore previous studies in PD may have overinterpreted normal cognitive aging and we have thus corrected this deficit in our study design 
RBD and reduced subjective quality of sleep are recognized inherent symptoms during prodromal and fully
developed motor PD 26 Daytime sleepiness progressively
worsens in PD confirming that it may be dependent on
dopaminergic or an intrinsic factor of disease
progression RBD may be a useful marker to monitor
progression of PD either with PSG or with a similar
effect size by a 10 item self rating questionnaire RBDSQ The presence of RBD indicates worse cognitive
decline by MoCA as has been shown previously 28
Technical investigations To date DeNoPa comprises
the largest collection and interrogation of longitudinal data of PSG MRI volumetry and CSF markers 
Our MRI structural measures showed significant
overall and hippocampal gray matter volume loss in
PD The hippocampal region was selected since according to the Braak staging scheme 29 a syn pathology is expected to emerge there before affecting the
neocortex and hippocampal involvement has been
suggested in PD dementia 30 However effect sizes
were similar in both measures and correlations with
changes in cognitive markers were nonsignificant in
this early PD cohort data not shown 
A longitudinal CSF study found increasing tau
and tau levels 9 but significantly decreasing
CSF a syn levels in PD 31 In our study none of the
CSF markers or their ratios that were tested reached
statistical significance for progression Different

who consented to serial lumbar puncture 37 at
24FU A similarly small annual rate of change in CSF
markers has also been observed in patients with established Alzheimer disease AD The stability of our
markers in this early stage of motor PD could result
from a slowing of the neurodegeneration process in
the symptomatic phase similar to that seen in AD 32
This underlines the need for more specific progression
marker candidates for the early phase of the disease 
which will emerge from this and other ongoing studies 33
We explored many obvious candidates in a large
cohort of PD participants and looked for progression
markers for future use in clinical trial cohorts and
tried to exclude noninformative ones The fact that
we identified no more than 33 of the markers analyzed having significantly changed during our 24month observational period highlights the mandate
of finding reliable progression markers These results
have immediate consequences for clinical research in
PD by restricting the potential usage of some
markers and will take more time to eventually change
the clinical care delivered to patients with PD 
There are limitations of clinical practiceled
exploratory studies such as ours which merit discussion First DeNoPa is a real life observational survey
study Therefore we symptomatically treated patients motor symptoms The effects of dopaminergic
treatment on NMS vary depending up on the underlying mechanisms i e a symptom influenced by
dopaminergic deficit may respond positively to dopaminergic treatment such as depression and NMS 24
whereas a non dopamine responsive symptom may
worsen with such treatment such as daytime sleepiness especially in the early titration phase further
discussion can be found in appendix 27 Therefore we cannot remove any influence conferred by
therapy on our investigational markers but purposefully included 8 markers that are likely independent
of any introduced symptomatic therapy 34 such as
MRI volumetry and blood and CSF markers 
Second most of our proposed marker candidates
showed promising results as early diagnostic markers 
which does not necessarily qualify them as progression markers Further marker candidates specific for
progression of the disease need to be explored Third 
we did not control for multiple testing Although this
is an appropriate exploratory strategy for detecting
true changes in patients with PD i e reducing type
II errors it may lead to false positive findings However the detection of 10 significant changes among
30 tested is clearly more than would be expected by
chance alone thus corroborating the significance of
our results as a whole 35
The use of our proposed panel of outcome measures needs further validation before being used to rate
progression across centers One limitation is the
responsiveness of depression and some NMS to therapy 36 requiring new elaborated NMS scales This
should be undertaken independently by multicenter
cohorts enrolling larger numbers of participants this
is currently underway 33
Future studies need to investigate the validity of
these proposed markers standardize the assessment
of nonmotor features and identify more sensitive
and disease specific marker candidates that reflect
underlying biological processes such as propagation

of a syn pathology inflammation and neuronal

will be used as clinically meaningful endpoints of
progression that are essential in the development of
treatments for PD

MACRA Changes How Neurologists Are Paid
What Is MACRA and Why Is It Necessary?
The Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act of 2015MACRAreplaced the
Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate formula for calculating physician payments The rapidly rising
costs of health care in the US are unsustainable Changes in the health care system are essential and
must happen now 
How Will MACRA Affect Physician Payment?
Our health care system is moving from fee for service payments to a wider array of value based
payment models that put the patient at the center of care by calling for the improvement of the
quality safety and overall experience of patient care while demonstrating cost effectiveness by
providing care that is less expensive and delivers similar or improved clinical outcomes
