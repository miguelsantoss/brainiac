Abstract
Background Alzheimers disease AD is the most common cause of dementia in the elderly The possibility of
disease modifying strategies has evoked a need for early and accurate diagnosis To improve the accuracy of the
clinical diagnosis of AD biomarkers like cerebrospinal fluid CSF and neuroimaging techniques like magnetic
resonance imaging MRI and positron emission tomography PET have been incorporated into the diagnostic
guidelines of AD 
Case presentation In this case report we outline in reference to one of our patients with presenile dementia the
current approaches to the diagnosis of AD The patient was a 59 year old woman presenting with progressive
memory decline CSF A42 was normal while P tau was slightly increased FDG PET indicated a pattern typical for
AD amyloid PET showed an extensive global amyloid load and tau PET depicted a pronounced hippocampal tracer
accumulation The MRI scan was rated as normal at routine diagnostics however quantitative volumetric analysis
revealed significant atrophy especially of the parietal lobe The combination of biomarkers and neuroimaging
techniques was therefore suggestive of an underlying AD pathology 
Conclusions To enable early and accurate diagnosis of AD and thereby also patient recruitment for anti tau or
anti  amyloid therapeutic trials a combination of biomarkers and neuroimaging techniques seems useful

Background
Alzheimers disease AD is the most common cause of
dementia and is estimated to affect 106 8 million people
worldwide by the year 2050 1 It is clinically characterized by progressive memory and language impairment 
functional and behavioural disturbances and visuospatial
deficits 2 A definite diagnosis of AD still relies on postmortem histopathological detection of intracellular neurofibrillary tangles and extracellular amyloid plaques 3 It
is widely acknowledged that histopathological changes
start years before clinical manifestation of the disease 4 
As first disease modifying therapies are approaching early
and accurate diagnosis of AD becomes increasingly
important 5 Therefore the National Institute on Aging
and the Alzheimers Association have revised the criteria
for the diagnosis of AD 6 To assess the probability of an

underlying AD pathology biomarkers of the disease and
neuroimaging techniques have been incorporated into the
diagnostic guidelines of AD Here we present an exemplary case of presenile dementia based on which we
discuss the approaches to the diagnosis of AD 
Case presentation
A 59 year old retired attorney with 18 years of education presented with a three year history of progressive
memory decline For about one year she hadnt been
able to do the shopping or the cooking No behavioural
changes language impairment severe fluctuations of
attention and alertness recurrent visual hallucinations
or history of repetitive brain trauma were reported 
Family history was positive her mother as well as an
uncle had developed late onset dementia 
The Mini Mental State Examination which had been
performed three years ago because of subjective memory
impairment had been rated as normal For neuropsychological testing we applied the CERAD plus battery

additionally including Trail Making Test A and B as well
as verbal fluency tests The scores of almost all domains
of the CERAD plus battery were at least 1 37 standard
deviations below the age and education adjusted norm
values She scored 24 out of 30 points in the MiniMental State Examination Naming Boston Naming test 
was intact whereas phonemic verbal fluency was slightly
 11 words in 1 min and semantic fluency 9 words in
1 min was highly reduced Memory was highly impaired 
She displayed intrusions and showed a reduced performance of word list recall and recognition Constructional
practice was impaired as well Results of the Trail Making
Test showed reduced visual attention as well as reduced
speed of processing Cognitive flexibility measured by
Trail Making Test B was also poor 
At first presentation the neurological examination was
normal In particular no manifest or latent paresis and no
sensory deficit could be detected Deep tendon reflexes
were mildly hypoactive without any pathological reflexes 
Cranial nerves were also intact There was no evidence of
extrapyramidal features 
Laboratory tests for metabolic causes of dementia for
example for vitamin thyroid liver and renal function 
thiamine level and folate were within the normal range 
P tau 66 pg ml N  61 pg ml in cerebrospinal fluid CSF 
was only slightly increased whereas total Tau 293 pg ml 
N  500 pg ml and A42 1171 pg ml N  500 pg ml were
normal All other CSF parameters were within the normal
range 
The MRI scan which had been performed three years
ago as well as the MRI scan at first presentation were
interpreted as normal at visual inspection Especially no
sign of global or regional atrophy could be detected However atlas based volumetric MRI analysis 7 8 showed a
significant reduction especially of temporal and parietal
lobe volumes Z scores for the hippocampal and parietal
volumes compared to healthy controls were 2 9 and 4 2
respectively Fig 1 
Moreover a quantitative analysis based on voxel wise
z score analysis of patient grey matter segments and grey
matter segments from an age and sex matched control
sample after bias correction and spatial normalization in a
common standard space following an established method
9 showed a slight asymmetry with more pronounced
atrophy of rightsided parietotemporal cortical areas voxel
based grey matter reduction z  1 96 Fig 2 It has to be
noted that for the quantitative analysis data of the comparison group came from another MRI scanner than the
scan of the patient Acquisition parameters were harmonized between scanners to accommodate possible scanner
effects 
Fluorodeoxyglucose PET FDG PET showed an asymmetric reduction of brain glucose metabolism of parietal
and temporal cortical areas with a more pronounced

compared to healthy controls were 2 9 and 4 2 respectively

Alzheimers disease and outside the 95 confidence region of
healthy controls and was therefore automatically assigned to the
Alzheimers disease group
reduction of glucose metabolism in the right hemisphere 
In addition glucose metabolism of the posterior cingulate
cortex was significantly reduced Fig 2 
The patient underwent a florbetaben PET FBB PET 
scan which showed extensive FBB retention that was
greater in parietotemporal frontal and posterior cingulate precuneus cortex and less pronounced in the occipital
cortex Basal ganglia were also slightly affected Fig 3 
The tau PET scan with on the other hand
showed high tracer retention in both hippocampi as well
as moderately increased tracer retention in parietotemporal cortical areas There was no elevated tracer retention in other cortical areas Fig 3 
Conclusions
As our patient presented with a three year history of
cognitive decline that interfered with activities of daily
living and scored low in almost all domains of the CERAD
plus battery a clinical diagnosis of AD was made 6 
Because of the presenile age at onset and the positive
family history a monogenic form of AD might be possible 
Genetic testing could have excluded conditions mimicking
sporadic AD like dementia Our patient however refused
genetic testing Sensitivity and specificity of the clinical
diagnosis of AD compared to post mortem histopathological diagnosis ranges from 70 9 to 87 3 and from 44 3
to 70 8 respectively 10 The combination of biomarkers
and neuroimaging techniques was suggestive of an underlying AD pathology In absence of a neuropathological

confirmation of AD pathology a definite diagnosis of AD 
however was not possible The most important alternative
diagnosis in a case of presenile dementia are dementia with
Lewy bodies DLB frontotemporal dementia with memory
impairment FTD and chronic traumatic encephalopathy
 CTE As our patient had no pronounced variation in
attention and alertness reported no recurrent visual hallucinations and displayed no features of parkinsonism the
core features of DLB were not fulfilled 11 Furthermore
no progressive deterioration of personality or social comportment was reported and there was no evidence of
progressive language impairment Therefore there was no
clinical evidence for behavioural variant frontotemporal
dementia 12 or primary progressive aphasia 13 As there
was no history of recurrent impacts to the head or body 
CTE seemed unlikely as well 14 Table 1 summarizes
biomarker and neuroimaging findings in autopsy confirmed
cases of DLB FTD and CTE References in Table 1 
1530 In the following the current diagnostic approaches used in the diagnosis of AD are illustrated with
reference to our 59 year old patient

Fig 3 A and tau imaging with FBB top and bottom 
of our 59 year old patient with Alzheimers disease FBB and
 binding patterns demonstrate the different distributions
of A and tau deposits in the brain of our Alzheimers disease
patient FBB PET scan revealed a massive global amyloid load
with a pronounced FBB retention in parietotemporal frontal
and posterior cingulate precuneal cortices In contrast 
retention was markedly elevated in the hippocampus whereas
onlya slightly increased retention was observed in
parietotemporal cortical areas
Neuropsychological testing is commonly used as an
aid in diagnosing AD In our patient the scores of almost
all domains of the CERAD plus battery were well below
average Memory was most severely affected As the
earliest pathological changes in AD occur in medial
temporal lobe structures 31 episodic memory is usually
the first cognitive ability to decline typically followed 
like in our case by additional deficits in language and
semantic knowledge executive functions working memory attention and visuospatial abilities 32 
Results of laboratory testing for example for vitamin 
thyroid function thiamine level and folate were within the
normal range Laboratory testing should be performed in
every AD patient to rule out metabolic causes of dementia 
CSF did not suggest malignancy neuroinflammation or
infection P tau that reflects the intensity of neuronal degeneration was slightly increased Interestingly although
amyloid PET revealed an extensive global amyloid load 
CSF A42 on the other hand was normal It has been
shown that amyloid load at autopsy of AD patients is
inversely correlated to CSF A42 whereas tau load is
positively correlated to CSF P tau and total tau 33 Yet
although CSF and amyloid PET measurements of A42
are consistent in the majority of patients a dissociation

between A42 measurements is not uncommon 34 
Especially the combination of CSF biomarkers may increase diagnostic certainty of AD pathology Yet as CSF
biomarkers do not change during the clinical phase of
AD they cannot be used as markers of disease progression
35 In comparison to AD patients DLB and FTD
patients present significantly lower P tau and total tau
levels 17 There is however some overlap in CSF P tau
and total tau between AD DLB and FTD patients A42 is
generally decreased in DLB Most studies could not define
valuable CSF A42 cut off scores for differentiation of
DLB from AD 36 CSF A42 levels of FTD patients on
the other hand are significantly higher compared to AD
patients 18 The combination of CSF P tau total tau and
A42 has shown high diagnostic sensitivity and specificity
in distinguishing AD from DLB and FTD patients In CTE
one would expect normal CSF A42 levels and an elevated
P tau total tau ratio 14 Large biomarker studies on
autopsy confirmed CTE cases however are lacking AS
CSF P tau was only slightly increased while CSF total tau
and A42 were within the normal range CSF analysis was
not suggestive of an underlying AD pathology in our case 
The MRI scan was interpreted as normal at routine
diagnostics especially no sign of normal pressure hydrocephalus cerebrovascular disease tumours or regional 
global atrophy could be detected Volumetric MRI analysis
however revealed significant atrophy of the parietal and
temporal lobe especially of the hippocampus and may
therefore be useful to obtain rater independent and
objective results 7 8 Comparison of atrophy patterns
can differentiate AD patients with a high sensitivity and
specificity from healthy controls and other dementia syndromes like DLB and FTD 20 In DLB significant gray
matter loss is detectable in bilateral amygdalae the middle
temporal lobe as well as the dorsal ponto mesencephalic
junction area 20 In FTD patients atrophy is normally
restricted to the frontal and temporal lobes with relative
sparing of the parietal and occipital lobes MRI may also
be useful to detect neuropathological changes observed in
CTE like whole brain atrophy or cavum septum pellucidum with occasional fenestration 24 In our case volumetric MRI analysis showed a typical AD atrophy pattern
with pronounced atrophy of the parietal and temporal
lobe especially the hippocampus and therefore supported
the diagnosis of AD In Alzheimers disease patients especially hippocampal atrophy Fig 1 seems to be highly
correlated with episodic memory impairment 37 
In the FDG PET scan Fig 2 the typical AD pattern
consisting of a reduction of cerebral glucose metabolism
in precuneus posterior cingulate and parietotemporal
association cortices 38 could be detected In comparison 
DLB patients show an additional significant metabolic
reduction in the occipital cortex particularly the primary
visual cortex which distinguishes DLB with a high
Page 5 of 8
sensitivity and specificity from AD patients 25 FTD on
the other hand causes hypometabolism in the frontal
lobes the anterior temporal cortex and anterior cingulate
cortex 27 FDG PET studies that evaluated glucose
metabolism in subjects with repetitive brain trauma have
shown inconsistent findings 39 40 In summary FDGPET clearly supported AD as the most probable diagnosis
in our case Like structural MRI FDG PET represents a
marker of neuronal injury Retrospective investigations
showed a sensitivity of 84 and a specificity of 74 for
FDG PET in predicting post mortem AD pathology at
autopsy 41 FDG PET thereby outperformed the initial
clinical evaluation Furthermore FDG PET seems to be a
suitable predictor of conversion to AD in patients with
mild cognitive impairment 42 
Amyloid and tau Pet represent new diagnostic tools 
To present a definite diagnosis of AD relies on postmortem histopathology Yet these new imaging techniques
permit non invasive visualization and quantification of the
two histological hallmarks of the disease 
Amyloid PET showed a characteristic increase of tracer
uptake in cortical regions known to have a high amount
of amyloid burden in AD i e frontal parietal and lateral
temporal cortex Fig 3 DLB patients can show a similar
pattern yet with lower amount of A ligand binding compared with AD patients 43 FTD patients on the other
hand display low cortical tracer retention such that amyloid PET has shown high accuracy in discriminating AD
from FTD 44 45 Variable degrees of diffuse  amyloid
can be detected in about 47 of autopsy confirmed CTE
cases 46 Amyloid PET may therefore differentiate
between CTE and AD by identifying different amyloiddeposition patterns Further studies are needed to determine the topography of  amyloid depositions in CTE 
Showing a high amount of tracer uptake in parietotemporal frontal and posterior cingulate precuneus cortex 
FBB PET was suggestive for AD in our case Recent phase
III studies in which the in vivo uptake of 18 F labelled
amyloid tracers was compared to post mortem amyloid
load showed a sensitivity and specificity of 88 to 92 and
88 to 100 respectively for the detection of amyloid deposits in AD patients 4749 As amyloid deposition
probably represents a very early event in the course of the
disease that occurs years before onset of dementia symptoms amyloid PET may allow early and even presymptomatic diagnosis 4 
Increased tau tracer retention could be detected in
parietotemporal cortical areas especially in the hippocampus Fig 3 In contrast to amyloid PET the sensitivity and
specificity of tau PET imaging have yet to be determined 
Post mortem studies have shown that the amount of tau
deposition is highly related to the severity of dementia
50 In addition to aiding in the early and differential
diagnosis of Alzheimers disease tau PET may therefore
Schnecker et al BMC Neurology 2016 16 131
Page 6 of 8
serve as a marker of disease progression Recently first
experiences with tau PET in DLB were reported 51 Tau
deposition is elevated in some cases of DLB especially in
the inferior temporal region Tau PET scans may be
positive in some variants of FTD A first case report of a
L MAPT mutation carrier showing elevated tau
tracer uptake in frontal anterior temporal and parietal
cortex as well as in basal ganglia has been published 30 
Hitherto a single case report of a patient with a clinical
diagnosis of CTE who underwent tau PET imaging has
been published 52 Increased tracer uptake could be
detected in globus pallidus putamen hippocampus and
substantia nigra Because of increased tracer retention in
basal ganglia the detected distribution of tracer retention
seemed more suggestive of progressive supranuclear palsy 
However the patient did not manifest the typical clinical
symptoms of progressive supranuclear palsy In summary
tau PET also supported a diagnosis of AD in our case 
Overall although CSF A42 was normal the combination of biomarker and neuroimaging findings in this
case was still suggestive of AD pathology Table 2 rates
the biomarker and neuroimaging findings of our case
with respect to possible differential diagnosis 
As some of the illustrated diagnostic approaches provided converging evidence e g CSF P tau MRI FDGPET and Tau PET each indicated an AD typical neuronal
degeneration and thereby provided somewhat redundant
information the necessity for a diagnostic algorithm becomes obvious A sequential diagnostic process where
widely available diagnostic tools like neuropsychological
testing to establish the diagnosis of a dementia syndrome
and laboratory testing to exclude metabolic causes of
dementia are performed in a first step may be useful Such
a baseline testing could help to select patients that profit
from further diagnostic work up In a second step CSF
examination and structural MRI may be rational on the
one hand to further exclude potentially treatable causes of
dementia like neuroinflammation or normal pressure
hydrocephalus and on the other hand to obtain evidence
for an AD related pathological process and AD typical

furthermore be useful for patient recruitment and serve as
a surrogate marker for monitoring the efficacy of future
anti tau or anti amyloid strategies
