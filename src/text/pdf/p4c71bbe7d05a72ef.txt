Background Aerobic exercise training AET has been shown to provide general health benets and to improve
motor behaviours in particular in individuals with Parkinsons disease PD However the inuence of AET on
their motor learning capacities as well as the change in neural substrates mediating this effect remains to be explored 
Objective In the current study we employed functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging fMRI to assess the effect
of a 3 month AET program on the neural correlates of implicit motor sequence learning MSL 
Methods 20 healthy controls HC and 19 early PD individuals participated in a supervised high intensity stationary recumbent bike training program 3 times week for 12 weeks Exercise prescription started at 20 min
 5 min week up to 40 min based on participants maximal aerobic power Before and after the AET program 
participants brain was scanned while performing an implicit version of the serial reaction time task 
Results Brain data revealed pre post MSL related increases in functional activity in the hippocampus striatum
and cerebellum in PD patients as well as in the striatum in HC individuals Importantly the functional brain
changes in PD individuals correlated with changes in aerobic tness a positive relationship was found with increased activity in the hippocampus and striatum while a negative relationship was observed with the cerebellar
activity 
Conclusion Our results reveal for the rst time that exercise training produces functional changes in known
motor learning related brain structures that are consistent with improved behavioural performance observed
in PD patients As such AET can be a valuable non pharmacological intervention to promote not only physical
tness in early PD but also better motor learning capacity useful in day to day activities through increased plasticity in motor related structures

Introduction
Parkinsons disease PD is a progressive disorder of multifactorial
etiology characterized by motor symptoms such as tremor rigidity bradykinesia and gait difculties Motor decits in PD are due to an abnormal neuronal activity of the motor circuit in the basal ganglia

predominantly involving the striatum and the putamen Amano et al 
2013 Such brain dysfunctions lead to motor functional difculties including impairments in learning new motor skills Clark 2014 hence
adding burden to day to day activities and leading sometimes to inactivity and exacerbation of disease manifestation van Nimwegen et al 
2011 As a result both the known striatal pathology in PD and the
lack of physical activity imposed by the disease can jeopardize the patients capacity to acquire new motor skilled behaviours throughout
the progression of the neurodegenerative process 
Apart from the treatments commonly used to managed PD symptoms e g dopaminergic derived drug treatments and DBS alternative

treatments such as physical activity have recently been investigated in
PD Such a new approach is based on an increasing number of studies in
animals and humans which indicate that physical exercise may attenuate symptoms of the disease and even exert a neuroprotective effect
 Hirsch and Farley 2009 In rodents for example mice model of PD
forced to exercise on a treadmill did not develop behavioural decits
and signicantly preserved nigrostriatal neuronal connections as well
as striatal dopamine levels compared to sedentary mice Pothakos et
al 2009 Yoon et al 2007 Petzinger et al 2007 have also found
that a similar exercise intervention improves efciency of brain dopamine cells more in mice who exercised as compared to those that did
not Altogether these results suggest that exercise improves dopaminergic neurotransmission efciency by modifying the areas of the
brain e g the substantia nigra and basal ganglia where dopamine signals originate Petzinger et al 2007 Given that movement is modulated through dopamine ndings in rodents suggest a possible interaction
between behaviour and neuronal cerebral viability in the striatum after
cardiovascular exercise Petzinger et al 2010 
In humans studies in PD individuals have demonstrated signicant
improvement in gait and mobility following supervised physical exercise Beall et al 2013 Herman et al 2007 Nadeau et al 2014 Ridgel
et al 2011 2009 van Eijkeren et al 2008 Among the many different
types of physical training programs e g resistance training exibility 
coordination etc aerobic exercise training AET has been the most
studied so far and the one that has shown the most unequivocal benets on health across the life span Voss et al 2011 Although the underlying mechanisms in PD still remain conjectural it has been
hypothesized that exercise dependent plasticity following AET acts on
the brain in a similar manner as the dopaminergic derived treatments 
using the same pathways to produce symptomatic relief Beall et al 
2013 It is thus possible that exercise dependent change can have benecial effects on motor skill learning processes More specically AET
may restore motor sequence learning MSL a capacity that is frequently impaired in PD Clark 2014 by improving brain functioning at the
level of the striatum or motor related associated circuits 
Despite behavioural impairment observed when performing MSL
tasks studies have demonstrated that similar motor related brain regions seem to be recruited in individuals with PD Carbon et al 2010 
Schendan et al 2013 Werheid et al 2003 as in healthy aging controls
 Albouy et al 2015 Doyon et al 2003 Specically functional brain
imaging studies with healthy participants have shown that brain plasticity associated with MSL relies on recruitment of striatum and hippocampus as well as the cerebellum motor cortical regions and
prefrontal and parietal cortex Albouy et al 2015 Doyon et al 2009 
Studies with PD individuals yielded similar regions but different patterns of interaction between them in the cortico striatal and mediotemporal lobe networks Carbon et al 2010 Schendan et al 2013 
Werheid et al 2003 Furthermore these ndings could be inuenced
by the disease stage and the impact of dopaminergic medication see
Ruitenberg et al 2015 for a review However studies directly comparing the neuronal substrate involved in MSL in healthy and PD are few
and those directly comparing the effects of aerobic exercise on the
MSL neuronal substrate in healthy and PD are non existent In fact 
one study demonstrated that a single bout of high intensity aerobic exercise facilitates motor sequence learning in healthy individuals Mang
et al 2014 but the neural correlates of these effects have never been
investigated at the whole brain level and furthermore they have
never been specic to the chronic effects of exercise 
Thus to date there is a lack of evidence regarding the effects of aerobic training exercise on the MSL functional neuronal substrate in both
healthy and PD In response to this knowledge gap the principal aim of
the present study was to investigate with whole brain functional magnetic resonance imaging fMRI the neural substrate mediating the effects of cardiorespiratory exercise on MSL in both PD and healthy
control HC individuals We have already presented behavioural evidence that 3 month AET improved MSL capacity in both healthy and
PD individuals as well as executive functions in PD Duchesne et al 
2015 In the current article we present the neuroimaging data related
to MSL from the same study and we hypothesize that 1 AET will improve MSL capacity through augmented activity in the cortico striatal
 CS system in PD and 2 MSL related cerebral activity changes observed after AET will be linked to improvement in aerobic tness in
both PD and HC groups 
Methods
2 1 Participants
Forty two participants 21 PD patients and 23 HC were eligible for
participation after the completion of the rst evaluation However between the evaluation and prior to the onset of the exercise regimen 
two HC participants decided to withdraw from the project for personal
reasons One PD participant and one HC were excluded after the beginning for health security One PD patient was excluded from analysis because of extreme results on several outcomes even if this person
respected all inclusion criteria PD patients had to be classied as stage
1 or 2 according to Hoehn and Yahrs scale Hoehn and Yahr 1967 
based upon evaluation of a certied neurologist Participants who
were under medication continued their treatment all throughout the
study testing and training A total of 39 participants 18 women 
aged between 40 and 80 years old participated in the present study 
19 were diagnosed with PD and 20 were healthy control HC subjects 
They were screened for appropriateness for testing in an MR environment e g no metallic implants that could interfere with testing no
claustrophobia etc Then the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire PAR Q Warburton et al 2011 was used to verify the
participants safety in participating in a physical program To control
for pre existing experience in tasks requiring highly coordinated nger
dexterities PD and HC subjects had to have no previous training in
playing a musical instrument nor any training as a professional typist 
Other exclusion criteria included the presence of other neurological disorders comorbidities likely to affect gait or any history of smoking or
heart diseases and high baseline physical activity 
These two groups were well matched with respect to their sex distribution age number of years of education and tness level as there
were no signicant differences on any of these variables prior to the
AET intervention program see Table 1 Yet and as expected signicant
group differences were found on Becks depression and anxiety scales 
with PD patients showing higher scores on both scales as compared
with HC participants

2 2 Clinical assessment of health and cardiovascular tness
2 4 Behavioural statistical data analysis
First PD subjects were recruited based on a neurological assessment
performed by an expert neurologist Clinical assessments of the participants health and physical activity level were then performed by a
geriatrist neuropsychologist and physiologist using the following
tests the United Parkinsons Disease Rating Scale UPDRS Goetz et
al 2008 the Montreal Cognitive Assessment MOCA or Mini Mental
State Evaluation MMSE Nazem et al 2009 the Beck Depression Inventory BDI Beck and Beamesderfer 1974 and Beck Anxiety Inventory BAI Osman et al 1997 as well as the Jacksons Questionnaire
 Jackson et al 1990 
Participants cardiovascular tness level was evaluated using either a
submaximal aerobic test 11 HC 5 PD or a medically supervised maximal oxygen uptake test 9 HC 14 PD The protocol required a ve minutes resting period before measuring heart rate blood pressure and
aerobic capacity For the evaluated with a sub maximal test using a recumbent bike the test started with a workload stage of 35 or 50 W for
women and men respectively lasting one minute the intensity increasing progressively by 15 W every minute until they reached 85 
of their predicted maximal heart rate HRmax 208  0 7  age 
When the target heart rate was reached participants were asked to
complete the current stage if possible The power level in W of the
last completed stage was used to extrapolate the maximal aerobic
power MAP Then max estimation was calculated with body
weight kg and MAP W measures using the American College
Sport Medicines formula 10 8  W weight  7 MAP estimation was used for exercise prescription For the participants that were
evaluated with a graded cycling one minute workload stage maximal
test the protocol started again at 35 W or 50 W for women and men 
respectively and the intensity progressively increased by 15 W every
minute until maximal efforts criteria were fullled e g age predicted
maximal heart rate  10 bpm and VO plateau or until subjects
could not maintain the required workload anymore fatigue Aerobic
capacity max was measured directly using a breath by breath
system The last completed stage power W was recorded and
used for exercise prescription American College of Sport Medicine 
2006 Importantly PD individuals performed the stress test while
following their usual medication regimen which did not change
during the study period In addition for each patient the stress
tests were administered at the same time of day and did not change
pre to post AET 
The main independent variables included in our analyses were the
presence absence of the disease i e PD vs HC groups between group
variable and the effect of aerobic training expressed as the time of testing pre vs post intervention within group variable Dependent variables included the following physical tness expressed as max
estimate and the subjects performance learning score on the MSL
task We rst assessed the relationship between independent and dependent variables using a mixed repeated measures analysis of variance
 ANOVA with group as between subjects factor and time of testing as
within subjects factor In order to account for the effect of multiple comparisons the statistical signicance was adjusted using the Bonferroni
method The two psychological variables depression and anxiety 
were used as covariates in all subsequent analyses involving behavioural data to control for group differences at baseline on these variables All
analyses were performed with SPSS 20 IBM Inc Armonk NY 
2 3 Motor sequence learning task
Subjects implicit MSL capacity was evaluated using a version of
the serial reaction time SRT task Nissen and Bullemer 1987 in
which participants were asked to press buttons on a keyboard in response to corresponding visual stimuli presented on a screen Unbeknown to the participants stimuli were presented in a random or in
a repeating sequential order in blocks of 40 stimuli each These
blocks were presented in triplets sequence random sequence 
with a total of 12 triplets during the entire training session For
the sequential blocks two 8 item second order conditional
sequences 2 and 3 were used and
counterbalanced between sessions pre post AET and subjects 
in order to avoid repetition of the learned sequence for the same individual For each trial reaction time i e the time between the onsets of the stimulus to the completion of the response To assess
sequence learning reaction times RTs and accuracy were compared between the sequence and random blocks with faster RTs
and better accuracy for sequence as compared to the random blocks
reecting greater motor sequence learning capacity More information on motor task procedure can be found in previous paper
 Duchesne et al 2015 
2 5 Experimental procedure
Participants were tested on two time points pre and post training 
Each occasion was similar and included two different days of testing
that occurred at least 48 h apart On day 1 participants were rst informed in details about the study protocol before signing a consent
form which was approved by the Regroupement Neuroimagerie Qubec Ethics Review Committee Participants were then evaluated with
respect to their functional capacities and cardiorespiratory tness
level as well as to their medical and psychological status This was
followed by giving instructions to participants regarding the scanning
procedure and the motor sequence learning task while lying in a mock
scanner During this familiarization session participants had time to
practice a randomly assigned trial to correct the positioning of the ngers on the response box On Day 2 participants brain was then
scanned while completing the motor sequence task while positioned
in the magnetic resonance imaging system available at the Unit de
Neuroimagerie Fonctionnelle from the Universit de Montral the
latter session occurring before and after the AET program 
2 5 1 The exercise protocol procedure
The cardiorespiratory tness program involved three months of recumbent bike training three times a week 1 h session which occurred
at the same time of day The exercise intensity prescription was based
on the subjects maximal aerobic power output from the maximum volume of oxygen VOpeak uptake conducted on pre test day American
College of Sport Medicine 2006 Duration of the exercise program
started at 20 min and 60 of intensity per session and was then increased by steps of 5 min and 5 of intensity every week until participants reached 40 min of training at 80 intensity To reach a highintensity level bike speed was maintained at 60 rpm As such to achieve
the desired bike resistance power and adjust intensity level if needed 
the work intensity was based on power output Watt controlling for
subjects heart rate In addition rate of perceived exertion Borg scale 
 Borg 1982 was assessed on each training session The target of 75 
or more in participation rate in the tness training program was
achieved In addition PD individuals did not change their medication
regimen for the entire duration of the study 
2 6 fMRI data acquisition and analysis
Functional MRI series were acquired using a 3 0T TIM TRIO scanner
system Siemens Erlangen Germany equipped with a 12 channel
head coil Multislice weighted fMRI images were obtained with a gradient echo planar sequence using axial slice orientation in an ascending

256  256  176 voxel size 1  1  1 was also acquired in all
subjects Head movements were minimized using cushions and instructions prior to scanning 
Functional volumes were pre processed and analysed using 
 http www l ion ucl ac uk spm software Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience London UK implemented in MATLAB 
Functional scans of each session were realigned using rigid body transformations iteratively optimized to minimize the residual sum of squares
between the rst and each subsequent image separately for each session 
hence creating a mean realigned image The mean functional image was
then coregistered to the structural image using a rigid body transformation optimized to maximize the normalized mutual information between the two images Coregistration parameters were then applied to
the realigned BOLD time series An average subject based template was
created using DARTEL in and registered to MNI space Montreal
Neurological Institute http www bic mni mcgill ca All functional and
anatomical images were then normalized using the resulting template Finally all functional images were spatially smoothed using an isotropic 8mm full width at half maximum FWHM Gaussian kernel 
The analysis of fMRI data based on a summary statistics approach 
was conducted in 2 serial steps accounting respectively for xed and
random effects For each subject changes in brain regional responses
were estimated through a model including responses to the sequence
and random conditions separately in each practice session pre and
post These four regressors consisted of boxcars convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function Instructions as well as movement parameters derived from realignment of the functional volumes
were also included as covariates of no interest High pass ltering was
implemented in the design matrix using a cut off period of 128 s to remove slow drifts from the time series Serial correlations in fMRI signal
were estimated using an autoregressive order 1 plus white noise
model and a restricted maximum likelihood ReML algorithm 
The contrast of interest explored the main motor sequence learning
effect Sequence Random between sessions POST PRE The
resulting contrast images of each subject were then further spatially
smoothed Gaussian kernel 6 mm FWHM and entered in a secondlevel analysis accounting for inter subject variance In the second
level analyses one sample t tests were performed to explore main
motor sequence learning effect between sessions within each group
 HC and PD separately Subsequently two sample t tests were performed in order to compare this effect between groups HC vs PD 
Furthermore we performed an additional analysis in order to assess the
relationship between these changes in brain activation and aerobic tness
across sessions Specically the main sequence learning effect between
sessions was regressed against changes in aerobic tness to ascertain
whether these effects were related to the AET As before one sample ttests were performed to explore the regression effects within each group
 HC and PD separately and two sample t tests were performed in order
to compare the regression effects between groups HC vs PD 
The set of voxel activation values resulting from each analysis described
above activation and regression analyses were displayed in statistical
maps at a threshold of p b 0 005 uncorrected for multiple comparisons 
However all statistical inferences were performed at a threshold of
p b 0 05 after family wise error FWE correction for multiple comparisons

structures of interest reported in published work on motor learning 
Results
3 1 Behavioural results
3 1 1 Aerobic exercise training
The 3 months aerobic training regimen yielded a signicant improvement in aerobic tness as indicated by the estimated max in
the two groups combined 35 17 333 p b 0 001 as well as in
both HC 35 15 188 p b 0 001 and PD 35 9 984 p b 0 003 
groups separately see Supplemental materials for more details Also
the estimated power level increased signicantly following AET in the
two groups combined 35 16 461 p b 0 001 as well as in the HC
 35 14 930 p b 0 001 and PD 35 10 500 p b 0 003 groups
separately However there was no signicant group  session interaction nor any group differences for all of these tness measures Altogether these results indicate that the effect of exercise had similar
physiological benets in both groups of participants who signicantly
increased their individual level of aerobic tness Duchesne et al 
3 1 2 Motor sequence learning
The detailed results of the MSL task for the two conditions sequence
and random and groups PD and HC both pre and post training session are reported elsewhere Duchesne et al 2015 and here in Supplemental materials Even though the interaction between groups and
conditions regardless of time of testing i e pre vs post AET was not
signicant 35 0 266 p 0 6 across all participants we observed
a signicant difference in reaction time between conditions 35 
17 712 p b 0 001 with performance during the sequence being faster
than during the random condition an indicator of motor sequence
learning capacity In addition there was a marginally signicant interaction between condition and session 35 3 650 p 0 064 across
the two groups hence demonstrating a trend that the participants
motor sequence learning capacity tended to improve more than their
performance in the random condition following AET 
Within group analyses revealed between session improvement in
reaction time for both sequence 35 12 525 p b 0 001 and random
conditions 35 8 422 p b 0 006 whereas PD individuals showed
AET related improvement in RT only for the sequential condition
 35 5 173 p b 0 029 Most importantly when assessing motor sequence learning capacity in each group we identied a signicant sequence learning effect i e sequential random conditions pre AET
in HC 35 4 059 p 0 052 but not in PD 35 1 427 p 
0 24 After AET however both groups showed signicant sequence
learning 35 7 134 p b 0 011 for HC and 35 8 878 p b 0 005

3 2 Brain imaging results
3 2 1 Functional brain changes related to motor learning capacity following
AET in PD
To investigate the effects of AET on the neural correlates specic to
motor sequence learning we contrasted the main sequence learning effect Sequence  Random by session POST  PRE within PD group The
results of this analysis revealed signicant training related changes for
PDs individuals Specically brain responses reecting motor sequence
learning capacity increased signicantly post AET in the temporal lobes 
left ventral striatum left hippocampus cerebellar lobules 8 and 9 bilaterally and right crus Table 2 Fig 1 
To test whether pre post functional brain changes expressing motor
learning capacity were indeed related to improvement in aerobic tness we conducted a regression analysis between changes in estimated
max and changes in MSL brain responses Sequence 
Random  session POST  PRE In PD patients increases in max
 indicating improved aerobic tness as a result of training correlated
positively and signicantly with increases activity in the hippocampus
bilaterally Table 2 Fig 2 and the left dorsal striatum This indicated
that as the aerobic capacity improved in PD patients the motor learning
specic activation also increased in these brain regions In contrast a
signicant negative correlation was observed in bilateral cerebellum
lobe 7 8 and 9 Table 2 Fig 2 
While the regions corresponding to the main sequence learning effect and those resulting from the regression analysis were found in similar macro structures i e hippocampus striatum they did not
spatially overlap 
3 2 2 Functional brain changes related to motor learning capacity following
AET in HC
The main learning effect Sequence  Random by session POST 
PRE assessed within the HC group revealed no signicant change in activity between sessions The regression analysis Sequence 
Random  session POST  PRE also revealed no signicant correlation
between AET related changes in aerobic capacity and brain changes related to motor learning capacity for HC group alone

Discussion
We recently reported that 12 weeks of progressive intense AET resulted in signicant improvement in aerobic tness as well as motor
skill learning in both PD and HC groups Duchesne et al 2015 AET related MSL improvements were global in HC individuals as they were observed in both conditions sequence and random but were specic to
the sequence condition in PD patients In addition PD patients improved their sequence specic motor learning capacity after aerobic
training as indicated by the signicant difference between sequence
and random conditions after the training period only Interestingly in
the present study the neuroimaging results corroborate those behavioural ndings and suggest that AET related changes in motor sequence
learning capacity i e difference between sequence and random conditions are mainly seen in PD individuals Specically increases in MSLspecic brain activity due to training were found in the temporal lobe 
Fig 3 Greater MSL related functional brain changes in PD patients than in healthy controls after AET

hippocampus striatum and cerebellum in the PD group Importantly 
there was also a positive relation between the patients change in aerobic tness and MSL related changes in the hippocampal and striatal activity while we found a negative relation between the change in tness
level and activity in the cerebellum in PD patients Most importantly 
the effects at the cerebral level are larger in the PD than in the HC group 
4 1 1 1 MSL exercise dependent plasticity related to the striatum and hippocampus in PD individuals
The current study is the rst to examine the changes in neural substrate supporting MSL following aerobic exercise training in both
healthy controls and PD patients Our ndings thus extend the neuroimaging literature on implicit MSL in PD individuals and HC participants
 Gamble et al 2014 Ruitenberg et al 2015 Siegert et al 2006 by specically highlighting the positive effects of AET on the MSL related activity in the striatum cerebellum and all structures that are typically
involved in motor learning Albouy et al 2013 Doyon et al 2009 
2011 In fact our hypothesis regarding changes in MSL specic to
striatal changes following AET was conrmed in PD individuals This
nding is consistent with previous studies which have revealed AETdependent neuroplasticity in the central nervous system due to neurochemical changes in the striatum the latter having been proposed as
one possible mechanism of action to explain the gains in performance
on motor tasks in PD Petzinger et al 2010 2011 2013 2015 Indeed 
research in animal models of PD using dopaminergic neurotoxins has
shown that behavioural motor ameliorations following physical exercise are associated with increased efciency in dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission Fisher et al 2013 Paillard et al 2015 
Petzinger et al 2013 2010 2015 which together are thought to reduce
the cortically driven hyper excitability observed in PD patients These
authors have reported an increase in dopamine availability coupled
with a greater expression of dopamine receptors hence producing
a better dopaminergic signaling in the striatum overall Furthermore 
physical exercise has been found to diminish the amount of synaptic
glutamate release which is known to decrease the level of cortical excitability Fisher et al 2004 Although conjectural it is thus probable that
the AET specic changes in striatal activity observed in the current
study may reect this type of neurochemical mechanism which
would in turn explain the improvement in motor learning 
Interestingly our results revealed that AET related and MSL specic
functional brain changes are not only observed in the striatum but
within the hippocampus and cerebellum as well These ndings could
suggest that such brain structures are part of the functional network
compensating for the typical dysfunction within the cortico striatal circuits seen in PD In fact the reported positive relationship between
changes in aerobic tness and AET related MSL brain changes in the
same macro structures hippocampus and striatum is consistent with
emerging data suggesting that links between the hippocampus and
the dopaminergic systems in PD are important in memory and learning
C Duchesne et al NeuroImage Clinical 12 2016 559569
 Calabresi et al 2013 In their review Calabresi et al 2013 suggested
that while dopamine dependent impairment involving a complex molecular dysfunction at glutamatergic synapses of hippocampal longterm potentiation LTP might contribute to cognitive impairments in
PD such interactions could also be a potential source of symptoms reduction in PD patients Clinical interventions such as AET for example 
could potentially stimulate neurogenesis in the dysfunctional hippocampus of PDs individuals as it has been shown in rodents studies
 Voss Vivar Kramer and van Praag 2013 This type of interventions
could also be responsible for the associated involvement of neurotrophic factors as a greater expression in brain derived neurotrophic factor
 BDNF and LTP mechanisms following exercise has also been proposed
as a putative mechanism responsible for the neuroprotective effects and
functional improvements in this clinical population Audiffren Andr 
and Albinet 2011 Dishman et al 2006 Fabel and Kempermann 
2008 Gomez Pinilla Zhuang Feng Ying and Fan 2011 Mustroph et
al 2012 Voss Vivar Kramer and van Praag 2013 Based on evidence
that exercise dependent brain changes within the hippocampus have
been associated with functional changes in memory Erickson et al 
2011 Szabo et al 2011 we can thus conjecture that the improvement
observed during MSL in PD following AET could be explained by LTPlike processes due to greater expression of BDNF in the hippocampus 
In light of these recent ndings Calabresi et al 2013 it can be hypothesized that the benecial effect that AET has on MSL related activity in both of these regions may be based on the interaction or
functional connectivity between them It is possible that plastic AETand MSL related changes may rst occur within the hippocampus and
then propagate in basal ganglia via interactions between the MTL and
dopaminergic system This assumption is based on the fact that while
MSL related changes were observed in both hippocampus and striatum
in PD individuals only in the hippocampus we found regions in which
MSL related changes in activity remained positively correlated with improvements in aerobic tness when PD and HC participants were compared Yet further functional connectivity investigations are still
necessary to elucidate such AET related brain reorganisation 
indicating a restoration of functionality in the network typically seen
in MSL 
According to the motor sequence learning literature both the cerebellum and striatum are known to be involved in the early MSL phase 
while only the striatum has been shown to maintain its activity in
later learning stages when the memory trace has been consolidated
 Doyon et al 2009 2011 2002 Therefore while modest improvements in aerobic capacity linked with increases in cerebellar activity
may reect learning in the early stage tested here the fact that large improvements in aerobic tness were associated with an enhanced hippocampal and striatal functioning may reect a transition towards a more
durable stage of MSL These MSL ndings are thus in line with previous
structural and physiological investigations which parallel the functional
changes that aerobic exercise can exert in general e g Hillman

4 1 1 3 MSL and exercise in HC individuals
Compared to PD individuals AET did not have a statistically signicant effect on changes in the neural correlates of MSL in the HC group 
Such divergence between the HC and PD groups could be explained
by a potential ceiling effect observed at baseline for the HC group in
regards to their MSL capacity at both the behavioural and cerebral
level Given that HC individuals already showed a good MSL capacity
prior to AET they obviously had less room for sequence specic behavioural improvement compared to PD patients This is supported by the
fact that analysis of the behavioural results revealed that while HC individuals improved their motor performance in both random and sequence condition after AET they also maintained a similar magnitude
in RT difference between these two conditions Duchesne et al 2015 
This pattern of results can be interpreted as HC individuals having a
more efcient medial temporal lobe CS CC functioning networks
prior to AET as compared to PD patients which leaves also less room
for improvements to be seen in functional activity in these brain areas 
4 1 1 2 MSL exercise dependent plasticity related to the cerebellum in PD
individuals
Limitations and conclusions
In the current study we found that AET related and MSL specic
changes in the cerebellum correlated negatively with changes in aerobic
capacity Although apparently contradictory this result can be
interpreted in light of several lines of evidence from previous studies 
First changes in the cerebellum have been interpreted as a compensatory functional system in animal models of PD model following exercise
 Holschneider Yang Guo and Maarek 2007 Wang Guo Myers 
Heintz and Holschneider 2015a Wang Guo Myers Heintz Peng 
Maarek and Holschneider 2015b and a similar assumption has been
proposed following striatal dysfunction in PD Doyon 2008 Second 
human studies have indicated that both the cortico striatal CS and
cortico cerebellar CC systems play distinctive roles in MSL Doyon 
2008 Doyon and Benali 2005 Doyon et al 2003 Leggio and
Molinari 2015 despite the fact that cerebellum and basal ganglia are
known to be interconnected Bostan and Strick 2010 Hoshi 
Tremblay Feger Carras and Strick 2005 Given the interaction between the CC and CS systems during MSL Doyon 2008 Doyon et al 
2009 Doyon and Benali 2005 and the fact that previous functional imaging data revealed that cerebellar hemispheres are hyperactivated 
while the striatum is hypoactivated in PD patients as compared to
healthy controls Yu Sternad Corcos and Vaillancourt 2007 it is
thus possible that the cerebellum is capable of compensating for the decient basal ganglia activity observed in PD Hence in the current study 
the PD participants who improved less their aerobic capacity used predominantly the cerebellum during MSL whereas those who had higher
changes in aerobic tness used more the hippocampus and striatum 
One of the limitations in our study was the heterogeneity of the patient population Similar to many other studies with PD patients disease
characteristics were diverse e g motor cognitive neuropsychiatric 
etc In fact it was often a challenge to control for all symptoms and obtain a homogeneous sample However we used several strategies to address this limitation First we matched the PD group with the HC group
with respect to sex distribution age years of education cognitive and
tness level In addition given that the two groups differed in their depression and anxiety symptoms we accounted for these variables in our
statistical analyses by considering them as covariates in the analyses of
the behavioural data Another limitation of our study was the lack of a
PD control group for the type of exercise Despite this constraint however it is worth noting the fact that we conducted a regression analysis
highlighting that there were functional brain changes that were related
to changes in aerobic tness level which indicate that there were brain
changes specic to the AET program in PD patients 
To conclude this study is the rst to assess the neural correlates of
MSL following AET in PD Functional reorganisation of brain activity in
early PD following aerobic training was observed within the hippocampus the striatum and the cerebellum resulting in improvement of their
learning capacity Most importantly in the same brain structures albeit
in different sub regions we have also showed that MSL specic brain
plasticity correlated with changes in aerobic tness showing a positive
relationship within the hippocampus and the striatum and a negative
relationship within the cerebellum Altogether our study makes two important contributions to the eld First we show that a 12 week
C Duchesne et al NeuroImage Clinical 12 2016 559569
progressive aerobic training regimen has benecial effects on motor
skill learning in sedentary PD and healthy individuals Second we highlight the neurophysiological changes underlying exercise dependent
plasticity in PD with particular emphasis on the neuronal substrate of
MSL Our results thus pave the way for other studies to further explore
the structural and functional organization within brain regions and how
exercise dependent plasticity manifests itself within the medial temporal lobe CS and CC systems following chronic or acute bouts of aerobic
activities in PD As a result these ndings have important clinical implications for the rehabilitation of PD individuals as the design and the use
of non pharmacological interventions based on physical exercise can be
implemented to improve motor learning capacity and restore motor
functions in patients aficted with this debilitating disease
