AbstractObjective To investigate the extent of medial temporal lobe atrophy MTA on MRI in Parkinson disease PD 
with and without dementia compared with Alzheimer disease AD and dementia with Lewy bodies DLB and to
determine whether MTA correlates with cognitive impairment in PD and PD dementia PDD Methods Coronal weighted MRI scans were acquired from control subjects n  39 and patients with PD n  33 PDD n  31 DLB n 
25 and AD n  31 diagnosed according to standardized clinical diagnostic criteria Cognitive function was assessed
using the Cambridge Cognitive Examination CAMCOG and MTA was rated visually using a standardized Scheltens 
scale Results More severe MTA was seen in PDD p  0 007 DLB p  0 001 and AD p  0 001 vs control subjects 
PD subjects had greater hippocampal atrophy than control subjects p  0 015 but less than subjects with DLB and AD 
though not with PDD MTA correlated with CAMCOG score and memory scores in the DLB group and with age in control 
PDD and AD groups There were no correlations between MTA and cognitive impairment in PD PDD and AD PDD and
DLB had a similar profile of cognitive impairment and MTA Conclusions Medial temporal lobe atrophy MTA was seen
in cognitively intact older subjects with Parkinson disease PD and was not more pronounced in Parkinson disease
dementia PDD Alzheimer disease AD and to a lesser extent dementia with Lewy bodies DLB showed more
pronounced MTA Results suggest early hippocampal involvement in PD and that when dementia develops in PD 
anatomic structures apart from the hippocampus are predominantly implicated Greater hippocampal involvement in AD
vs PDD and DLB is consistent with clinical cognitive and pathologic differences between the disorders 
NEUROLOGY 2005 64 861865
A prospective incidence study reported that more
than three quarters of an older cohort with Parkinson disease PD developed dementia PDD during
an 8 year follow up 1 Early intervention in patients
with PD who are at risk for dementia is important
for future disease modifying therapies Structural
neuroimaging has the potential to play an important
role 
Atrophy of the medial temporal lobe MTA is a
well recognized feature of Alzheimer disease AD 
and can discriminate patients with AD from agematched control subjects 2 However hippocampal
atrophy may not be specific to AD and has been
reported in vascular dementia 5 Studies have shown
medial temporal lobe structures on MRI to be relatively preserved in dementia with Lewy bodies
 DLB vs AD 6 There have been few studies in PDD 
and inconsistencies have emerged One study reported hippocampal atrophy in PDD to be even
greater than in AD 9 whereas others have found hippocampal atrophy in nondemented PD that correlated with impaired episodic memory 10 11
Studies using more sensitive serial MRI methods
have shown significantly greater annual brain volume loss in nondemented PD patients vs control subjects 12 13 We have previously used voxel based
morphometry to demonstrate atrophy of the frontal
lobe in PD that extends to temporal occipital and
parietal lobes in PDD 14
We sought to compare the extent of MTA assessed
visually from MRI scans in subjects with PD with
and without dementia and those with DLB and AD
and control subjects and to examine the relationship
between MTA and cognitive and noncognitive symptoms We hypothesized that MTA would be less common in PDD and DLB than in AD and that MTA
would be more frequent in PD than control subjects 
Methods Subjects The sample consisted of 159 subjects 33
with PD 31 with PDD 25 with DLB 31 with AD and 39 healthy
elderly control subjects Subjects underwent MRI scans as part of
a baseline assessment in a prospective longitudinal study of dementia Patients were recruited from hospital and communitydwelling populations under the care of old age psychiatrists 
geriatricians and neurologists Control subjects were recruited
from friends and spouses of patients or caregivers The Newcastle
and North Tyneside Ethics Committee approved the study All
subjects gave written informed consent to participate

Assessment and diagnosis Subjects underwent detailed physical neurologic and neuropsychiatric examinations which included clinical history and mental state and physical examination
and for demented subjects a standardized blood screen with thyroid function tests vitamin folate and syphilis serology 
Standardized schedules administered included the Mini Mental
State Examination MMSE 15 Cambridge Cognitive Examination
 CAMCOG 16 and Neuropsychiatric Inventory 17 Diagnosis was
made by consensus between experienced clinicians using the National Institute of Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and
Stoke Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for AD 18 the consensus criteria for DLB and PDD 19 and the
UK Parkinsons Disease Society Brain Bank criteria for PD 20
Twenty seven patients with AD met criteria for probable AD and
4 for possible AD 22 DLB patients fulfilled probable and 3 fulfilled possible DLB criteria whereas all PD and PDD patients met
the clinical diagnostic criteria for PD The distinction between
DLB and PDD was made on the basis of the duration of the
parkinsonism as recommended by the consensus diagnostic criteria for DLB 19 Patients whose dementia developed either before or
within 12 months of the onset of parkinsonism were classified as
DLB Those whose dementia developed 12 months or later after
the onset of PD were classified as PDD 
Exclusion criteria for normal subjects were evidence of dementia either from history mental state examination or score of 80
on the CAMCOG or any other major psychiatric neurologic or
physical disorder including drug and alcohol abuse 
MRI procedure All scans were performed on a 1 5 T GE
Signa scanner General Electric Milwaukee WI Whole brain weighed three dimensional fast spin echo spoiled gradient echo data
sets were acquired in the coronal plane repetition time  12 4 milliseconds echo time  4 2 milliseconds inversion time  650 milliseconds matrix  256  256 slice thickness  1 6 mm flip angle  15 
field of view  20 cm in plane resolution  0 78  0 78 mm yielding 124 contiguous slices through the head Standard head positioning was used throughout 
MTA rating A widely used standardized scale Scheltens
Scale was used to rate left and right MTA from hard copies of
 weighted coronal images 3 This scale rates atrophy as 0 absent 1 minimal 2 mild 3 moderate and 4 severe based on
the width of the surrounding CSF spaces temporal horn and
choroid fissure and the height of the hippocampal formation
 which includes the hippocampus proper subiculum and parahippocampal and dentate gyri An example of the different severities
of MTA is shown in figure 1 For the purpose of analysis left and
right scores were summed to give an overall combined MTA score 
ranging from 0 to 8 All scans were rated by the same trained
rater blinded to clinical diagnosis Interrater reliability was assessed between the trained rater and an experienced rater by
measuring 20 subjects Intrarater reliability was assessed by measuring 20 subjects on two occasions 
Statistical analysis The statistical package SPSS for Windows version 11 Chicago IL was used for data analysis Differences between groups on continuous variables were assessed
using analysis of variance with post hoc Tukey tests to determine
group differences For nonparametric data KruskalWallis analysis of variance was used followed by a post hoc MannWhitney U
test or Pearson 2 statistic as appropriate Correlations between
MTA scores age and cognitive function were examined using the
Spearman rank order correlation coefficient All statistical tests
were two tailed and were regarded as significant at p  0 05 
Interrater reliability for visual ratings of scans was assessed using weighted  that controls for chance agreement between raters 
Results Reliability Interrater reliability was regarded
as satisfactory Weighted  values for visual ratings of
atrophy were as follows right MTA 0 60 and left MTA
0 57 Intrarater reliability was excellent with weighed 
values for visual ratings of atrophy as follows right MTA
0 90 and left MTA 0 86

Discussion Our data confirm previous reports
that patients with PD without dementia have more
MTA than age matched control subjects This implies that older PD subjects have progressive MTA
before the onset of dementia In our study PD subjects had more impairment in language expression
 including verbal fluency and executive function
than the control subjects These findings are consistent with reports from community based studies in
early PD showing cognitive impairments in 36 of
newly diagnosed and nondemented PD cases with a
profile and associated imaging changes indicative of
frontostriatal dysfunction 21 22 Mild cognitive impairments of this type in a PD patient in conjunction
with concomitant hippocampal atrophy might provide a presymptomatic marker for dementia risk

Prospective study is needed to further clarify these
associations 
MTA in PDD was less severe than in AD more
closely resembling that seen in DLB These findings
are in agreement with previous and studies and consistent with previous observations using voxel based morphometry of gray matter
loss in temporal lobes in the same sample 14 Differences in MTA between the demented groups could
not be explained by different durations of cognitive
symptoms or severity of global cognitive impairment 
All three demented groups had more extensive MTA
than age matched control subjects Previous studies
have also reported increased atrophy of temporal
lobe structures in both PDD and DLB and neuropathologic studies find the to region of the
hippocampus to be mainly affected in DLB whereas
PD  Parkinson disease PDD  Parkinson disease dementia 
DLB  dementia with Lewy bodies AD  Alzheimer disease 
AD is characterized by involvement of hippocampus and entorhinal cortex 24
The profiles of cognitive impairment in PDD 
DLB and AD groups were consistent with previous
studies 25 AD subjects had more memory impairment
and less impairment in attention visuospatial and
executive function vs PDD and DLB subjects Only
the DLB group had correlations between memory 
global cognitive function and MTA Recent studies
have found memory and MMSE score correlated with
hippocampal volume in DLB 7 AD 26 and also PD and
PDD 10 The absence of correlation could be due to the
relatively simple visual scale which is a global rating including hippocampus parahippocampal gyrus 
and ventricles which may not match onto a cognitive
task in such a way as a single measurement e g of
hippocampus Also possible were floor effects in AD
subjects on the MTA rating as most AD cases scored
6 or 8 out of 8 on the combined score 
The major strength of this study is the recruitment of a large number of community based elderly
patients with late life dementia with comparable
age sex education and duration of dementia MR
images were acquired using a standardized protocol 
and atrophy was assessed blind to diagnosis using
an established scale with satisfactory reliability A
potential criticism of this study is the reliance on
clinical rather than pathologic diagnoses However 
clinical diagnoses were made after detailed assessment and in accordance with standardized criteria in
a center with a proven track record of high accuracy
as judged by autopsy confirmation 27
