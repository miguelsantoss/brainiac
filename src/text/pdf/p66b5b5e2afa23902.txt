Background Magnetic resonance imaging MRI of hippocampal atrophy is a sensitive but not specific method to
support the clinical diagnosis of early Alzheimers disease
 AD We recently described our findings that atrophy of
the entorhinal cortex ERC in frontotemporal dementia
 FTD is equal to that found in AD but that hippocampal
atrophy in FTD is less than that found in AD The MRI
volumes of these structures provide a topographic representation of the region of interest We hypothesized that
two different dementias with distinct histopathologic and
clinical features might in addition to quantitative patterns display topographically different patterns of
atrophy 
Methods We adopted a morphometric approach to monitor the pattern of atrophy of the hippocampus and the
ERC by computing two dimensional profiles from MRI
volumes of the structures in control subjects and patients
with FTD and AD 
Results Compared with control subjects atrophy of the
hippocampus in patients with AD was diffuse In patients
with FTD atrophy of the hippocampus was localized
predominantly in the anterior hippocampus suggesting a
different pattern of hippocampal atrophy in FTD compared with AD The amount and pattern of atrophy of the
entorhinal cortex was virtually equal in both demented
groups 
Conclusions This study provides novel data on the nature
of medial temporal lobe atrophy in FTD Morphometric
MRI may be a useful technique for characterizing different
patterns of atrophy in primary degenerative dementias in

Introduction
A
lzheimers disease AD has distinctive regional predilection and hierarchical topographic distribution of
histopathologic changes within the medial temporal lobe
 MTL or specifically in the entorhinal cortex ERC and
the hippocampus Braak and Braak 1991 Gomez Isla et al
1996 Hyman et al 1984 Although pathology of the MTL
in AD is well documented data on hippocampal atrophy
on frontotemporal dementia FTD is much less consistent 
FTD constitutes a heterogenic disorder if not a spectrum
of disorders affecting mainly frontal and anterior temporal
cortices and often lacking distinctive histopathologic
markers found in other types of dementia Brun 1987 
1993 With regard to the MTL histopathologic studies on
the hippocampus in FTD have shown the involvement of
the hippocampus to range from severe Knopman et al
1990 through modest or varying Bergmann et al 1992 
Nagaoka et al 1995 to minor or no involvement Brun
1993 Filley et al 1994 Kinoshita et al 1997 Fewer data
are available about the ERC 
The pathology of AD in the MTL leads to atrophy of the
MTL structures and volumetric magnetic resonance imaging MRI of hippocampal atrophy is a well established
tool to support the clinical diagnosis of early AD Jack et
al 1997 Laakso et al 1998 The atrophy may lack AD
specificity however We recently have shown that in FTD 
ERC atrophy is equal to that found in AD but hippocampal atrophy is less in FTD than it is in AD Frisoni et al
1999 The purpose of our article is to study whether
different regions of interest ROIs with quantitatively
different volume loss would also display topographically
distinct patterns of volume loss Indeed there is an
increased interest in morphometric brain mapping to study

Genotyping was not available for some subjects 
the topographic changes in relation to function and disease
of the brain For instance researchers have suggested that
three dimensional mapping of the gyral patterns in the
normal brain Kennedy et al 1998 or in AD Mega et al
1998 provide evidence of multiple influences of brain
organization or cognition during development and disease 
Topographic imaging may provide information about
individual brain structures as an integral part of hierarchically ordered components of distributed neural systems In
addition the hippocampus can be analyzed in terms of its
topography In a recent study topographic mapping of the
hippocampus revealed what appear to be specific regional
volume deficits within the hippocampus in patients with
schizophrenia Csernansky et al 1998 No such data exists
on the MTL structures in dementia 
In this study we adopted a morphometric approach to
assess the atrophy of the hippocampus and the ERC in
FTD compared with patients with AD and control subjects This was done by computing two dimensional 2D 
sagittal average profiles of the ROIs in each group to
describe possible differences in the patterns of atrophy in
functionally distinct antero posterior axis of the structures 
This approach is based on the assumption that structure
and function in the brain are not independent but that they
interact Hence the shape of a given structure may also
reflect the integrity of the tissue Van Essen 1997 We
thus hypothesized that two different dementias with distinct pathologies clinical manifestations and different
amounts of MTL damage might display different patterns
of atrophy 
Methods and Materials
Subjects and Clinical Assessment
Subjects in this study have been described previously in more
detail Frisoni et al 1999 Given that the present study included
an additional FTD patient the study protocol and characteristics
are presented briefly The study population consisted of 73
subjects of whom 30 were patients with mild to moderate AD
 mean age 73  9 years 23 female subjects 7 male subjects 13
patients with FTD mean age 62  5 years 3 female subjects 10
males subjects and 30 were control subjects mean age 71  8 
20 female subjects 10 male subjects Table 1 Routine dementia assessment at the Alzheimers unit Brescia Italy was carried
out in all the participants This included clinical and neurologic
examination comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation including Mini Mental State Examination MMSE and Clinical
Dementia Rating CDR laboratory studies including complete
blood count and folic acid thyroid function and chemistry
profile chest x ray ECG EEG 99Tc HMPAO SPECT and CT 
Disease history was questioned from a knowledgeable informant 
focusing particularly on symptoms that might help in the diagnostic differentiation of the dementia form as well as to assess
activities of daily living 
The AD patients met the National Institute of Neurological
and Communicative Disorders and Stroke and the Alzheimers
Disease and Related Disorders Associations criteria for probable
AD McKhann et al 1984 The diagnosis of FTD was made
according to the guidelines by the Lund and Manchester Groups
 1994 The diagnoses of dementia were substantiated in follow up evaluations In SPECT the FTD patients invariably
displayed anterior hypoperfusion whereas the hypoperfusion in
the AD patients tended to be temporoparietal None of the FTD
or AD patients had clinical features of Parkinsonism motor

neuron disease or progressive aphasia in the absence of other
cognitive or behavioral disturbances A vascular component was
excluded clinically as an absence of sudden onset and focal
symptoms and further by the findings in CT and MRI A
neurologist and a psychologist examined the control subjects 
The control group consisted of the patients relatives mostly
spouses who did not have any detectable cognitive deficits and
who had a negative history of any neurological disease 
Written informed consent was obtained from both cases and
control subjects or from their primary caregivers after discussion
of risks and benefits of participation No compensation was
provided The local ethics committee approved the study 
MRI Protocol and Analysis
MRI was performed at the Department of Radiology University
of Verona Italy with a 1 5 Tesla scanner Siemens Magnetom 
Erlangen Germany using a standard head coil and a weighted magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo
 TR 10 msec TE 4 msec TI 300 msec flip angle 10 field of
view 250 mm acquisition 2 matrix 160  256 resulting in 128
sagittal images 
Volumetric measurements and analyses were made at the
Kuopio University Hospital Finland The scans were reconstructed coronally oriented perpendicular to the intercommissural line The ROIs were manually traced from contiguous
2 0 mm thick images by a single tracer blinded to the subjects
clinical data using custom made software for a standard Siemens work console The anatomical starting point was the
rostral end of the hippocampus when it first appears below the
amygdala The tracing of the hippocampus ended posteriorly in
the section where the crura of the fornices depart from the lateral
wall of the lateral ventricles Frisoni et al 1999 Laakso et al
1998 The ERC volumes were traced according to the recent
criteria by Insausti et al 1998 In brief the most anterior slice
measured was the one after the appearance of temporal stem and
the last slice was the one where the uncus and gyrus intralimbicus were no longer separable 
Once the ROI has been traced the software calculates the
volume for every structure in by computing the number of
voxels for each traced image After the tracing is complete the
software also displays the sagittal lateral profile of the measured structure for each subject This profile is formed from each
measured slice area displayed on the y axis and the length
 number of slices on the x axis The group profiles were
calculated by averaging the profiles for each subject from each of
the three groups Because of the slightly different number of
slices between individuals the volume profile was computed by
linear interpolation between separate slices for a relative length
of 100 and the subvolumes were computed for 5 intervals
 i e the number of ROIs for each subject was transformed to 20
for each subject This was done by using customized macros
written for the statistical software for every given number of
slices The atrophy of regions within the ERC and the hippocampus was explored by subdividing the ROIs into three subregions
along their antero posterior axis i e anterior 35  medial
40 70  and posterior 75100  subregions 
The intraclass correlation coefficient of the intrarater variabil 
ity was 0 95 for the hippocampus volumes and 0 90 for the ERC 
The coronal intracranial area at the level of the anterior commissure was used for normalization of the volumetric data Frisoni et
al 1999 Laakso et al 1998 For data presentation purposes the
volumes reported here are normalized to the intracranial area
according to the following formula volume intracranial area 
Statistics
One way analysis of variance ANOVA with the Duncan post
hoc analysis was used to compare the means between study
groups Differences of proportions were assessed with chi square
test The relationship of volumes with gender and age was
assessed with multivariate ANOVA with the hippocampal and
ERC volumes as dependent variables and gender and age age
less than 69 and 70 years or older as factors The results are
expressed as mean  SD The level of statistical significance of
the differences is p  05 
Results
The age difference between the FTD group the AD group 
and the control group was significant F  8 2 p  001 
with the FTD group being younger and differing from both
the AD and control groups in the post hoc analysis There
were more male patients among the FTD group were than
among either the AD and control groups 2 2  4 9 p

As expected both the AD group and the FTD group
performed significantly worse on the MMSE F  56 7 
p  0001 Table 1 compared with control subjects In the
post hoc analysis the FTD patients scored significantly
worse than the AD patients on the MMSE p  05 By
contrast the distribution on the CDR scale indicated less
severe global dementia in the FTD patients although the
finding was not statistically significant Memory disturbances and disorientation at onset were more frequent in
the AD group whereas both behavioral oral and dietary
changes and language disturbances dominated the clinical
picture of the FTD patients data not presented Disease
duration did not differ significantly between the demented
groups 30  14 months in FTD vs 41  25 months in
AD The frequency of subjects carrying the 4 allele in
the FTD group 18 was lower than that of the AD group

The relationship between the hippocampal and ERC
volumes with age in the control group was assessed with
correlation and locally weighted regression analyses data
not shown Neither method found any association between the hippocampal and ERC volumes with age 
Furthermore the relationship of volumes with gender and
age was assessed with multivariate ANOVA with the
hippocampal and ERC volumes as dependent variables

interactions of gender and age never approached significance which allowed us to continue the following analyses without further controlling for the effects of age and

exception of the posterior ERC on the right which was
significantly more atrophied in the patients with AD 
The question about the pathology underlying the observed finding is intriguing In AD the pathology of the
hippocampus entorhinal complex is well established
 Braak and Braak 1991 Hyman et al 1984 whereas the
neuroanatomical or neuropathological al substrates for the
current finding in FTD require further exploration Although neuropathological data on FTDs with regard to the
hippocampus have suggested various patterns of atrophy 
several studies seem to support the view for lesser damage 
ranging from minor involvement to no involvement Bergmann et al 1992 Brun 1993 Filley et al 1994 Kinoshita
et al 1997 Nagaoka et al 1995 There are fewer data on
the ERC involvement in FTD There is however some
data to support these findings In a recent study spheroidical enlargements of presynaptic terminals suggestive of a
retrograde degenerative process in FTD were found in the
hippocampus with the spheroids being most abundant in a
region rich in perforant pathway terminals Zhou et al
1998 The ERC was reported to be substantially spared

Discussion
In this study we used volumetric MRI to form 2D
topographic models of the hippocampus and the ERC in
controls subjects patients with AD and patients with
FTD Our previous quantitative finding that both the
hippocampus and ERC are atrophic in both the AD and
FTD groups compared with the control group were repeated with an additional FTD patient Frisoni et al 1999 
In short hippocampal atrophy in FTD was less severe than
in AD whereas the atrophy of the ERC was of equal
degree in both of the patient groups The approach of this
paper however is entirely different from the previous
study and the scope of it reaches beyond the quantitative
terms Judging by the profiles we suggest that hippocampal atrophy in FTD is weighted in the anterior part of the
hippocampus with much less atrophy evident posteriorly 
Particularly on the right side the posterior subregional
volumes are identical in the control and FTD groups The
ERC volumes displayed identical atrophy quantitatively
and topographically in both the patient groups with the

In another study on chromosome 17linked FTD there
was damage of the ERC with the hippocampus being
substantially spared except for degeneration of those
regions receiving input from the perforant pathway The
finding was considered secondary to entorhinal nerve cell
loss Sima et al 1996 
Indeed the hippocampus has its major cortical input
from the ERC The ERC serves as a source of excitatory
input the perforant pathway which projects to the dentate
gyrus the subiculum and beyond to further
internal projections This results in the ventral and dorsal
parts of the hippocampus selectively receiving different
kinds of input Witter and Groenewegen 1992 One
possible explanation for the findings therefore is that
anterior temporal pathology in FTD might lead to direct
involvement of the ERC Alternatively there may be more
extensive disruption of various cortico cortical and cortico basal circuits resulting in damage of the ERC and to
subsequent bystander damage to the hippocampus Given
the neuropathological data suggesting sparing of the hip 
pocampus in FTD this observed pattern of atrophy may
also be nonprogressive In this way FTD differs from AD 
where these regions are not only the first ones to be
affected but also show progressive deterioration and are
among the most severely degenerated regions at the
end stage disease Braak and Braak 1991 Hyman et al
The substantial sparing of the posterior part of the
hippocampus in FTD also implies clinical correlations in
FTD The hippocampus has not only connectional but also
functional differences along its longitudinal axis Colombo et al 1998 Moser et al 1993 Schacter and Wagner
1999 The posterior part of the hippocampus has been
suggested to subserve memory encoding Schacter and
Wagner 1999 as well as visuospatial memory Moser et
al 1993 Notably these functions are considered to be
substantially spared in FTD By contrast deficits in the
more anterior parts of the temporal lobe such as the
amygdala might be associated with the behavioral or
language disturbances prominent in FTD 
Some possible caveats of this study deserve consideration First age gender and disease severity were different between the patients with FTD and those with AD The
patients with AD and the control patients were significantly older than the FTD patients This however takes
place by default if one wants to match the groups with
disease duration or severity because the onset of FTD is
typically younger In fact the younger age of our FTD
patients may favor correct diagnosis of true FTD because
frontal lobe syndromes in the very elderly are common 
but only a minority actually has primary FTD Gislason et
al 1998 Although the MMSE was indicative of greater
severity in the FTD group the other indicators such as
duration CDR and basic and instrumental disability 
pointed toward no difference or slightly greater severity in
the AD group Indeed because the MMSE is highly
dependent on the integrity of language function Goldblum et al 1994 it may not serve as a good instrument for
measurement of global severity in conditions such as FTD 
in which language disturbances are particularly dominant 
With regard to age neither the hippocampal or ERC
volumes were correlated with age in the group of control
subjects in this or other larger studies by our group
 Insausti et al 1998 Laakso et al 1998 or others DeCarli
et al 1994 Sullivan et al 1995 In agreement with
previous studies the hippocampal and the ERC volumes
did not differ between control men and women after
adjustment for head size Insausti et al 1998 Laakso et al
1998 The entorhinal cortex on the right was significantly
longer in control subjects but in absolute terms never
exceeded 2 0 mm There were no differences in the
hippocampal lengths between the groups Nonetheless

mosome 17linked anomalies were available from any of
the subjects possible conceptual bias related with colorful
nosology of FTD cannot be excluded Differentiation of
subtypes of FTD on clinical grounds is difficult if not
impossible Therefore we cannot rule out the possible
impact of different variants of FTD or the possibility of
rare focal AD  presenting with behavioral and language
disturbances and sparing of memory early in the course of
disease Jagust et al 1990 Nonetheless SPECT perfusion
patterns do not indicate any marked heterogeneity of FTD
in this material in that all patients with FTD showed
marked frontal hypoperfusion on SPECT scans Frisoni et
al 1995 Moreover the neuropsychologic pattern also has
been studied in patients with FTD and found to be as
expected from study of the literature marked disturbance
of language production with sparing of nonverbal learning Frisoni et al 1995 The absence of Parkinsonism or
features of motor neuron disease should also reduce
heterogeneity None of the subjects were known to have an
autosomal dominant mode of inheritance and the frequency of apolipoprotein E 4 in FTD did not differ from
control subjects but was significantly lower than in patients with AD Geschwind et al 1998 
Another conceptual factor is related with anatomic and
functional division of the ROIs Whereas the hippocampus
can be divided to three subregionsthe head the body 
and the tail which coarsely correspond the subdivisions in
the present studyno such distinction exists for the ERC 
That however may be beside the point Of relevance here
is the fact that morphometry can be utilized to study
hippocampus and this approach may reveal distinctive
groupwise patterns between the study groups as is the
case in this study The subdivision to three regions rather
should be considered as a means of presentation of the
data By using the method regional differences could be
calculated for every fifth percentile if necessary 
These data provide novel insight into the pattern of
medial temporal lobe damage in FTD In conclusion both
the hippocampus and ERC are atrophic in AD and FTD 
The extent and pattern of atrophy of the ERC is virtually
similar in both of the dementias By contrast the hippocampal atrophy in FTD is less severe than in AD and
appears to be attributable to atrophy located mainly in the
anterior hippocampus with relative sparing of the postrior
part It is possible that the observed pattern of hippocampal damage is secondary to entorhinal pathology Further 
it is suggested that straightforward morphometric approach provides valuable additional information compared
with conventional quantitative MRI It appears possible
that structural imaging may identify different patterns of
atrophy and this can be utilized to better characterize
various primary degenerative dementias with different
underlying pathologies This approach may provide a
means to find substrates to different patterns of structurefunction relationship or functional impairment in vivo
