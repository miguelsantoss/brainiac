WE investigated the neuropsychological correlates of
hippocampal atrophy in Parkinsons disease PD 
patients The memory impaired PD patients had smaller
hippocampi than other PD patients The performance of
PD patients in spatial working memory and attentional
set shifting correlated with the severity of motor defect 
and not with hippocampal atrophy Our results suggests
that failure of verbal visual memory may be related to
hippocampal atrophy in Parkinsons disease On the
contrast the defect in spatial working memory and
attentional set shifting may be sensitive to dysfunction
of fronto striatal systems in PD patients NeuroReport

Parkinsons disease
Introduction
Parkinsons disease PD even at an early stage
impairs performance in tests measuring functions
mediated by the fronto striatal systems such as
spatial working memory SWM and attentional setshifting 13 This impairment may reflect the severity
of striatal dopaminergic 3 and impaired functions
of fronto striatal loops 4 However in PD the
frontal dopamine projections are also adversely
affected 5 suggesting that the progressive dysfunction
of striatal and frontal dopamine transmission may
both contribute for the impaired performance in
frontal tests 2 It is relevant to note that more
severely disabled PD patients are also less accurate
in tests sensitive to dysfunction of hippocampus and
anatomically related medial temporal lobe cortical
structures such as delayed matching to sample test
 DMTS 3 Dopaminergic defect may not contribute
for impaired DMTS memory accuracy since L dopa
withdrawal did not further aggravate DMTS defect
in PD patients 3
We designed the present study to investigate the
hypothesis that impaired declarative memory performance in non demented PD patients is associated
with hippocampal 7 and that hippocampal

atrophy is not related to the degree of fronto striatal
cognitive defects Therefore we compared the
volumes of hippocampi of PD patients that had intact
or impaired memory performance in two tests that
are sensitive to dysfunction of the medial temporal
lobe memory systems DMTS and primacy component of the list learning test 8 To study the selectivity
of the association between hippocampal atrophy and
impaired performance in DMTS and list learning
tests we also measured spatial working memory and
attentional set shifting functions of these patients

had shown adequate clinical anti parkinsonian
response The PD patients were on optimal dopaminergic medication during testing that had been stable
for at least 2 months No subjects received anticholinergic medication during the study period or for
12 months before the initiation of the study In addition to cognitive testing and routine clinical MRI
analysis the investigation of the subjects included
clinical neurological examination and laboratory tests
to exclude medical conditions that could impair cognitive functioning 
Cognitive testing included computerized neuropsychological tests SWM intra dimensional extra
dimensional ID ED attentional set shifting DMTS 
motor screening 11 A computerized system with a
touch sensitive video screen was used These tests
provide non verbal stimuli and record responses
using the touch sensitive screen The subjects were
first familiarized with the testing procedure by letting
them perform a motor screening task in which they
were trained to point accurately at the screen A standard paper and pencil word list learning test was
alsi assessed is a self ordered test of working
memory which also incorporates a strategic search
component to tax central executive function Subjects
had to search through a number of boxes four six
or eight tor a hidden token without returning to a
box which they had already examined on the same
trial to avoid within search errors or which had
already contained a token on the previous trial to
avoid between search errors Tokens were hidden
one at a time and were never hidden in the same box
twice The main measure of this test was betweensearch errors at each level of the test as this has been
shown to separate mild and severe PD patients 
ID is a test of attentional set shifting based
in part on the Wisconsin card sort test WCST 
There are nine stages in which a subject has to learn
a visual discrimination to criterion six consecutive
trials correct The first two stages required a simple
1508 Vol 9 No 7 11 May 1998
visual discrimination SD followed by a reversal
of this discrimination upon reaching criterion
 SDR Another visual dimension is then introduced
which the subject must learn is irrelevant compound
discrimination with stimuli separated CD or
superimposed CD even in the face of a reversal of
the original discrimination compound discrimination
reversal CDR An intra dimensional shift is then
introduced at which point new exemplars of the two
dimensions are given and the subject must now learn
a new discrimination to criterion intra dimensional
shift IDS followed by a reversal of this rule intradimensional reversal IDR The penultimate stage of
the test introduces an extra dimensional shift EDS 
where again new exemplars of the two dimensions
are presented but this time the subject must shift
his or her attention to the dimension which was
previously irrelevant EDS followed finally by a
reversal of this rule extra dimensional reversal 
EDR The EDS is akin to a category shift in the
WCST For each stage of the test the main measure
was the stage successfully attainted The main
measures were the IDR and EDS stages that cannot
and can separate respectively the performance accuracy of mild and severe PD patients 
Visual memory was tested with the DMTS 14 In
the DMTS the subject must match patterns in either
a delayed or simultaneous condition In the simultaneous condition the sample and all of the choice
stimuli are present on the screen simultaneously and
the subject must select the choice pattern that matches
the sample exactly In the final condition there are
delays of 1 4 8 and 16 s between the 40 presentations of the sample pattern and the choice stimuli 
The subjects must touch the choice stimulus that
exactly matches the sample If the first response is
incorrect the subject may choose again until the
correct answer is reached or all choice stimuli have
been selected There are three practice trials and then
40 test trials during which delay condition 0 4 8 or

16 s delay are counterbalanced A short break is
allowed after 20 test trials To discourage subjects
from encoding the sample pattern on the basis of one
quadrant only all four choice patterns have one
quadrant in common with the sample The outcome
measure is the percentage of correct responses at
different delays 
Verbal memory was measured with a list learning
test The list learning test consisted of a nine word
list that was read aloud to patients three times 
Immediately after the tester had finished reading the
words the patient repeated as many words as possible
 immediate recall This was repeated three times and
a maximum correct score was 27 9 words  3 repetitions 27 words The patient was asked to again
repeat the words 6 min later delayed recall 
maximum correct score nine words During this
break other cognitive tests were assessed The number
of total correct and false words was measured 
Furthermore the word list was divided into three
parts to study the serial position effect primacy
words 13 intermediate words 46 and recency
words 79 and to examine in detail what component of word list learning is affected by PD 
The subjects were scanned with a 1 5 T Magnetom

coil and coronal 3D gradient echo sequence MPRAGE TR 10sms TE 4 ms TI 250 ms flip angle
120 FOV 250 mm matrix 256  192 one acquisition 8 This resulted in 128 weighted partitions
with slice thickness of 1 51 8 mm The partitions
covering the hippocampus were reformatted into
1 mm contiguous slices perpendicular to the long axis
of the hippocampus The term hippocampus included
the dentate gyrus the hippocampus proper and the
subicular complex The uncal portion of the rostral
hippocampus that is located ventral to the caudal
amygdala was included into the hippocampus The
caudal end of the hippocampus was determined from
the section in which the fornices were still detectable
in their full length The fornices were not however
included in the volume of the hippocampus We used
standard anatomical atlases of the human brain as
guidelines to determine the boundaries of the amygdala auld hippocampus on oblique coronal MRI
sections The boundaries of the region of interest
were outlined by a trackball driven cursor The
number of voxels within the region was integrated
by using a program developed in house for standard
work console Every second 1 mm slice was included
in the analysis which reduced the number of slices
to 2023 for hippocampus We calculated the results
using normalized volumes of the amygdala and
hippocampus volume of the hippocampus the area
of both hemispheres in MRI taken at the level of the
anterior commissure 
The group and task difficulty effects and group 
difficulty interaction were analyzed with repeated
measures ANOVA The t test one way ANOVA
and Bonferroni post hoc test and Wilcoxon signed
ranks tests were used

Hippocampal atrophy correlated with impaired
memory scoring in PD patients We also confirmed
previous evidence suggesting that dopaminergic dysfunction may cause impaired SWM and attentional
set shifting accuracy as the severity of motor symptoms correlated with these fronto striatal functions 2 3
Previous clinical and experimental results support
our finding that impaired memory performance in
DMTS and list learning tests in PD patients is at least
partly due to hippocampal dysfunction First humans
may employ verbal strategies to perform in the
DMTS test and actually form associations between
verbal cues and the sample figures employing a paired
associates learning strategy that requires hippocampal
processing 15 16 Second a supra span list learning
test and recall of these memory items after a delay
filled with distracting activity other cognitive tests 
depends on hippocampal processing 8 Indeed surgical
excision of the medial temporal lobe structures
during epilepsy and neurodegeneration in
Alzheimers disrupts list learning and
impairs the ability to retrieve the words from the
beginning of the list 8 19 However the defective
DMTS and word list test scoring may not be only
due to degeneration of the hippocampus as several
neurotransmitter systems are affected during the
progression of PD 5 For example dysfunction of
cholinergic cells of the basal forebrain or noradrenergic locus coeruleus may impair attention and certain
forms of declarative memory functions in more
advanced PD patients 5
Some non specific factor such as disease duration 
depression medication or age is unlikely to explain
the inferior delayed memory performance as the MI
severe PD patients did not differ in these measures
Hippocampal atrophy in demented Parkinsons disease patients

from the MU severe PD patient Furthermore no
correlation was observed between depression scoring 
dopaminergic medication disease duration or age and
memory performance 
In conclusion our present data described that
some PD patients that suffered from a severe motor
disability also had a delay dependent visual and
verbal memory failure that was associated with mild
atrophy of the hippocampus On the contrary the
defect in fronto striatal measures did not correlate
with the hippocampal atrophy but was related to the
severity of motor dysfunction This and earlier
evidence suggests that the dopamine cell loss in the
midbrain contributes for the defect in fronto striatal
functions in PD patients Furthermore failure of
memory retention occurs less frequently in PD
patients and this is at least to some extent due to
hippocampal dysfunction 
Conclusion
Parkinsons disease is characterized by impaired
function of fronto striatal loops that results from
loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra 
Impaired activity of the fronto striatal systems
disrupts spatial working memory planning and attentional set shifting at an early stage of the disease 
However some PD patients suffer from a retention
delay dependent impairment i e the longer the delay
is the worse memory of memory that is not likely
to result from dopaminergic dysfunction Our results
found that the severity of hippocampal atrophy
correlated with impaired memory accuracy in PD
patients
