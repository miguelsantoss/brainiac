and a disabling impact on quality of life 1 2 Pain is
reported already at the onset of the disease 3 it negatively affects rehabilitation strategies and increases relatives and caregivers burden 4 Nonetheless it is often
underrecognized and undertreated 5 6
Pain can occur as a consequence of dystonic muscle
contraction at the end of levodopa effect secondary to
comorbidities such as osteo arthrosis or disk herniation 7 and as a result of peripheral neuropathy 4 7
Indeed it is now evident that with advancing disease a
significant number of patients present abnormal nociceptive processing reporting a lower pain threshold

variably modulated by levodopa treatment regardless
of its aetiology 9 However pain does not constantly
improve with dopaminergic and may also
respond to other treatments including deep brain stimulation 11 suggesting that other supraspinal mechanisms not directly influenced by dopamine are
involved in its modulation 
The experience of pain is associated with psychological and neurophysiological responses and is processed
by a broad neural network which includes sensorydiscriminative motivational affective and cognitive
areas 12 13 Specific brain alterations are found in
several persistent pain conditions with a different
pathophysiology such as irritable bowel syndrome 
fibromyalgia headache or neuropathic pain Regions
found consistently involved are somatosensory areas 
the insula anterior cingulate cortex ACC prefrontal
cortex PFC thalamus Th and periaqueductal gray
matter 14 Some PFC Th Insula ACC and hippocampus are also linked to the pars compacta of substantia
nigra SNpc providing the neural bases for a PDspecific network involvement in pain processing 15
However to date there are no studies investigating
whether pain in PD is associated with structural alteration whereas functional imaging has confirmed the
role of the insula and ACC as well as prefrontal and
somatosensory cortices 10 18
Nonetheless the exact mechanisms of nociceptive
processing and modulation in PD remain unclear 19 In
this study we assessed both structural and functional
cerebral changes associated with persistent pain in PD

PD patients and healthy participants declaring no pain
or very little pain that did not interfere with normal

The 2 scales together can assess pain intensity frequency and its impact on daily activities Moreover 
the KPP has also been used in recent clinical trials to

To comprehensively evaluate the pain of the PD and
healthy participants we used the following 3 tools 
the KPP scale 20 21 a Visual Analogue Scale VAS 32
and Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and
Signs LANSS 33 The KPP scale is a validated comprehensive questionnaire and was chosen for its ability to
discriminate different types of pain and evaluate its
intensity and daily frequency 26 The scale has 7 domains investigating musculoskeletal chronic visceral 
nocturnal motor fluctuationrelated radicular and
oro facial pain during the last month One or more
items address every domain Higher scores are associated with more frequent or more intense pain 21 The
LANSS scale was developed to discriminate whether
pain had predominantly neuropathic features and it
includes 7 items investigating different symptoms such
as burning pain electroshock like pain pins and needles sensations and hyperalgesia Scores can range
from 0 to 24 and a score of 12 or higher indicates
that pain is likely to have a neuropathic origin 33

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses included between group comparisons of demographic and clinical variables of PD Pain
versus PD Ctrl groups Continuous and dichotomous
variables were compared among groups running nonparametric MannWhitney U and chi squared tests 
Pearson correlations were used to analyze the degree
of association between clinical demographic and neuropsychologic variables All statistics were performed
using SPSS version 20 IBM SPSS Chicago Illinois 
Between group differences for the cerebral GM
thickness and subcortical volumes were assessed by
general linear model GLM surface based analysis 
Statistical maps were generated using Freesurfers
QDEC 1 4 Query Design Estimate Contrast application QDEC fits a GLM at each surface vertex to
explain the data from all participants in the study 
The results were obtained with a full width half max
of 15 mm Age disease duration LEED and intracranial volume were used as covariates for each group 
We applied Monte Carlo nonparametric testing correcting for multiple comparisons across space for cerebral thickness For the cortical thickness analysis a
P  05 clusterwise Monte Carlo corrected threshold
was used and a P  005 uncorrected threshold was
used only for exploratory purposes A P  05 Sidak

correction for multiple comparisons across areas was
adopted for subcortical volumes 
For DTI we used the FSL tool Tract Based Spatial
Statistics TBSS 43 to compare diffusion measures
between PD patients subgroups including age disease
duration LEED and intracranial volume in the model as covariates for each group separately In addition 
fALFF GLM comparisons were performed voxel by
voxel between PD subgroups with the FSL randomize
tool 39 Statistical results for the DTI and fALFF were
corrected for multiple comparisons using the FSL randomize tool with 5000 permutations and the randomize option threshold free cluster enhancement
 TFCE 43 was applied with threshold at P  05 We
adopted a nonparametric permutation based FamilyWise Error FWE multiple correction This approach
has been indicated as adequate to minimize false positive findings 44
Finally nonparametric analysis of variance was run
among suprathreshold connections in the PD Pain 
PD Ctrl and pain free HC groups to rule out possible
brain alterations specific to PD but not related to
pain The F test for multiple comparisons was performed at the P  05 level of significance

Discussion
We investigated functional and structural brain correlates of persistent pain in PD using both an exhaustive clinical evaluation and neuroimaging techniques 
This is the first report linking a comprehensive clinical
assessment of persistent pain with anatomical and
functional neuroimaging 
Our data indicate that persistent pain in PD is associated with relative thinning in several brain areas
DLPFC Orbito Frontal Cortex OFC posterior Insular Cortex pIC and PCCand with local functional
alterations in the OFC and cerebellum Most structural alterations in the DLPFC OFC and pIC have been
reported in other chronic pain conditions 14
DLPFC is part of the mesocortical system and
receives dopamine projections from both the SN pars
compacta and the ventral tegmental area VTA 15 It
is a key area in the descending pain modulatory system 45 consistent with its role in expectation reward 
and decision making 46 The OFC is also well connected with the striatum and dopaminergic nuclei and
it is involved in expectation and rewards 47 The OFC
increases its activity to link several stimuli with their
subjective emotional and affective or during
pain inhibition 48 Posterior IC is considered a central
area for sensory integration receiving significant inputs from nociceptive and nonnociceptive fibers 49 It
forms the main sensory area for inputs from the spinothalamic pathway 49 pIC is also highly connected with
primary and secondary sensory areas in the parietal
lobe that are important during sensory discriminative
processing of inputs including nociception 50 Insular
Cortex IC is considered a central area for nonmotor
symptoms of PD patients Christopher and

 showed that the cortical thickness of the
IC is not related to patients cognitive status Taken
together our data confirm the relevance that the prefrontal insular cortex covers in pain conditions 
On the contrary to the best of our knowledge the
PCC is not associated with pain generation 52
although it may be activated during noxious stimulation 52 suggesting a role in the emotional evaluation of
stimuli PCC atrophy was found in AD but its role in
cognitive decline in PD is controversial 53 54 Our data
showed structural alterations of PCC associated with
pain and not with cognitive or psychological features 
Despite its unclear function the PCC is well connected
to the PFC and may link DLPFC and OFC and other
cortical regions possibly in association with the emotional evaluation that pain requires 55
Other very interesting results come from the functional MRI evaluation NBS analysis was based on
several ROIs chosen a priori and showed that a specific disconnection between the right NAc and the left

hippocampuswithin the aforementioned network
might cover a central role in persistent PD pain NAc
receives modulatory inputs by the hippocampus and
VTA 56 NAc has recently emerged as a key structure
in chronic and neuropathic pain Both animal and
human studies pointed out its role in the transition
from subacute to chronic and neuropathic pain 57 58 In
our study patients in the PD Pain group had both
chronic pain and neuropathic features and the alteration of reward feedback because of reduced NAc tohippocampus interaction is consistent with the clinical
presentation 
Other functional MRI studies used fALFF to present
local alterations in the OFC temporal areas and cerebellar circuits in PD Pain patients 59 Our data demonstrate that OFC covers a major role in PD pain 
showing both structural and functional alterations 
The cerebellum receives projection from the basal ganglia and VTA and sends projections to a widespread
network including the frontal eg DLPFC motor 
somatosensory and parietal regions 60 Emerging evidence indicates that the cerebellum in PD presents specific structural changes and may be related to
nonmotor manifestations 61 Our results are also consistent with evidence demonstrating the functional
alteration of the right cerebellum and parietal regions
in the early onset of PD 59 The role of the lingual cortex and temporal areas in pain is less established 
They both have been classically ascribed to memory 
word processing and visual function Lingual gyrus
atrophy has been related to visual hallucination in
PD 62 and temporal pole hypotrophy to cognitive
decline 63
Our clinical assessments were comprehensive and
PD groups with and without pain were well comparable in demographic cognitive psychological and
motor aspects except for total LEDD which was
modestly lower in the PD Pain patients possibly
because of the greater prevalence of women Clinical
results are consistent with other neuroimaging evaluations We found no differences in WM or in the subcortical regions typically related to PDs motor and
cognitive impairment 64 We are confident the presented results express persistent pain and lingual and
temporal pole fALFF alterations that might therefore
be related to additional nonmotor features which may
be addressed by future studies Of note fMRI is highly variable within subjects and it may change under
different conditions eg in ON and OFF phases We
carefully assessed all patients in the ON state to
explain only those functional alterations that are
dependent on persistent pain and not related to motor
fluctuations 
We explored persistent pain with the KPP scale the
first specifically developed and validated for PD 5 21
We acknowledge that our sample size was not very

large but the prevalence of patients with persistent
pain without any previous peripheral cause that satisfied our criteria was relatively small Indeed our
cohort was identified after screening 188 patients and
the participants were carefully evaluated before inclusion Our data showed strong correlations across the
domains of KPP suggesting that common mechanisms
may be responsible for the persistence of various pain
manifestations All PD Pain patients reported positive
scores in at least 5 domains of Kings PD Pain scale 
confirming other published data that have showed a
high prevalence and variability of pain in PD 4
In conclusion we highlighted for the first time a network of brain regional alterations specifically associated to persistent pain in PD and not present in painfree patients with similar cognitive psychological and
clinical profiles We propose that the present network
is involved in pain processing regardless of its primary
manifestation Pain in PD is associated with distinct
regional alterations in dopaminergic areas such as the
OFCwhich presents both functional and structural
changesand PFC Other nondopaminergic areas
such as the pIC PCC parietal regions and cerebellum
also showed structural and functional changes that
might be related to sensory motor and emotional
responses to pain 
Further longitudinal studies are needed to improve
our understanding of the supraspinal mechanisms of
pain in PD Our data strongly recommend that future
research considers and controls for pain symptoms as
they are associated with important structural and
functional cerebral changes
