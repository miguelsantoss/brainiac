Background While most patients with mild cognitive
impairment MCI transition to Alzheimer disease AD 
others develop non AD dementia remain in the MCI state 
or improve 
Objective To test the following hypotheses smaller hip 
pocampal volumes predict conversion of MCI to AD 
whereas larger hippocampal volumes predict cognitive
stability and or improvement and patients with MCI who
convert to AD have greater atrophy in the hippocampal subfield and subiculum 
Design Prospective longitudinal cohort study 
Setting University of CaliforniaLos Angeles Alzhei 
mers Disease Research Center 
Patients We followed up 20 MCI subjects clinically and
neuropsychologically for 3 years 
AD MCI c 7 remained stable MCI nc and 7
improved MCI i Patients with MCI c had 9 smaller
left and 13 smaller right mean hippocampal volumes
compared with MCI nc patients Radial atrophy maps
showed greater atrophy of the subregion in MCI c 
Patients with MCI c had significantly smaller hippocampi than MCI i patients left 24 right 27 Volumetric analyses showed a trend for greater hippocampal
atrophy in MCI nc relative to MCI i patients eg 16 
volume loss After permutation tests corrected for multiple comparison the atrophy maps showed a significant
difference on the right Subicular differences were seen
between MCI c and MCI i patients and MCI nc and
MCI i patients Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed the group effect to be highly significant and independent of age hemisphere and Mini Mental State
Examination scores at baseline 
Main Outcome Measure Baseline regional hippocampal atrophy was analyzed with region of interest and
3 dimensional hippocampal mapping techniques 
Conclusions Smaller hippocampi and specifically 
and subicular involvement are associated with increased risk for conversion from MCI to AD Patients with
MCI i tend to have larger hippocampal volumes and relative preservation of both the subiculum and

transition to Alzheimer disease AD dementia with Lewy bodies or vascular dementia but some remain stable and others
improve 3 Reversible MCI may be due to depression adverse effects of medication hormonal changes or nonneurological conditions severe enough to affect cognition 4 Any
improvement in our ability to predict the
outcome of MCI would be invaluable for
counseling patients making therapeutic decisions and planning clinical trials 5

Most amnestic MCI patients have AD
pathology 6 7 In AD the pathology typically appears first in the entorhinal cortex followed by the hippocampus and later
the neocortex Hippocampal atrophy correlates strongly with Braak and Braak
pathological 9 and cognitive decline 8 10 11 and predates conversion to MCI
in the oldest old 85 years 12
The MCI outcomes correlate with annualized hippocampal atrophy rates The
annual atrophy rates for those who remain stable MCI nc is 2 8 and for those
who develop AD MCI c is 3 7 The latter is strikingly similar to the 3 5 to 4 0 
observed in AD 13 14 Some researchers have
found an association between smaller hippocampi and the observed annual conversion rate from MCI to AD 15 16 whereas oth

heterogeneity and variability in hippocampal volume may
partly explain these conflicting results 
We analyzed hippocampal atrophy in MCI with a region of interest technique and a new hippocampal 3 dimensional 3 D radial atrophy mapping assessing for subregional structural deformations The
technique has proved sensitive and reliable in several neurodegenerative 21 developmental 24 25 and 27 disorders as well as in normal brain and temporal lobe epilepsy 29
METHODS

nonuniformities due to magnetic field inhomogeneities were eliminated 32 Hippocampi were traced on contiguous coronal slices following a detailed well established protocol with high intrarater
and interrater reliability 33 When boundaries were ambiguous a
standard neuroanatomical atlas was consulted 34 Tracings included the hippocampus proper dentate gyrus and subiculum 
All traces were made in a blinded fashion with respect to the subjects age sex and cognitive outcome Region of interest volumetric data were extracted and analyzed statistically 
The hippocampal contours were split into top and bottom
components and transformed into 3 D parametric surface mesh
models with normalized spatial frequency of the surface points
within and across brain slices This step ensures precise comparison of anatomy between subjects and groups at each hippocampal surface point For each outcome group we performed group averaging of hippocampal representations and
recorded the variation between corresponding surface points 
A medial core central line threading down the long axis of the
hippocampus was computed for each hippocampus Hippocampal radial distance measures ie the distance from the medial core to each point on the hippocampal surface model were
estimated These values were used to generate individual distance maps that were combined across subjects to produce group
average distance maps for comparing surface morphology between the groups 21  summarizes these methods The

COMMENT
MCI c showed a distinct pattern of hippocampal atrophy from MCI nc and MCI i The magnetic resonance
imaging preconversion difference at baseline is atrophy
of the lateral edge of the hippocampal formation possibly corresponding to the subfield The baseline magnetic resonance imaging preconversion difference is atrophy of the lateral edge of the hippocampal formation 
possibly corresponding to the subfield As we expected the and subfields did not show differences between the 3 groups although a larger sample may
be needed to detect subtle differences The hippocampal subfield is particularly susceptible to neuronal
loss in early AD 36 One recent study demonstrated preferential CAI and subicular atrophy and relative sparing

of and subfields in the earliest pathologic AD stages Braak states I III 39
Using a computational anatomy approach similar to
ours Wang et and Csernansky et compared hippocampal volume and shape between subjects with
mild AD Clinical Dementia Rating Scale score 0 5 
and age matched control subjects Their hippocampal
deformation maps accurately distinguished subjects
with AD from healthy controls The AD group had
lateral edge atrophy in regions corresponding to the
 hippocampal subfield at baseline with spread to
the hippocampal head at follow up Further extending
their work we found greater involvement in MCI
patients who later developed AD We found strong correlations between greater atrophy and verbal memory
performance 
Some studies find that a proportion of MCI subjects
revert back to normal cognition when followed up longitudinally 3 To our knowledge ours is the first imaging
study that includes the whole spectrum of clinical outcomes of cognitive worsening improvement and stability Patients with reversible MCI seem to have and
subicular sparing and larger hippocampal volumes at baseline The precise etiology for the amnestic syndrome in
our MCI i patients remains obscure as we excluded patients with depression or any other illness that could contribute to cognitive decline Future studies focusing on
MCI i will help clarify its etiology

Our study has several limitations Despite the small
sample size we were able to demonstrate significant morphological differences between the groups A larger MCI
patient sample will better define hippocampal regions that
correlate best with cognitive outcomes and determine the
specificity and sensitivity of our methods in predicting cognitive outcome in patients with newly diagnosed MCI Without direct pathological validation the interpretation of the
subregional involvement remains arbitrary The subregional boundaries we used are similar to those proposed
by other research groups 42 43 Nevertheless what we interpret as or subicular involvement may reflect changes
in another hippocampal subregion Our study focused on
amnestic MCI Our findings cannot be generalized to all
MCI patients especially to those with the nonamnestic subtype A large prospective study that follows up patients with
all MCI subtypes over time is needed to address the etiological clinical and prognostic questions that remain unanswered
