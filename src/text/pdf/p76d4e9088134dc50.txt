Introduction
Mild cognitive impairment MCI is dened as abnormal
cognitive state but does not meet the criteria for the
diagnosis of dementia In the past MCI was treated as a
transitional state between the physiological aging and
dementia Currently it is a separate diagnosis although it
is considered that MCI is a stage of pathophysiological
process of AD 1 Patients with MCI do not have problems
with function in daily life sometimes they only need
minimal aid 2 Patient diagnosed with MCI can present
stable non progressive symptoms until the end of his life 
but there can also be observed progression of the disease
 usually gradual leading to the development of dementia It
is estimated that the percentage of the conversion to
Alzheimers disease AD is about 1015 per year 3 
Criteria for diagnosis of MCI from 2011 1 in addition to
core clinical criteria distinguish research criteria The
research criteria include an assessment of the biological
markers of neurons injury namely 
 markers of b amyloid Ab deposition by assessing the levels
of in cerebrospinal uid or PET amyloid imaging
 markers of neuronal injury by evaluating the levels of total
and phosphorylated tau protein or a reduction in hippocampal volume or atrophy of the medial temporal lobe in the
magnetic resonance imaging or hypometabolism in FDGPET or hypoperfusion in SPECT 
These criteria are important because pathophysiological
process of AD can last even twenty years before onset of
clinical symptoms and MCI is considered as a stage of this
pathophysiological processes following the preclinical phase
of Alzheimers disease In MCI phase biomarkers should be
already positive both markers of Ab deposition and markers of
neuronal injury A sensitive biomarker will play key role when
causative treatment of AD will be found because then it will be
possible to treat this disease even before the onset of clinical
symptoms 
The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of
structural brain magnetic resonance imaging with volumetric
assessment of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex 
posterior cingulate gyrus parahippocampal gyrus temporal
gyri superior medial and inferior to predict the conversion of
MCI to AD 
The rst abnormalities in patients who are at risk of AD are
positive markers of deposition of b amyloid decreased Ab
concentration in the cerebrospinal uid and or positive PET
amyloid imaging In this study the marker of neuronal injury
was used  structural MRI with volumetric assessment of
selected brain structures inter alia hippocampus entorhinal
cortex because of good availability of magnetic resonance in
Poland the best of neuroimaging biomarkers and its noninvasive nature Furthermore according to Jack in the MRI
pathological changes are observed as one of the last
biomarkers 4 and our patients were not in the preclinical
phase  they were diagnosed with MCI Reduction of the
measured volumes was expected in patients who were at risk
of conversion to AD 
Material and methods
In the study initially participated 163 patients diagnosed with
MCI who were evaluated in Alzheimers Department of MSW
Hospital in Warsaw 101 patients remained for further data
analysis due to lack of follow up visits or errors in MRI which
precluded further analysis of the data The patients were aged
5080 years mean age 62 7 Neurological assessment MMSE
 Mini Mental State Examination CDT clock drawing test and
GDS Global Deterioration Scale were performed The average
score of MMSE was 27 4 30 range 2530 points The average
score of CDT was 8 5 10 points range 610 points and the
mean score of GDS 2 7 points range 23 points Laboratory
tests included morphology TSH blood glucose urea creatinine transaminases VDRL veneral disease research laboratory levels of vitamin and folic acid and there was no
signicant abnormalities Each patient was assessed using
standard neuropsychological tests according to the standards
described by Gabryelewicz 5 On CDR scale Clinical Dementia
Rating all patients received 0 5 or 0 0 5 For each patient 
follow up visits were scheduled after 6 months 14 days 12
months 30 days and 24 months 50 days Then patients
were again evaluated neurologically included MMSE CDT GDS
assessment Neuropsychological examination was performed
to assess potential disease progression In patients diagnosed
with conversion to AD acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment
was initiated All patients remain under the care of the Memory
Disorders Outpatient Clinic of MSW Hospital in Warsaw 
Brain MRI was performed for each of the patients on a 1 5 T
Toshiba apparatus in the Department of Radiology of MSW
Hospital Scans were obtained in weighted FLAIR DWI
images and also thin 3D Alzheimer sequence Using
FreeSurfer software volumes of selected structures were
calculated that is hippocampus entorhinal cortex posterior
cingulate gyrus parahippocampal gyrus temporal gyri superior medial inferior and total intracranial volume Subsequently the results have been checked by the same radiologist
to detect and eliminate possible errors which may arise in the
process of segmentation Each volume hippocampus entorhinal cortex posterior cingulate gyrus parahippocampal
gyrus temporal gyri superior medial inferior was divided
by the total intracranial volume to normalize results and to
make possible comparison between patients and eliminate
differences in the brain size according to Whitwell 6 All
volumes were multiplied by 1000 in order to facilitate
comparison between them

two variables was statistically signicant Sensitivity of the
measurements of the left hippocampus and left entorhinal
cortex in the prediction of MCI progression to AD was 58 8 
Sensitivity for these measurements in predicting the stable
form of MCI was the same as using all the measured
parameters namely 96 4 and diagnosis classication accuracy using left hippocampus and left entorhinal cortex was
90 for all measurements 91 The highest sensitivity in
predicting MCI conversion to AD using a single measurement
was for left hippocampus 52 9 right hippocampus 41 2 
and left entorhinal cortex 41 2 
Discussion
In descriptive statistics presented in Table 2 average
volumes of all structures are smaller in converters comparing
to non converters according to the preliminary assumptions However statistical analysis showed the superiority of
some measurements The highest sensitivity of conversion
for single structure was obtained for the left hippocampus
 52 9 right hippocampus 41 2 and left entorhinal cortex
 also 41 2 Unsuitable measurements for assessing MCI to
AD conversion were the volumes of left and right posterior
cingulate gyrus left and right superior temporal gyrus and
right medial temporal gyrus the sensitivity was 0 Our
results are consistent with the sequence of neuropathological
changes described by Braak 7 8 where entorhinal cortex and
hippocampus are affected as the rst by the neuropathological process and subsequently cortex of temporal lobes in
stage III and IV Volumes of superior temporal gyri proved to
be unsuitable probably because of their main role in the
process of auditory sensation so their role in cognitive
processes is signicantly lower The most of the published
studies has evaluated usefulness of hippocampus and
entorhinal cortex volumes in the prediction of MCI conversion to AD Our study also conrms the highest value of these
two parameters Studies which assessed additionally for
example volume of parahippocampal gyrus indicated that
the use of this parameter did not increase prediction
sensitivity for conversion to AD 9 10 In our study the use
of all measured volumes increased sensitivity from 58 8 
 where the volume of the left hippocampus and left
entorhinal cortex was used to 64 7 Specicity in both
cases was 96 4 Signicant differences between the sensitivity and specicity gures resulted from subgroup size
difference 17 converters and 84 with stable MCI In other
studies the percentage of conversion to AD was higher 
namely 2745 911 In the few studies 10 12 13 the most
sensitive volumetric measurement was entorhinal cortex
volume In our study left entorhinal cortex volume was less
sensitive measurement in comparison with left hippocampus volume as in the Ewers work 14 Patients with MCI are
a heterogeneous group and may be at different stages of
neuropathological process that is why use of hippocampus
and entorhinal cortex volumes seems be the most optimal
method Volumetric measurements of hippocampus entorhinal cortex posterior cingulate gyrus parahippocampal
gyrus and temporal gyri superior medial inferior showed a
relatively low sensitivity in predicting the conversion of MCI
to AD in the analysis of all measurements 64 7 Higher
sensitivity was obtained for predicting stable MCI 96 4 
The limitation of our study was the number of patients
 101 Studies which drew from either ADNI database the
Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative or AddNeuroMed program present the results from signicantly larger
groups of patients For example Risacher et al 15 analyzed
339 patients with MCI from ADNI database 18 3 converted
into AD per year Bilateral hippocampal volumes entorhinal
cortex and temporal gyri thickness were signicantly reduced
in MCI converters in comparison to the MCI stable participants which is consistent with our results except for the left
superior temporal gyrus LSTG Table 3 In our study the
volume of LSTG was not signicantly lower but in Risarcher
study the thickness not volume of temporal gyri was
measured Another study 16 based on ADNI database Li
et al covered 293 patients with MCI and the observation
period lasted 4 years To predict conversion from MCI to AD the
authors used not only the measured volumes but also
demographic genetic information cognitive scores and the
results of laboratory tests They employed a hierarchical
interaction model to select the most predictive biosignatures
and interactions between all of the parameters to perform
correct classication the patients with MCI converter or nonconverter The accuracy of classication was almost 75 the
most effective MRI parameters were precuneus amygdala 
entorhinal cortex and hippocampus Percentage of the correct
classication in our study using all volumes was 91 but
sensitivity was only 64 7 Higher correct classication rate
in our study was probably due to the large differences between
subgroups 17 converters vs 84 non converters In Lis study
conversion rate was 45 132 converters vs 161 nonconverters so subgroups were almost equivalent 
The study from 2014 17 presents results using data from
both mentioned databases ADNI and AddNeuroMed and
involved 345 patients with MCI The authors used ordinal
regression model to 1023 baseline structural MRI scans They
modeled all classes simultaneously in study were also AD
patients and control group and applied multivariate ordinal
regression from which they extract a probabilistic prediction
of class membership and an index of AD progression  the
ORCHID score Classication accuracy was 7075 ADNIAddNeuroMed sensitivity of 77 and specicity of 72 
This study conrmed results from 2011 18 in which
multivariate classication methods for MRI was used Data
was from AddNeuroMed database MCI group was 101 patients
 like in our study and 19 patients converted into AD during
one year observation The authors compared correct classication accuracy between visual assessment rating scales a
multivariate MRI classication method with using regional
volume and regional cortical thickness measures providing 57
variables for multivariate analysis and manually measured
hippocampal volumes The best accuracy for predicting
conversion was for the model with automated regional MRI
measures  79 and 68 accuracy was obtained to other two
methods Comparable group size with our study proved that
using sophisticated statistical tools can improve the efciency
of the method 
Our study group requires further observation because in
the following years the proportion of the patients who
