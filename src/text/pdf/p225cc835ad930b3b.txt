Abstract 
Background The influence of neuroinflammation on neuronal function and hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimers disease
 AD and Parkinsons disease dementia PDD is still unclear 
Objectives Here we investigated whether microglial activation measured by 11 C PET is associated with neuronal
function measured by cerebral glucose metabolic rate rCMRGlc using FDG PET and hippocampal volume measurements 
Methods We enrolled 25 subjects 9 PDD 8 AD and 8 controls who underwent PET scans with 11 C R 
18 FFDG and volumetric MRI scanning 
Results SPM correlation analysis in AD and PDD showed a negative correlation between hippocampal volume and microglial
activation within hippocampus or parahippocampus and with cortical and subcortical areas of projections from hippocampus 
while there was a positive correlation between rCMRGlc in cortical and subcortical areas of projections from hippocampus
and hippocampal volume Hippocampal volume was significantly reduced in AD compared to controls but not in PDD 
Conclusions These findings indicate that microglial activation inversely correlated with hippocampal volume and hippocampal rCMRGlc in neurodegenerative diseases with dementia providing further evidence for the central role of microglial
activation in neurodegenerative diseases

neuroinflammation plays a significant role in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimers disease
 AD and Parkinsons disease dementia PDD 
whether neuroinflammation is associated with local
and distant neuronal damage is still not being investigated Microglial cells are the resident macrophages
of the central nervous system CNS they represent around 10 of the CNS population and play a
crucial role in first line of immune defense in case
of any kind of brain injury They have the capability to phagocyte toxic products release cytotoxic

factors and can be antigen presenting cells 1 In
absence of foreign stimuli microglial cells are in a
resting state or inactivated however with ramified morphology microglia can scan close regions
and their environment without interfering with neurons and neuronal activities and can monitor the brain
parenchyma every few hours When activated they
go through morphological changes converting their
shape to an activated amoeboid and mobile one able
to reach the site of injury 2 These cells can remain
for a long time in the activated phenotype releasing
cytokines and neurotoxic agents that can worsen CNS
damage 3 The acute CNS inflammatory response
to an injury mediated by microglia can be protective 
however chronic inflammatory activity can be selfsustaining beyond physiological usefulness resulting
in damage to the affected tissues 4 In AD  fibrils
activate microglia and it is supported by the presence of microglia around the plaques while in PDD 
activated microglia is associated with  synuclein 
Microglial activation as visualized by PET scans
using the radioligand 11 C R that targets
the translocator protein TSPO is present in patients
with AD and PD 5 6 It has also been shown that
there is a strong association with amyloid deposition
in AD 7 
Cerebral glucose metabolic rate rCMRGlc measured by 18 FFDG PET is measure of glucose
utilization and is suggested to be an indirect measure of synaptic function Hippocampal atrophy is
a characteristic feature of AD and it is established
that accelerated hippocampal atrophy is associated
with disease progression 8 The presence of hippocampal atrophy in PDD is more variable some
groups have reported hippocampal atrophy in PD at
an early stage of the disease 912 while others
were not able to replicate those findings 13 Here 
we hypothesized that regional and distant microglial
activation is associated with hippocampal volume
loss in subjects with AD and PDD and this could
be associated with reduction in rCMRGlc Our aim
was to investigate whether increased hippocampal 
medial temporal lobe or whole cortex glial activation where hippocampal neurons projects directly or
indirectly correlates with hippocampal volume loss
and reduction in glucose metabolism in hippocampus
and medial temporal lobe structures In this study 
we evaluated glial activation using 11 C
PET and rCMRGlc using 18 FFDG PET with arterial input Hippocampal volume was measured from
 volumetric MRI in patients with AD PDD and
age matched control subjects 
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
Twenty five subjects nine PDD eight AD and
eight controls were recruited from Imperial College London Healthcare NHS Trust and associated
hospitals in London All subjects had detailed clinical and neurological assessments including collateral
history as required bloods and detailed neuropsychometric evaluation assessing verbal and visual memory attention executive functions visuoconstruction 
language and recognition memory Subjects were
diagnosed as clinically probable AD based on the
NINDS ADRDA criteria 14 Diagnosis of PDD was
based on the diagnostic algorithm for PDD 15 where
patients had a diagnosis of PD for at least 1 year
before the onset of dementia The inclusion criteria for
patients were 1 age 5080 years 2 clinical diagnosis of AD or PDD before they enrolled in the study 
 3 adequate visual and auditory acuity to complete
the neuropsychometric testing 4 a reliable caregiver
who could provide information about the patients
clinical symptoms and 5 ability to provide informed
consent Exclusion criteria were the presence of 1 
extensive white matter microvascular disease on MRI
which was over and above the lacunes associated with
normal aging 2 major depression based on DSMIV criteria 3 a current or recent history of drug or
alcohol abuse dependence 4 any significant disease
or unstable medical condition that could influence
neuropsychological testing 5 pregnancy 6 any
contraindications to MRI 7 a history of schizophrenia schizoaffective disorder bipolar disorder or any
history of electroconvulsive therapy and 8 history
of cancer within the past 5 years except localized
skin and prostate cancer Dementia was excluded in
control subjects by detailed clinical examination and
neuropsychometric tests None of the enrolled subjects had diabetes or chronic kidney disease stage 3
and above Two AD and one PDD subjects suffered
from ischemic heart disease None of the enrolled
volunteers was on treatment for acute or chronic systemic inflammatory diseases All patients underwent
PET scans with 11 C PET and 18 FFDG
PET with arterial input as well as volumetric MRI
scanning after obtaining regulatory approval from
the Ethics Committee of the Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust Permission to administer radiotracers
was obtained from the Administration of Radioactive
Substances Advisory Committee ARSAC UK The
work described has been carried out in accordance
G D Femminella et al Hippocampal Volume and Neuroinammation
with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki and written informed
consent was obtained by all participants All subjects
were age matched AD and PDD subjects under 80
years 
MRI and PET scanning
MRI scanning
MRI scans were performed with a 1 5 Tesla GE
scanner volumetric MRI 3D volume pulse
sequence RF Fast acquisition times TR 30 ms TE
3 ms flip angle 30 FOV 25 cm matrix 156 
256 voxel dimensions 0 98  0 98  1 6 mm were
acquired for co registration of PET scans and assessment of atrophy while weighted images were
acquired to rule out any structural abnormality in AD 
PDD and control subjects 
Evaluation of hippocampal volume using
FreeSurfer
Automated hippocampal segmentation was
done using 1 0 http surfer nmr mgh 
harvard edu The stages of FreeSurfers volumebased subcortical stream are as fully described
before 16 17 Briefly an affine registration with
Talairach space is followed by an initial volumetric
labeling and correction for variation in intensity due
to the biasfield After this a high dimensional
nonlinear volumetric alignment to the Talairach
atlas is performed followed by pre processing and
finally the volume is labeled Hippocampal volume
was calculated by multiplying the number of voxels
by the voxel volume 
PET scanning
11 C R PET All subjects underwent
three dimensional 11 C R PET using an
ECAT EXACT HR CTI Siemens 966 scanner
where a mean dose of 296 18 MBq was injected 
and 3D emission data was acquired in listmode over
60 min Parametric images of 11 C R 
binding potential BPND reflecting Bmax Kd were
generated with a simplified tissue reference two
brain compartmental model SRTM As AD and
PDD subjects have a widespread distribution of
pathological changes no single region free of disease
can be identified as a reference for non specific tracer
binding This is due to the fact that 1 immunocytochemical study indicated TSPO is present in the
cerebellum 18 2 TSPO is also present in arteries 
meninges choroid plexus and in the ependymal
cells thus specific signal could be affected by the
anatomical reference region even in healthy control
subjects and 3 with arterial input analysis we have
demonstrated that there is signal in cerebellum in
AD subjects Cluster analysis was therefore used
to extract and identify a distributed cluster of voxels
that mirrored a normal population cortical reference
input function for each individual subject controls 
AD and PDD We have introduced this computational methodology that enables the extraction of a
reference cluster from 11 C R dynamic
PET studies 18 The algorithm matches the time
activity curve TAC of each pixel to the kinetics
of six pre defined tissues normal grey and normal
white matter skull muscle grey matter with reactive
microglia vasculature that is rich in the receptor
in endothelial cells and smooth muscles obtained
from a database of control subjects and patients 
The reference TAC is calculated as the population
average of normal grey matter The clustering code
is implemented in the software package SUPERPK

written in Matlab The Mathworks Inc Natick MA 
The use of an appropriate reference not only increases
the sensitivity of the quantification procedure to the
specific signal from microglia but also minimizes
the sensitivity of the calculated binding potential
 BPND obtained by the modeling procedure to
changes in blood flow Our unit has validated the use
of the SRTM with a reference input function defined
by cluster analysis as the most reproducible and
sensitive technique for generating BPND maps 19 
18 FFDG PET All subjects underwent 18 FFDGPET scans using a Siemens ECAT EXACT HR
scanner Subjects were asked to fast for 4 h before
the injection of 18 FFDG 186  8 MBq The FDG
dynamic emission scan was acquired over 60 min
with continuous online whole blood sampling for the
first 15 min while discrete whole blood and plasma
samples were taken at 5 10 15 20 30 40 50 and
60 min All subjects had radial artery cannulation and
fasting plasma glucose levels were measured at the
beginning and end of the scan Parametric maps of
absolute rCMRGlc were created by applying spectral analysis to brain time activity curves using an
arterial plasma input function 7 
Region of interest analysis
Region of interest ROI analysis was done for
parametric images of 11 C R BPND and
G D Femminella et al Hippocampal Volume and Neuroinammation
rCMRGlc Initially an individualized object map was
created for all the subjects using the following procedure Statistical parametric mapping software 
was used to spatially transform individual PET images
into their corresponding MRI space by 1 segmenting individual MRIs into grey matter white matter
and CSF 2 thresholding voxels with a 50 probability of containing grey matter to create individual
grey matter binarized images 3 transforming the
probabilistic atlas in standard MNI space into the individuals MRI space and 4 co registering individual
PET onto the corresponding MRI The grey matter
binarized image was then convolved with the atlas in
Analyze 11 to create an individualized object map 
Parametric images were then sampled for different
cortical and subcortical regions 
Statistical parametric mapping SPM analysis
SPM interrogation to localize mean differences
between patients and controls for 11 C R 
BPND and rCMRGlc in AD and PDD was
performed using Wellcome Department
of Imaging Neuroscience UCL London UK 
http www fil ion ucl ac uk spm The between group
comparison was performed at a voxel level with a
statistical threshold for significance set at p  0 01
and an extent threshold of 50 voxels as previously
described 20 All clusters with a corrected p  0 05
were considered to be significant 
Statistical analysis
As hippocampal neurons project to the entorhinal cortex which in turn projects to the whole of
cortex we anticipate that neuronal degeneration by
microglial activation follows the cortical connection
from hippocampus Thus to evaluate the relationship
between hippocampal volume and neuroinflammation in AD and PDD subjects pixel by pixel
correlation between microglial activation rCMRGlc
and hippocampal volumes was evaluated using SPM
where pixel wise BPND of 11 C R PET
and rCMRGlc were the dependent variable and the
hippocampal volume scores or hippocampal rCMRGlc were the covariate of interest 
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS
22 in Windows 7 SPSS Chicago Illinois USA 
Continuous variables were expressed as mean  SD 
Normality was assessed using the KolmogorovSmirnov test One way ANOVA was used to compare
the three groups followed by Bonferroni post hoc
correction The statistical interrogations of the ROI
data for glial activation and glucose metabolism
between AD and PDD versus controls was done with
two tailed t test in with a significance of
p  0 05 We evaluated the major cortical regions like
frontal lobe temporal lobe parietal lobe and occipital lobe As medial temporal lobe and hippocampus
are specifically involved in memory and neuroinflammation we did a detailed analysis of medial
temporal lobe and hippocampus As anterior and posterior cingulate are implicated in amyloid deposition
and reduction in glucose metabolism respectively we
subsequently analyzed anterior cingulate posterior
cingulate thalamus and striatum Categorical variables were compared by 2 test 
We have evaluated hippocampal volumetric
measurements against 11 C R BPND and
rCMRGlc in hippocampus medial temporal lobe 
and whole cortex and Spearmans correlation was
employed by virtue of the limited sample size and
a p  0 05 was considered as statistically significant 
Correlations between Mini Mental State Examination MMSE scores 11 C R BPND 
rCMRGlc and hippocampal volume were analyzed
with Spearmans correlation and a p  0 05 was considered as statistically significant

DISCUSSION
In this study we have demonstrated for the first
time that levels of microglial activation at voxel level
in the whole cortex medial temporal lobe and hip 
pocampus measured using 11 C R PET 
were inversely correlated with hippocampal volume
and hippocampal glucose uptake in AD and PDD
subjects This study provides further credence to the
hypothesis that microglial activation detected with
11 C R PET is correlated with markers
of neuronal damage as reduction in hippocampal
volume and glucose metabolism This finding further supports the role of neuroinflammation and
microglial activation in neurodegenerative diseases
5 7 2022 The spatial agreement between local
and distant microglial activation in the cortical projections and atrophy in hippocampus lends credence
to the theory that chronically activated microglial
cells might be one of the effectors of neurodegenerative processes thus influencing neuroinflammation
can have potential therapeutic implications in these
diseases In this study we have found increased
levels of 11 C R BPND across almost

Growing evidence indicates that neuroinflammation contributes significantly to the pathological
process in chronic neurodegenerative diseases and
this could act independently and along with the
other pathological substrates in neurodegenerative
diseases In AD microglial cells are activated by
amyloid deposition generating a proinflammatory
response leading to neuronal death The damaged
neurons and neurofibrillary tangles can in turn activate microglia inducing a vicious cycle of neuronal
damage and reactive gliosis 23 In PD findings
from neuropathological studies have shown that
microglial cells are associated with  synucleinpositive Lewy neurites 24 and that misfolded
 synuclein released from neurons can directly activate microglial cells In PDD according to Braak and
colleagues the spread of Lewy body pathology starts
from dorsal motor nucleus of vagus and olfactory
nucleus then reaches substantia nigra basal forebrain and ultimately the sensory association areas
and premotor areas of the neocortex Thus it could
be implied that neuroinflammation triggered by Lewy
body pathology follows the same temporal spatial
progression which in turn could lead to neuronal
damage both in anterograde and retrograde fashion 
Moreover it has been demonstrated that microglial
activation may lead to synaptic dysfunction and loss
of dopaminergic axonal projections with retrograde
neurodegeneration 25 26 In this study we have
shown that microglial activation locally and in the
cortical projections from hippocampus could cause
neuronal damage and hippocampal atrophy which is
novel and has never been demonstrated before 
It should also be mentioned that microglial cells
in brain express different phenotypes depending on
the type of proinflammatory stimuli received either
via paracrine or autocrine manner 27 The cytokine
stimulation is essential for microglial polarization
into the classically activated or the phenotype which is activated by the alternate pathway
28 In AD it has also been demonstrated that dysfunctional microglial response could contribute to A
accumulation 29 As AD pathology worsens there
is a switch from to phenotype consistent with
the idea that microglia become less responsive to 
induction signals as they age 3032 In our study 
we cannot discern whether glial activation detected
by 11 C R PET might be mainly due to
either of the two phenotypes However microglial
activation detected by 11 C R PET is associated with hippocampal volume loss and correlated
with MMSE suggesting the putative effect of the
microglial cells as described before 
G D Femminella et al Hippocampal Volume and Neuroinammation
It is known that other factors can affect neuroinflammation such as the activity of the central
adrenergic system As an example multiple lines
of evidence indicate that the adrenergic neurotransmitter norepinephrine also exerts anti inflammatory
actions within the CNS In transgenic AD mouse
models with locus coeruleus the major source
of noradrenergic projections degeneration the
decrease of norepinephrine has shown to induce
the inflammatory reaction of microglial cells in AD
and to exacerbate neuroinflammation induced by the
deposition of amyloid 3335 
In this study we have also demonstrated that hippocampal volume in AD and PDD subjects is directly
correlated with reduction in glucose metabolism at
voxel level This finding is in accordance with previous evidence which have shown that patients with
AD and PDD have extensive areas of cerebral atrophy and hypometabolism in comparison with control
subjects Vander Borght et al compared AD and PDD
subjects matched for dementia severity finding similar metabolic reductions both globally and regionally 
however PDD exhibited greater metabolic reduction in the occipital cortex but relatively preserved
metabolism in the medial temporal lobe compared
to AD FDG PET studies in AD have indicated that
glucose metabolic deficits start from the hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex and then involve
the temporo parietal cortices 36 In this study we
have been able to demonstrate a similar pattern of
hypometabolism and increase in microglial activation
on those regions 
Recent data have demonstrated that in PD patients
with mild cognitive impairment hypometabolism
exceeds atrophy in the angular gyrus occipital orbital and anterior frontal lobes 37 In
PDD patients the hypometabolic areas observed in
PD patients with mild cognitive impairment were
replaced by areas of atrophy which were surrounded
by extensive zones of hypometabolism areas where
atrophy extended more than hypometabolism were
found in the precentral and supplementary motor
areas in both patients with mild cognitive impairment
and with PDD and in the hippocampus and temporal
lobe in patients with PDD 
These data are also in accordance with our findings 
First of all while we found significant hippocampal atrophy in AD subjects we were not able to
detect any significant differences in hippocampal volume between PDD and controls Previous reports
evaluating hippocampal volume in PD and PDD
patients showed conflicting results Some authors
have reported hippocampal atrophy even at early
stages of the disease while others have not found
significant differences compared to age matched controls 913 Although mixed AD PD pathology can
be present in our study population our PDD patients
did not show significant hippocampal atrophy compared to age matched controls Our AD group also
showed occipital hypometabolism which more commonly is observed in PDD however this finding has
been observed in works from our studies and others
3840 Unlike other studies our measurement of
rCMRGlc was quantitative and absolute as we used
the arterial input for the FDG PET scans 
We evaluated the correlation between microglial
activation in the hippocampus and cortical regions
where death of neuronal projections direct and indirect from the hippocampus could influence the level
of microglial activation due to the death of the neurons in the medial temporal lobe and neocortical
regions as microglial activation and neuronal death
in the hippocampus could lead to microglial activation in the projected neurons The hippocampal fibers
are connected directly to the entorhinal cortex and
from there project on to perirhinal parahippocampal cortices and widely to the cortex This correlation
suggests that microglial activation could cause neuronal damage in the immediate vicinity as well as
at distant regions connected indirectly from the hippocampus It is suggested that this could be due
to the loss of afferent and efferent fibers from the
hippocampal neurons while cortical microglial activation independent of hippocampal denervation is
also a possibility This phenomenon is also reported
in stroke 41 
Indeed in our cohort hippocampal atrophy in AD
group seems to correlate well with neuroinflammation within the hippocampus and in regions of
direct or indirect cortical projections It is known
that enthorinal cortex within the medial temporal lobe
is connected both via afferent and efferent neuronal
pathways to hippocampus Moreover the enthorinal
cortex is also connected to a variety of cortical and
subcortical regions amygdala olfactory bulb cingulate cortex temporal cortex and the orbital cortex
 along with other frontal and parietal regions Thus 
it is conceivable that neuroinflammation in the hippocampus could lead to neuronal dysfunction locally
and remotely in connected cortical areas possibly
leading to neurodegeneration and atrophy Fig 2 
It could also be argued that microglial activation
in cortical areas of hippocampal projection might
lead to neuroinflammation and atrophy within the
G D Femminella et al Hippocampal Volume and Neuroinammation
hippocampus It is likely that both these processes
might happen in AD pathology leading to a vicious
cycle of neurodegeneration Interestingly our data
set demonstrated that hippocampal volume correlated
significantly to the reduction in rCMRGlc and to the
increase in microglial activation in AD in wider in
terms of voxel volume brain regions compared to
PDD suggesting that for comparable cognitive status the underlying microglial activation and reduction in rCMRGlc is spatially more widespread in AD
than PDD and accordingly significant atrophy has set
in AD but not in PDD Similarly we have found that
the reduction in hippocampal glucose metabolism in
AD is associated with wider areas of increased glial
activation compared to PDD This could suggest that
cognitive dysfunction in PDD is also contributed by
other factors like presence of  synuclein 
The neuropsychometric assessment of the study
population indicated that the AD group achieved significantly lower scores than PDD in immediate and
delayed memory recall This is partially in accordance with previous studies that have shown that 
for comparable MMSE levels AD and PDD patients
perform differently on memory attention and executive functions even at early stages of the disease 42 
43 This could be due to the different neuropathological substrate which in AD affects primarily the
medial temporal cortex and the neocortical association areas while in PD neurodegeneration starts
in the brain stem and subsequently spreads to the
cortical areas In the present study we have also
found significant negative correlations between cognitive profile as measured by MMSE scores versus
11 C R BPND and a positive correlation
between MMSE score versus hippocampal volume 
and MMSE scores versus rCMRGlc further suggesting the putative effect of microglial activation in late
stage of the disease 44 45 
The findings of this study are limited by the small
number of subjects per group and by the crosssectional design however this proof of principle
study sheds more light into the role of neuroinflammation and how this influences the neurodegenerative process Also the use of multiple comparisons
might increase the risk of false positive inferences
 type I error we have reduced this error by applying
correction for multiple comparisons in our regression analysis 11 C R PET though used
for many years as a selective marker of microglial
activation via binding to the upregulated TPSO
protein shows in vivo binding 1 orders of magnitude lower than second generation TPSO tracers like
11 C It has been shown that the rate of clearance of 11 C R is considerably faster than
many other widely used PET radioligands leading to
a very low ratio of specific to non specific binding It
is also suggested that the fraction of non specifically
bound 11 C R in the grey matter is about
60 However reproducibility studies with 11 C R have shown that the tracer binding in large
brain regions was acceptable for applied clinical studies 46 Future studies with second generation TSPO
markers may be able to extend these results further in
other neurodegenerative diseases However secondgeneration tracers are influenced by the TSPO polymorphism Moreover although 11 C R is
generally considered as a specific marker for activated microglial cells several studies have suggested
that this tracer also binds to reactive astrocytes in
brain 4749 Another limitation of the present
study is that the observed correlations between hippocampal volume and 11 C R BPND at the
ROI level were not evident when the groups were
analyzed separately Although we cannot exclude
that this is just simply attributable to differences
between groups there was no significant difference
between microglial activation between these two
groups However we were only able to evaluate small
numbers of subjects as enrolment of a larger number
of subjects was limited by the intensity of scanning
involved in this study Previous reports from our
group have shown that a correlation exists between
MMSE scores and cortical microglial activation at a
voxel level using SPM analysis both in AD subjects
and PDD subjects separately 38 
In conclusion we have shown that glial activation within the hippocampus as assessed by
11 C R PET inversely correlates with hippocampal volume in neurodegenerative diseases with
dementia These findings provide further evidence
for the central role of microglial activation in
neurodegenerative pathologies like AD and PDD 
and highlights microglial activation as a potential
therapeutic target in combating chronic neuroinflammation and resultant neurodegeneration
