Article abstractObjective To compare global and regional atrophy on MRI in subjects with dementia with Lewy bodies
 DLB AD vascular dementia VaD and normal aging In addition the relationship between APOE 4 genotype and
volumetric indices was examined Method MRI based volume measurements of the whole brain ventricles frontal lobe 
temporal lobe hippocampus and amygdala were acquired in elderly subjects with DLB n  27 mean age  75 9 years 
AD n  25 77 2 years VaD n  24 76 9 years and normal control subjects n  26 76 2 years Results Subjects with
DLB had significantly larger temporal lobe hippocampal and amygdala volumes than those with AD No significant
volumetric difference between subjects with DLB and VaD was observed Compared with control subjects ventricular
volumes were increased in all patients with dementia though those with DLB showed a relative preservation of wholebrain volume There were no significant differences in frontal lobe volumes between the four groups APOE 4 status was
not associated with volumetric indices Conclusion The findings support the hypothesis that DLB is associated with a
relative preservation of temporal lobe structures In the differentiation of DLB and AD this may have important

Dementia with Lewy bodies DLB is characterized
by fluctuating cognitive impairment persistent visual hallucinosis and parkinsonism It is the second
most common form of degenerative dementia and
may account for up to 20 of cases of late life dementia 1 Ante mortem diagnosis of DLB and its differentiation from other common forms of late onset
dementias particularly AD and vascular dementia
 VaD is important for a number of reasons Some
patients with DLB may have an accelerated disease
progression and approximately 50 of subjects experience life threatening adverse reactions to antipsychotic medications neuroleptic sensitivity 2 In
contrast subjects with DLB may have an enhanced
therapeutic response to treatment with cholinesterase inhibitors 3
Volumetric MRI may provide important supplementary information that could support or counter a

clinical diagnosis of DLB A recent volumetric 
and initial work from our 6 indicate that there
may be less atrophy of temporal lobe structures on
MRI in DLB compared with AD Information regarding
other structural features that may differentiate DLB
from AD are inconclusive and there has been no detailed volumetric comparison of DLB and VaD to date 
A number of recent studies reported an association between the APOE 4 genotype and specific
morphologic changes identified on neuroimaging in
subjects with AD 7 No consistent link has been
identified and the relationship between volumetric
indices on MRI and APOE 4 status in DLB has not
been characterized 
The purpose of this study was to compare the extent of global and regional atrophy on MRI in patients with DLB AD and VaD and age comparable
normal control subjects We also examined the relationship between APOE 4 status and volumetric indices in these subjects We hypothesized that
subjects with DLB would have less temporal lobe
atrophy than those with AD and VaD 
Methods Recruitment of subjects Seventy six subjects
over age 60 years who fulfilled Diagnostic and Statistical
Manual of Mental Disorders 4th Edition DSM IV 12 criteria for dementia were recruited from a communitydwelling population of patients with an informant in
regular contact Seventy two of these subjects were prospectively chosen from a clinical case of consecutive referrals to old age psychiatry services All potential
subjects on the register n  199 were assessed for their
suitability to take part in the study whether they met the
entry criteria could give consent and were willing to take
part in the study could cooperate and tolerate having an
MRI scan and exhibited the absence of medical contraindications for MRI An additional four subjects were recruited
from a specialist dementia clinic Twenty six age matched
controls were recruited from among spouses and friends of
dementia subjects The local ethics committee approved
the research and all subjects as well as the nearest relative for patients gave informed consent after the nature of
the procedures had been fully explained 
Assessments and diagnosis All dementia subjects
were assessed as previously described 6 Cognitive function
was measured using the Cambridge Cognitive Examination CAMCOG 14 which incorporates the Mini Mental
State Examination MMSE 15 within 3 months of the MRI
scan Depressive symptoms were also rated using the
Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale MADRS 16
Standardized clinical diagnostic criteria were used to
characterize the type of dementia Diagnosis of AD VaD 
and DLB were made in accordance with National Institute
of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke

 Version 7 5 5 Mayo Foundation Rochester MN The
data were first reformatted into coronal slices perpendicular to the long axis of the left hippocampus slice thickness  1 mm cubic voxels of 1 mm correcting for any
malalignment when necessary 
Six regions of interest ROI were measured two indices
of global atrophy whole brain and ventricular volumes 
two indices of lobar atrophy frontal and temporal lobe
volumes and two indices of medial temporal atrophy hippocampal and amygdala volumes The right and left sides
of bilateral ROIs were measured on each slice in accordance with the anatomic boundaries described below in
 CSF spaces were excluded from all parenchymal
measurements To control for variation in head size volume for each ROI were normalized to the midsagittal intracranial area Final volumes were expressed as a

tween all subjects Total ventricular volumes were
nonspecifically increased in all subjects with dementia Atrophy was not associated with presence of
APOE 4 
The strengths of this study included the recruitment of community based elderly subjects with latelife dementia with comparable age sex education 
and duration of illness Volumetric differences between groups were therefore unlikely to be related to
differences in age or gender A potential criticism of
this study would be the reliance on clinical rather
than pathologic diagnoses However as previously
 clinical diagnoses were made after detailed assessments and in accordance with standardized criteria 
A major finding of this study was that subjects
with DLB had significantly larger whole temporal
lobes hippocampi and amygdalae than those with
AD This is consistent with and further extends our
previous observation using visual rating of medial
temporal lobe atrophy in the same sample 6 A similar
pattern of differential hippocampal atrophy in AD
and DLB has been reported 4 although the volume
loss in dementia subjects was less extensive in addition there was no difference in amygdala volume 
These discrepancies need to be explored further but
may reflect variations in methodology and sample
selection as our subjects were an average of 4 to 5
years older had had dementia for a longer period 
and had lower MMSE scores 
Importantly the differential pattern of temporal
lobe atrophy in DLB and AD during life is consistent
with autopsy studies 25 The convergence of findings
suggest that in the differentiation of DLB from AD 
the preservation of temporal lobe structures especially the hippocampus is supportive of a clinical
diagnosis of DLB Pathologically this may be explained by the relative absence of AD type pathology
in DLB especially neurofibrillary tangles 
All three dementia groups had more extensive
temporal lobe and hippocampal atrophy when compared with age matched controls In relation to AD 
this is highly consistent with well established 30 and may relate to the extent of tangle pathology 31 32 Previous studies have also reported
increased atrophy of temporal lobe structures in both
subjects with Lewy body 34 and 
when compared with normal controls The pathologic
basis of these findings is less clear Further neuropathologic studies are necessary in order to clarify
the relationship if any between concurrent AD type
pathology and temporal lobe atrophy on MRI in subjects with DLB and VaD It would be important to
determine whether MTA in life is a marker of AD type
pathology not only in AD but also in other disorders
where comorbid processes may be interacting 
Measures of global atrophy demonstrated significant enlargement of ventricles in dementia subjects
compared with control subjects Patients with DLB 
however had relatively well preserved whole brain
parenchyma volume Autopsy studies indicating NEUROLOGY 54
March 2 of 2 2000
ative preservation of synapse and neuronal counts in subjects with may explain this
relative conservation of overall brain volume 
Frontal lobe volumes were similar in all three dementia groups In relation to DLB and AD this replicates the finding of autopsy 37 and our
MRI pilot using a different cohort of subjects 
As such the results did not confirm previous reports
of an association between frontal lobe atrophy and
Lewy body 38 although once again comparisons between studies are complicated by differences in methodology patient selection and the
relative small number of subjects 
There were no significant differences in frontal
lobe volumes between control and dementia subjects 
This may reflect the limitations of our measurement 
which was restricted to the anterior third of the frontal lobe Alternatively it could indicate that changes
in frontal lobe volume are a relatively normal feature
of successful aging or that in subjects with dementia
atrophy may only emerge at a late stage in the progression of the illness This could account for the
discrepancies between ante mortem and post mortem studies noted above 
Overall we observed no MRI volumetric differences between DLB and VaD This suggests other
structural changes in particular cerebral infarcts 
possibly in conjunction with white matter changes 39
are likely to be more useful in discriminating these
conditions Given that subjects with VaD performed
better on tests of cognitive function it raises the possibility that differences in neurochemical substrates may
underlie the cognitive impairment in DLB 
The role of APOE in the pathogenesis of dementias remains to be determined In particular studies
examining the relationship between the APOE 4 allele and neuroimaging changes have so far produced
contrasting findings 7 40 Our results accord with
those of Jack et al 9 as we found no association between volumetric indices and the presence of the
APOE 4 allele Further this finding was observed
in subjects with AD as well as those with DLB and
VaD Although still controversial this finding suggests atrophic processes are not directly linked to the
presence of APOE 4 allele 
There is a growing body of evidence from both in
vivo MRI and autopsy studies to suggest that the
consensus criteria for should be modified to
emphasize the relative preservation of temporal lobe
structures in DLB compared with AD
