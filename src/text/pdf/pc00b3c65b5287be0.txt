Mono glycosylated sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids play important roles in diverse biological
processes and are linked to a variety of pathologies such as Parkinson disease The precise identication of the carbohydrate head group of these lipids is complicated by their isobaric nature and by
substantial differences in concentration in different biological samples To overcome these obstacles we
developed a zwitterionic ZIC hydrophilic interaction chromatography HILIC electrospray ionization
tandem mass spectrometry method ZIC HILIC preferentially retains inositol followed by glucose and
galactose featuring lipids Comparison with unmodied silica gel HILIC stationary phase revealed different retention specicity To evaluate the precision of ZIC HILIC we quantied glucosyl GlcCer and
galactosylceramides GalCer in seven different regions of the mouse brain and discovered that GlcCer
and GalCer concentrations are inversely related The highest GalCer lowest GlcCer content was found
in the medulla oblongata and hippocampus whereas the highest GlcCer lowest GalCer content was
found in other regions With a neutral loss scan ZIC HILIC resolved glucosylceramide species featuring
non hydroxylated fatty acid hydroxylated fatty acid and trihydroxy sphingoid bases in mouse epidermis
samples This demonstrates that our ZIC HILIC based approach is a valuable tool for characterizing the
structural diversity of mono glucosylated lipids in biological material and for quantifying these important
lipids

glycosphingolipids and it also acts as a glucose donor in ChlGlc
biosynthesis 4 In brain tissue the glucose head group of GlcCer
is predominantly replaced by its epimer galactose giving rise
to galactosylceramide GalCer GlcCer and GalCer are integral to
neural function performing different roles in the brain GalCer is
a component of myelin and plays a critical role in myelin related
functions 5 whereas GlcCer is involved in axonal growth 6 7 On
the other hand PtdGlc a novel glycerol type glucosylated lipid is
a minor component of lipid rafts 8 Recently PtdGlc was found to
serve as an important guidance cue for spinal cord sensory axons
after it undergoes hydrolysis by phospholipases to lyso PtdGlc
9 However phosphatidylinositol PtdIns the isobaric isomer of
PtdGlc is abundantly present in brain 
In non neural tissues GlcCer exhibits structural complexity and each GlcCer species has distinctive functions as in
ceramide species 10 In skin acylated or hydroxylated GlcCer are
involved in epidermal cell differentiation 11 12 Consequently a
highly reproducible analytical method capable of isometric based

separation via the carbohydrate and ceramide moiety is highly
desired in order to gain a better understanding of the biological
functions of mono glycosylated lipids 
Liquid chromatography LC electrospray ionization tandem
mass spectrometry ESIMS MS is a powerful tool for lipidomic
analyses Further improvement is achieved via a two dimensional
LC setup featuring a combination of two different chromatographic
methods This setup enhances identication of minor lipid species
in qualitative analysis as well as reproducibility in quantitative
analysis 13 14 Reversed phase chromatography is used widely to
separate lipid samples primarily based on the length and degree
of saturation of their respective alkyl chains Unfortunately subtle
alterations of the head group such as substituting glucose for galactose cannot be resolved 15 By contrast hydrophilic interaction
chromatography HILIC a type of normal phase chromatography is able to resolve lipids based on their head groups 1618 
HILIC separation is based on the analyte partitioning between
acetonitrile rich mobile phase and a water rich layer absorbed on
the hydrophilic stationary phase More hydrophilic analytes are
retained on the column as their partitioning equilibrium shifts more
toward the water layer on the stationary phase 19 20 
While the HILIC method was initially developed for the separation of amino acids the successful separation of GlcCer from
GalCer has also been reported using a fused core silica and amino
column 21 22 More recently a HILIC based method using ultraperformance LC and supercritical uid chromatography has been
demonstrated to discriminate sufciently between GlcCer and GalCer in brain tissue samples 23 24 While these approaches have
been used to quantify both GlcCer and GalCer they suffer from substantial variability among different samples 2124 Consequently 
an alternative method with improved resolution of complex GlcCer
would be highly desirable 
A zwitterionic ZIC stationary phase consists of oppositely
charged groups and is a phase that can be used to separate phospholipid classes based on electrostatic interactions 25 In general 
a ZIC stationary phase retains a thick hydration layer that generates strong hydrophilic interactions with analytes 20 This feature
facilitates the separation of congurational isomers and the discrimination of hydroxylated molecules such as glycopeptides and
carbohydrates 2629 
In the present study we evaluated the efcacy of ZIC HILIC
stationary phases for isometric separation of a variety of glucosylated lipid classes Following method optimization we rst
compared the chromatographic behaviors of two classes of glycolipids on a ZIC HILIC with an unmodied silica gel HILIC stationary
phase Next we evaluated the utility and reproducibility of our
method for the quantitative analysis of GlcCer in brain tissue and
demonstrated that it is highly suitable for analyzing other glycolipids such as PtdGlc and PtdIns Additionally the successful
discrimination of complex epidermal GlcCer mixtures based on
their ceramide moieties via a two column setup conrmed the suitability of our ZIC HILIC method for characterizing the carbohydrate
and ceramide moieties of GlcCer simultaneously

Results and discussion
3 1 Optimization and reproducibility
HILIC separation of lipids is usually achieved with mobile phases
composed of 9597 acetonitrile in water or a volatile solvent
1619 21 22 25 For example bacterial phospholipids are separated on ZIC HILIC with a mobile phase containing 5 water 25 
In the present study we selected an acetonitrile water mixture
 96 4 v v containing 5 mM ammonium formate which sufciently
retained GlcCer and PtdGlc samples on the column In order to
ensure reproducible results the column was regenerated with acetonitrile water 80 20 v v prior to each analysis 
The reproducibility of elution times and peak areas was conrmed by analyzing a synthetic mixture of PtdGlc 18 0 18 0 and
PtdIns 18 0 18 0 Over seven runs the results were highly reproducible Fig with a retention time coefcients of variation CV 
for PtdGlc and PtdIns of 0 9 The peak area CVs of PtdGlc and
PtdIns were 6 7 and 7 4 respectively This represents a signicant improvement compared with our previously reported method
based on normal phase chromatography with a chloroform based
solvent system 33 demonstrating the suitability of ZIC HILIC to
reliably quantify PtdGlc

3 2 ZIC HILIC versus unmodied silica gel HILIC
Next we compared the chromatographic behaviors of standard
reference materials such as HexCers phosphatidyl hexosides and
PtdIns Fig 1 on an unmodied silica gel HILIC with ZIC HILIC 
The HexCer species with 1 24 1 1 16 0 and 1 12 0
were monitored by the following MRM pairs 810 6 264 4 
700 6 264 4 and 644 6 264 4 respectively using product ions of
the dehydration sphingolipid base at m z 264 4 36 37 On ZICHILIC Fig 1A glucose featuring HexCer species were eluted
after their corresponding galactose analogs mutually separating GlcCer and GalCer species Phosphatidyl hexosides exhibited
the same carbohydrate dependent elution pattern Fig 1B Fig 
 as indicated by their respective retention factors for PtdGlc
sn 1 2 18 0 20 0 k 3 38 and PtdGal 18 0 20 0 k 3 36 The
preferential retention of glucosylated lipids compared with their
galactosylated analogs was also observed on a sulfobetaine stationary phase Fig By contrast on an unmodied silica gel
HILIC stationary phase galactosylated glycolipids were preferentially retained as indicated by the respective retention factors for
PtdGlc k 2 90 compared with PtdGal k 3 00 Taken together 
the preferential retention of glucosylated compared with galactosylated glycolipids appears to be due to the hydrophilic interactions
that occur with increased thickness of the hydration layer of the
stationary phase 38 
The effect of the fatty acid chain pattern on the retention times
was strikingly similar in all columns used In general increasing the
fatty acyl chain length weakened analyte retention and resulted
in reduced retention times For example both GlcCer and GalCer
featuring a 1 12 0 ceramide moiety were eluted later than
their 1 24 1 ceramide featuring analogs By contrast alteration of the stereoconguration of the glycerol moiety gave almost
identical retention factors Fig 1B Acetylated PtdGlc k 3 16 i e 
6 O acetylation was weakly retained on the column and therefore
eluted earlier than that of non acetylated PtdGlc Inositides such
as PtdIns k 3 61 and lyso PtdIns k 4 51 were eluted later than
their respective glucoside and galactoside analogs in all employed
systems Together these results correspond well to our previously
reported observations using normal phase chromatography 33 
3 3 Analysis of hexosylceramides in brain tissue
To demonstrate the applicability of our ZIC HILIC method over
a broad range of biologically relevant concentrations the monohexosylceramide content present in total lipid extracts from whole
mouse brain tissue at postnatal day 5 and adult 10 weekold mice was quantied In contrast to the large amount of GalCer
present in adult mouse brain mouse brain tissue contains only
a small amount 39 The integrity of our brain samples was conrmed with a boric acid impregnated TLC plate and co migration
with standards As expected low amounts of HexCers were found
in mouse brain tissue and GalCer was predominantly found
in adult mouse brain Fig 2A The MRM proles Fig 2B GlcCer
species indicated by asterisks demonstrated that regardless of the
large amount of GalCer GlcCer was still well resolved 
The major fatty acid present in GlcCer from mouse brain
was stearic acid Fig 2B light green 1 18 0 whereas the
predominant fatty acid in GalCer from adult mouse brain was a
nervonic acid residue 1 24 1 In adult mouse brain the preference for long chain fatty acids of GalCer is preserved GalCer
featuring  hydroxylated OHFA long chain fatty acids exhibited a longer retention time compared to their non hydroxylated
 non OHFA analogs OHFAs are characteristically present in

and striped bars in B indicate GalCer with OHFA The content and variability for each compound are shown in Table 
GalCer species which is the predominant constituent in adult
mouse brain 
To evaluate the reproducibility of our HILIC methods the HexCer species extracted from 9 month old mouse brains Table 1 
were repeatedly analyzed An unnatural GlcCer 1 12 0 was
added to validate the feasibility of the extraction method Its recovery was also appropriately 93 8  13 4 n 4 Across four samples
the relative standard deviations RSD on ZIC HILIC were reproducible with a range of 6 3 to 35 6 The unmodied silica gel
HILIC RSDs were within 6 5 to 42 3 In both cases the determined concentration of low abundant constituents such as GlcCer
 1 16 0 GlcCer 1 20 0 and GlcCer 1 22 0 was
comparable although their respective RSDs were relatively high 
Taken together these results demonstrate that our method is sufciently robust for the quantication of GlcCer in biological samples 
such as brain tissue 
3 4 Distribution of HexCer in brain
Imaging mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for determining
the spatial distribution of lipids in the brain 40 Because of the isobaric nature of HexCer this technique is incapable of discriminating
between different carbohydrate moieties thus precluding the analysis of minor GlcCer species 41 Using our ZIC HILIC method 
the concentrations of 14 species of HexCer were determined
in seven different regions of adult mouse brain olfactory bulb 
hypothalamus cerebellum medulla oblongata hippocampus cortex and other regions Fig 3 and Table In each region the
total amount of GalCer exceeded GlcCer The medulla oblongata
and hippocampus were especially rich in GalCer but poor in GlcCer In contrast olfactory bulb hypothalamus cortex and other
regions exhibited the highest GlcCer content but the lowest GalCer content Thus the distribution of GlcCer compared to GalCer
in brain regions exhibited an inverse relationship rationalizing the
variation of GalCer excess between 50 and 350 fold compared to
GlcCer 
In terms of fatty acid modication of the ceramide moiety sizeable amounts of palmitic acid 16 0 were detected in the GlcCer
fraction isolated from the olfactory bulb Fig 3 red Stearic acid
 18 0 was the main fatty acid found in the four GlcCer rich regions
 Fig 3 light green By contrast the highest content of stearic
acid 18 0 featuring GalCer was in the medulla oblongata and
hippocampus coinciding with the lowest content of stearic acid
 18 0 featuring modied GlcCer A similar inverse pattern was
observed for arachidic acid 20 0 behenic acid 22 0 and lignoceric acid 24 0 despite their relatively low content in GlcCer
and GalCer Nervonic acid 24 1 is the major fatty acid modication found in GalCer which is specically enriched in the medulla
oblongata and hippocampus Fig 3 blue In the case of GlcCer nervonic acid featuring species were distributed evenly  Hydroxy
fatty acids were found only in the GalCer fraction with the highest
content in the olfactory bulb

Fig 4 HILIC ESIMS MS of lipid mixtures extracted from mouse epidermis A Extracted ion chromatograms generated by a neutral loss scan Detected peaks were divided
into three classes based on retention times ZIC HILIC and unmodied silica gel column and B Mass spectra eluted around each group Class was
separated into two peaks on ZIC HILIC GlcCer species with HFA GlcCer species with a trihydroxy sphingoid base 
This heterogeneous distribution of HexCer species likely is
related to their region specic function For example a substantial part of white matter is composed of myelin sheath tissue that
is rich in nervonic acid featuring GalCer 42 43 Consequently the
high content of GalCer with nervonic acid species in the medulla
oblongata and hippocampus correlate well with the high content
of white matter in these regions of the brain Therefore the distinct
HexCer composition of each analyzed brain region and the considerable uctuation of their respective regional content highlights the
importance of quantifying local alterations in HexCer composition
at the onset and during the progression of neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson disease If slight differences in GlcCer levels
need to be measured further during disease progression samples should also be analyzed with the HILIC ESIMS MS method
combined with an ion mobility system which we are currently
developing Taken together our ZIC HILIC method is exceptionally suitable for analyzing signicant differences in minor GlcCer
content across different brain regions 
3 5 Qualitative analysis of hexosylceramide in skin
In general the epidermis is composed of a complex mixture of
hexosylceramides with a considerable diversity in their ceramide
moiety This includes the presence of an additional hydroxyl group
at the  or  position of the fatty acid residue or at the long
chain base sphingoid base moieties such as 4 hydroxysphinganine
or 6 hydroxysphingosine 11 12 By contrast the carbohydrate
moiety lacks diversity as it is limited primarily to glucose 44 
Consequently characterization of the HexCer mixture in mouse
epidermis samples is ideal for demonstrating the versatility of our
method to discriminate compounds based on differences in their
ceramide moiety To assess the complexity of the ceramide moieties we detected and characterized HexCers based on LC retention
times and m z values by neutral loss scan The neutral loss of 180 Da
has been previously associated with the loss of a hexosyl residue
by cleavage of its glycosidic linkage 34 
Three distinct classes and of HexCers were clearly
separated by our ZIC HILIC method based on differences in their
ceramide moiety Fig 4A Class seemed to lack any additional
hydroxylation but did possess a variety of fatty acid residues
between 0 to 1 Fig 4B ZIC HILIC and Table 2 Class 
and were exclusively composed of HexCer with an additional
hydroxyl group The 2 min shift in the retention time of class 
compared with class and the observed m z values were indicative of an additional hydroxyl group at either the  or  position
of the fatty acid residue HFA OHFA or OHFA By contrast 
m z values of class corresponded to known sphingolipids with
a trihydroxy long chain base such as 4 hydroxy sphinganine and
6 hydroxy sphingosine 12 45 
For comparison we used an unmodied silica gel HILIC column
to analyze the epidermal HexCer mixture Fig 4A This method
resolved classes and which correspond to non hydroxylated
HexCer and class which corresponds to a mixture of fatty
acids and long chain base hydroxylated HexCer Interestingly the
ions present in class were predominantly 2 Da heavier than
the ions present in class indicating a higher degree of saturation in the long chain base moiety For example the m z value at
812 in and at 810 in corresponded to GlcCer 0 24 1 
and GlcCer 1 24 1 respectively Thus the method using
an unmodied silica gel column was capable of discriminating
between GlcCer species with sphingosine and those with sphinganine However the full characterization of unidentied
signals such as m z 798 7 and m z 810 7 will require additional
experiments Fig 4A Table 2 Additionally minor components
such as GlcCer containing OHFA and trihydroxy sphingoid bases
should be characterized Currently we are also developing a twodimensional HILIC MS method combined with a reversed phase
mode to efciently characterize minor GlcCer species These results

Conclusions
We established and validated the reproducibility of a novel
ZIC HILIC based HPLCMS MS method for the analysis of glycosphingolipids and glycophospholipids The preferred retention
of Ins  Glc  Gal allowed the outright identication of the carbohydrate moiety despite their isobaric nature Additionally GlcCer 
the minor component in brain samples was condently analyzed 
even in the presence of a 350 times excess of GalCer In skin samples our ZIC HILIC method demonstrated its potential to resolve
fatty acid and long chain base hydroxylation Comparison of our
new method with an unmodied silica gel HILIC column revealed
an inverted retention prole and separation characteristics with
respect to the lipid moiety Thus our approach with two HILIC
methods successfully quantied glucosylated lipids in brain and
skin tissues
