Abstract
With high resolution quantitative magnetic resonance imaging MRI techniques it is now possible to examine alterations in brain
anatomy in vivo and to identify regions affected in the earliest stages of Alzheimers disease AD In this study we compared MRI derived
entorhinal and hippocampal volume in healthy elderly controls patients who presented at the clinic with cognitive complaints but did not
meet criteria for dementia non demented and patients with very mild AD The two patient groups differed significantly from controls in
entorhinal volume but not from each other in contrast they differed from each other as well as from controls in hippocampal volume 
with the mild AD cases showing the greatest atrophy Follow up clinical evaluations available on 23 28 non demented patients indicated
that 12 23 had converted to AD within 1277 months from the baseline MRI examination Converters could be best differentiated from
non converters on the basis of entorhinal but not hippocampal volume These data suggest that although both the EC and hippocampal
formation degenerate before the onset of overt dementia EC volume is a better predictor of conversion  2001 Elsevier Science Inc All

Introduction
Quantitative high resolution magnetic resonance imaging MRI techniques provide a unique tool for examining
alterations in brain anatomy in vivo during healthy aging
and in age related degenerative diseases Such techniques
are especially useful in identifying the anatomical origins of
Alzheimers disease AD

The entorhinal cortex EC and the hippocampal formation HF are part of the mesial temporal lobe memory
system 42 50 the EC connects the neocortex with the HF
via the perforant path thereby providing the latter with
multimodal sensory information These brain regions have
received special attention in investigations on the pathophysiology of AD since memory dysfunction is one of its
earliest hallmarks 
Post mortem pathological studies have implicated the EC
and the transentorhinal region as early sites of involvement
in AD and in individuals with mild cognitive impairment
4  6 18 21 35 46 However the EC has received less attention in in vivo investigations partly due to the fact that
MRI derived quantitative protocols for this structure were
only recently developed 2 22

Atrophy of the HF a region important for the acquisition
of certain types of new information i e declarative knowledge has been well documented in AD using quantitative
volumetric MRI analyses 7 1214 23 24 29 32 38 40 48 
49 More recently atrophy of the EC was demonstrated in
AD with MRI based quantitation of its volume 27 49 Yet 
while in vivo anatomical investigations using structural MRI
are rapidly proliferating relatively few volumetric studies
have focused strictly on patients in the earliest stages of AD
or on those with mild cognitive impairment see for example 31 49 
Two studies that measured the entire parahippocampal
gyrus failed to detect significant atrophy in this structure in
patients with a clinical diagnosis of very mild AD 14 24 
In these mild cases however there was significant hippocampal atrophy These results were initially somewhat
surprising given the early pathological involvement of the
entorhinal and transentorhinal cortices in the disease process In the two studies cited above parahippocampal gyrus
volume included both white and gray matter and in the case
of the report from our laboratory 14 measurements continued beyond the anatomical boundaries of the entorhinal
and perirhinal cortices As a result any changes in the EC
itself may have been masked It was therefore important to
use newly developed protocols for the quantitation of the
EC in order to re examine its involvement in patients with
very mild or incipient AD 
In addition to patients with very mild AD individuals at
high risk for AD are now being studied in order to identify
anatomical changes that precede a clinical diagnosis and to
develop sensitive in vivo markers that might be predictive of
conversion to AD One such group consists of those patients
who have cognitive complaints cognitive impairment or
both but who do not meet diagnostic criteria for dementia
after a thorough evaluation Such groups are of special
interest since they provide information on the transitional
state between normal aging and AD although definitions
and designations of this subgroup have varied 8 15 25 36 
37 A number of investigations have suggested that when
followed longitudinally these individuals are at increased
risk for developing AD 1 3 9 15 31 36 43 Furthermore 
there is increased risk for incident dementia among elderly
people with subjective or informant corroborated memory
complaints even if their baseline cognitive assessment is
normal 17 26 39 44 45 
Of the few MRI studies that have examined the volumes
of mesial temporal lobe structures in elderly patients with
mild cognitive impairment or age associated memory impairment some have found hippocampal atrophy 7 10 25 
49 while others have not 32 41 Two recent investigations that assessed MRI based entorhinal volume in such
patients found significant EC atrophy compared to controls
The present research was undertaken to compare the
extent of MRI derived hippocampal and entorhinal atrophy
in very mild and incipient AD in an attempt to determine the
earliest sites of pathological involvement in the disease
process and to develop in vivo anatomical markers 
Materials and methods
2 1 Subjects
Data reported here were obtained from the following
three groups of participants 1 34 healthy elderly normal
control subjects NC 2 28 patients who were evaluated for
cognitive complaints but who did not meet clinical criteria
for dementia they are referred to here as non demented
patients or ND and 3 16 patients with very mild probable
AD The major difference between the ND patients and the
elderly controls is that the patients were recruited from a
clinic where they were being evaluated for possible dementia whereas the elderly controls were recruited from the
general population and had to meet the criteria described
below 
2 2 Clinical work up
All evaluations were carried out at the Rush Alzheimers
Disease Center RADC Chicago IL as previously described 14 48 Briefly the evaluation incorporated the
Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimers Disease
 CERAD 34 procedures and included a medical history 
neurological examination neuropsychological testing informant interview and blood tests 
The clinical diagnosis of probable AD followed
NINCDS ADRDA guidelines 33 it required a history of
cognitive decline and neuropsychological test evidence of
impairment in at least two cognitive domains one of which
had to be memory In the present study we only included
patients with a diagnosis of probable AD whose Mini Mental State Examination MMSE 17 score was 26 i e 
those with very mild AD 
Patients in the non demented group presented at the
clinic with cognitive complaints received the same standard
evaluation as the AD patients but did not meet clinical
criteria for dementia Exclusion criteria for both AD and ND
patients were evidence of other neurologic psychiatric or
systemic conditions that could cause cognitive impairment
 e g stroke alcoholism major depression Neuropsychological test results indicated that the ND group included 13
members with isolated memory impairment two members
with impairment of attention one with language deficits and
12 individuals without demonstrable cognitive deficits on
clinical testing It should be noted that no individual patient
in this group had a deficit in more than one domain Because
elderly individuals with complaints of memory are at high
risk of developing AD even if they do not show significant
deficits on formal testing we did not exclude those ND
patients without demonstrable cognitive deficits for the purpose of this study 
B C Dickerson et al Neurobiology of Aging 22 2001 747754
Control subjects were recruited from friends and family
members of patients and the RADC staff as well as from
hospital volunteers Selection as an elderly control subject
required a normal neurological examination an MMSE
score 28 and CERAD delayed list recall 6 Exclusion
criteria for the controls were the same as those used for the
patient groups Informed consent was obtained from all
subjects according to the rules of the Human Investigation
Committee of Rush Medical College 
2 3 Acquisition and quantitation of MRI data
All MR images were acquired on a 1 5 Tesla General
Electric Signa scanner Gapless 5 mm coronal slices were
taken perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampal
formation with the following parameters matrix  256 
256 field of view  16 cm eight acquisitions TR  400 
TE  1316 In addition gapless 5 mm sagittal slices were
taken spanning the entire brain with the following parameters matrix  256  128 field of view  24 cm one
acquisition TR  200 TE  12 1
Manual segmentation with a PC based image analysis
program Amersham Image Analysis System with software
designed by Loates Associates was used to compute volumes of regions of interest To correct for individual differences in brain size entorhinal and hippocampal volumes
were normalized by dividing with intracranial volume derived from sagittal slices To compute intracranial volume 
the inner table of the cranium was traced in consecutive
sagittal sections spanning the entire brain At the level of the
foramen magnum a straight line was drawn from the inner
surface of the clivus to the most anterior extension of the
occipital bone 
EC volume was quantified with the use of a new protocol
developed and validated in our laboratory technical details
of which are presented in Goncharova et al 19 accompanying manuscript The advantage of this protocol is that EC
volume is measured from the same oblique coronal sections
most commonly used for hippocampal volumetry to avoid
overestimation of one of these two adjacent structures at the
expense of the other 
Briefly both entorhinal and hippocampal volumes were
computed separately for the right and left hemispheres from
coronal slices taken perpendicular to the long axis of the
HF For the EC tracing began with the first section in which
the gyrus ambiens amygdala and the white matter of the
parahippocampal gyrus first appeared visible The superomedial border in rostral sections was the sulcus semiannularis and in caudal sections the subiculum The shoulder of
the collateral sulcus was used as the lateral border The
latter is somewhat of a conservative criterion that allowed
consistency in tracings and avoided the use of different
lateral borders depending on individual differences in the
depth of the collateral sulcus see for example ref 22 In
the majority of cases tracings were carried out on 4 5
sections Validation procedures as well as inter and intra 
Fig 1 A single coronal slice illustrating an example of the tracings used to
measure the volumes of the entorhinal cortex right and hippocampal
formation left 
rater reliability scores for EC measurements are described in
Goncharova et al 19 accompanying paper 
The protocol and validation procedures used for quantifying hippocampal volume were published previously 14 
48 Tracings of the HF started with the first section where
the dentate gyrus could be clearly identified and included
the fimbria dentate gyrus the hippocampus proper and the
subiculum All sections in which the hippocampus could be
clearly seen without partial volume averaging were included
 usually 6 7 slices 
Fig 1 shows sample tracings of both the EC and HF from
a single MR image 
2 4 Statistical analyses
Group differences were evaluated with the use of either
one way or two way repeated measures analyses of variance ANOVA followed by post hoc comparisons with the
studentized range test Logistic regression analyses were
performed to determine how well hippocampal and entorhinal volume could predict group membership 
Results
As indicated above all patients in the ND group sought
formal evaluations due to complaints of cognitive decline 
Because there were no significant differences in EC or HF
volumes based on the presence or absence of cognitive
deficits on formal testing data not shown the group of ND
patients was considered as a whole in all subsequent analyses 
Demographic and MMSE data are presented in Table 1 
Separate one way ANOVAs showed that the three groups
did not differ in age or level of education There was 
however a significant group effect for MMSE scores

regions of interest were assessed with separate two way
repeated measures ANOVAs with group and hemisphere as
the two factors The analysis on entorhinal volume showed
significant group F 2 75  15 73 p  0 001 and hemisphere F 1 75  13 11 p  0 001 effects but no significant interaction between them The hemisphere effect can
be accounted for by a larger right EC in all three groups 
Pairwise comparisons indicated that both the ND patients
and those with mild AD differed significantly from controls
in total EC volume p  0 05 but not from each other 
The ANOVA on hippocampal volume also showed significant group F 2 75  16 65 p  0 001 and hemisphere
F 1 75  14 02 p  0 001 effects without a significant
interaction between them However in this case pairwise
comparisons demonstrated that the two patient groups dif 
fered in total hippocampal volume from controls as well as
from each other p  0 05 with the very mild AD group
showing the greatest atrophy 
Logistic regression analyses were then performed to determine how well hippocampal and entorhinal volume could
predict group membership In these analyses total EC and
HF volumes were used as predictors to determine the extent
to which each region of interest contributed separately to
describing group differences with models used for two
groups at a time Scatter plots showing the logistic regression lines for two groups at a time are displayed in Fig 4 
The results of the logistic regressions were consistent
with the ANOVA findings EC volume was better than
hippocampal volume at predicting membership in the ND
group compared to controls even with hippocampal volume

in the model In this case hippocampal volume did not add
significantly to predictions based on EC volume the latter
alone correctly classified 69 of all subjects in the two
groups  12 7 p  0 001 
In contrast when comparing patients with very mild AD
to ND cases the prediction based on hippocampal volume
alone suggested improvement over the prediction based on
EC volume alone  3 76 p  0 052 Entorhinal
volume did not contribute any additional ability to classify
patients with AD Again the volume of each area of interest
predicted group membership significantly when examined
alone but more subjects could be classified accurately using
hippocampal volume 75  8 64 p  0 003 
The comparison of patients with very mild AD and
control subjects indicated that both entorhinal and hippocampal volume contributed significantly to the model 
The model with both predictors classified 86 of the cases
correctly  29 8 p  0 001 
The results of the logistic regression analyses did not
change when adjusted for age or sex Taken together they
indicate that the primary difference between the controls
and ND patients is in entorhinal volume while hippocampal
atrophy plays a more important role in differentiating AD
patients from the ND cases 
Follow up clinical evaluations available on 23 of the 28
ND participants included in this study indicated that 12 of
the 23 had converted since the initial clinical and MRI
evaluation and received a clinical diagnosis of probable AD 
The follow up period ranged from 12 to 77 months mean 
39 and was equivalent for converters and non converters
t 22  0 63 p  0 05 See Table 2  Entorhinal and
hippocampal volumes derived from the baseline MRI
showed that converters differed significantly from non converters in total right  left entorhinal volume t 22 
2 94 p  0 008 but not hippocampal volume see Fig 5 
Further in logistic regressions using total hippocampal and
entorhinal volume as predictors only EC volume was a
significant predictor of the likelihood of conversion odds
ratio  0 993 per normalized unit volume p  0 046

Fig 5 Box plot comparing MRI derived entorhinal left hand side and
hippocampal right hand side volume in non demented participants who
converted to a diagnosis of Alzheimers disease in contrast to those who
did not The central box shows the data between the upper and lower
quartiles with the median represented by the line The height of the line is
the interquartile range IQR the whiskers extend from the upper and
lower quartiles to a distance of 1 5 IQR away or to the most extreme data
point within that range whichever is closer 
Thus for every 10 unit decrease in EC volume the chances
of converting to AD increased by 7 Results were not
changed by adjustment for age or follow up interval When
entorhinal volume alone was used as a predictor 83 3 of
converters and 72 7 of non converters were correctly classified 
It is interesting to note that among the 12 ND patients
who converted 9 had a memory impairment 2 had attentional deficits and one did not show any demonstrable cognitive deficits on clinical testing Of the 11 non demented
participants who did not convert to AD four had a memory
impairment and seven had no demonstrable cognitive impairment on clinical testing 
Discussion
A major strength of our study is the inclusion of extremely mild cases of AD and a comparison of the anatomical changes detected in vivo in these mild cases with those
observed in patients who do not meet diagnostic criteria but
are at risk for AD 
Individuals at risk for AD are of interest since they
provide valuable information on the transitional state between normal aging and AD Different investigators have
used different definitions to characterize this population 
although recently criteria for mild cognitive impairment
have been more stringently formulated 36 37 These criteria include objective memory impairment Thus the difference between the ND group in the present study and mild
cognitive impairment as defined by Petersen and colleagues
36 37 is that we included some individuals who presented
at the clinic with subjective cognitive complaints but did
not show objective deficits Our reason for including them
was that they have been shown to be at high risk for AD as
well 17 Although we recognize the limitations of our
approach it is of interest to note that the rate of conversion
observed in the ND group in this study is very similar to the
rate reported by Petersen 36 for those diagnosed with mild
cognitive impairment 
The results described above showed that both patient
groups mild AD and ND differed from controls in entorhinal volume but not from each other In contrast the two
patient groups differed from controls in hippocampal volume as well as from each other with the AD cases showing
the greatest atrophy Taken together these findings suggest
that degeneration of the EC and HF occurs before the onset
of obvious dementia and that HF atrophy is associated with
the progression from mild subjective or objective cognitive
impairment to AD Although the ND group showed significant atrophy in both structures logistic regression models
demonstrated that entorhinal volume was better than hippocampal volume in differentiating these patients from controls suggesting that the EC becomes pathologically involved before the HF On the other hand the extent of
hippocampal atrophy was better at differentiating patients
with very mild AD from ND cases atrophy of both structures played an equivalent role in differentiating patients
with very mild AD from controls 
The lack of a significant difference between the two
patient groups in entorhinal volume and the fact that the ND
cases could best be differentiated from controls by EC
volume further suggest that MRI based entorhinal atrophy
may provide an in vivo marker of incipient AD This suggestion is strongly supported by the fact that converters to
AD among the ND participants could be best differentiated
from non converters on the basis of entorhinal volume 
Our findings on hippocampal atrophy in patients with
very mild AD are in general agreement with most of the
published literature to date In numerous studies on MRbased volumetric estimates of mesial temporal lobe structures in AD HF atrophy has been shown to be one of the
most robust and consistently documented findings 11 12 
14 2325 28 30 32 40 48 49 However only a few groups
have focused their investigations on patients with very mild
AD 
The literature is less clear cut with respect to alterations
in hippocampal volume in patients with isolated memory
complaints or mild cognitive impairment compared to controls Our finding of hippocampal atrophy in the ND group
is consistent with results reported by two other laboratories
7 25 49 However two studies published by another group
failed to find significant hippocampal atrophy in such patients 32 41 
A likely reason for this inconsistency is selection criteria 
Most groups reporting on MR volumetric studies of elderly
patients with mild cognitive impairment or age associated
memory impairment have selected their subjects by neuro 
B C Dickerson et al Neurobiology of Aging 22 2001 747754
psychological test scores some have focused on clinic populations while others have studied community derived samples 
The investigators reporting an absence of significant hippocampal atrophy obtained their sample from a communitybased population which was later shown to have only a 10 
incidence of dementia in 3 5 years of follow up 20 Therefore it is likely that their group contained a greater number of
subjects who were not in the incipient phases of AD at the time
MRI scans were acquired 
Our volumetric results on EC atrophy in AD are in
agreement with those reported by other laboratories 27 31 
49 They are also in agreement with two very recent papers
reporting that individuals with mild memory impairment
show significant atrophy of the EC compared to controls
31 49 However Killiany et al 31 found that among the
participants with mild memory impairment what discriminated converters from non converters was the volumes of
the superior temporal sulcus and anterior cingulate but not
the EC One possible factor contributing to the difference
between our findings on converters and theirs may be the
way in which EC volume was derived The estimate of EC
volume in the Killiany et al 31 paper was based on
tracings from three 1 5 mm coronal sections while ours was
based on a much larger portion of the structure 
In summary the in vivo anatomical results presented here
are in agreement with post mortem pathological studies and
underscore the early involvement of the entorhinal cortex in
AD The results further suggest that the progression to a
diagnosis of AD requires significant atrophy of the HF in
addition to the EC Taken together our findings demonstrate the potential of sensitive neuroimaging techniques for
the development of early anatomical markers of AD Such
predictive biological markers could be of great help for the
development and monitoring of early interventions designed
to retard disease progression

Notes
We now use a new protocol that acquires 1 6 mm
coronal images of the entire head with an SPGR pulse
sequence For purposes of consistency and to have
large enough group sizes the present study was restricted to those patients and controls scanned with our
old protocol
