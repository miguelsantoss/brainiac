Article abstract Magnetic resonance imaging based volumetric measurements of medial temporal lobe MTL 
structures can discriminate between normal elderly control subjects and patients with Alzheimers disease AD of
moderate to advanced severity In terms of clinical utility however a more important issue concerns the ability of the
technique to differentiate between normal elderly control subjects and AD patients with the very mildest form of the
disease We performed MRI based volumetric measurements of the hippocampus parahippocampal gyrus and amygdala
in 126 cognitively normal elderly control subjects and 94 patients with probable AD The diagnosis of AD was made
according to NINDS ADRDA criteria and disease severity was categorized by Clinical Dementia Rating CDR scores 
Patients with CDR 0 5 were classified as very mild CDR 1 as mild and CDR 2 as moderate disease severity Volumes of
each structure declined with increasing age in control subjects and did so in parallel for men and women The volume of
each measured MTL structure also declined with age in patients with AD The volume of each MTL structure was
significantly smaller in AD patients than control subjects p  0 001 Of the several MTL measures the total hippocampal volumetric measurements were best at discriminating control subjects from AD patients The mean hippocampal
volumes for AD patients relative to control subjects by severity of disease were as follows very mild AD CDR 0 5 75
SD below the control mean mild AD CDR 1 99 SD and moderate AD CDR 2 22 SD Age and gender adjusted 
normalized MRI based hippocampal volumetric measurements provide a sensitive marker of the MTL neuroanatomic
degeneration in AD early in the disease process

Alzheimers disease AD is the most common cause
of dementia in individuals older than 60 years of
age 1A well accepted biological concomitant of AD
is cerebral a t r p h y The
 rationale for quantitative
MRI of medial temporal lobe MTL atrophy in the
diagnosis of AD is 1 a memory impairment is usually the earliest and most severe clinical manifestation of AD 2 MTL limbic structures are central to
the integrity of declarative memory f n c t i o n 3 
MTL limbic structures are involved earliest and
most extensively in the pathology of AD 6 7and 4 
several principal MTL limbic structures are amenable to accurate volumetric quantitation by MRI the
hippocampal formation amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus PHG 8Based on initial studies 
MRI based volumetric measurements of the MTL
have been proposed as a clinically useful test for the
diagnosis of AD 13Some limitations of the published data include 1 anatomic boundary criteria
for the various MTL structures varied significantly
among the different studies 2 different structures
or combinations of MTL structures were evaluated in
the various studies 3 relatively small numbers of
subjects were included in individual studies and 4 
rigorous definitions of the severity of AD often were
not employed Most previous studies have primarily
included subjects with AD of moderate severity Consequently the differences between the AD patients
and control subjects with regard to MTL atrophy
have been dramatic The most important test of the
utility of the technique would be in patients with
very mild AD in whom the diagnostic decisionmaking process is difficult 
We report a large series of carefully evaluated and
longitudinally followed subjects with AD and a large
group of prospectively studied normal elderly control
subjects The AD patients were categorized on basis
of severity and include a large sample of individuals
with very mild AD As such we are able to evaluate
the utility of volumetric MRI in assisting in the clinical diagnosis of AD at its most mild stages The
goals of this study were 1 to characterize volumetric changes in the hippocampus amygdala and PHG
in normal aging and in AD and 2 to estimate the
ability of these measures to discriminate between

The posterior boundary of the PHG was defined in a
manner identical to that for the hippocampal formation 
The superior boundary of the PHG was defined as the
gray white matter interface between the subiculum and
the PHG white matter Medially the PHG was demarcated
by CSF in the uncal cistern Laterally and inferiorly its
boundary was the collateral sulcus The imaging slice immediately preceding that in which the hippocampal intralimbic gyrus first appeared when progressing from posterior to anterior was defined as the anterior boundary of the
PHG In some patients a clearly identifiable collateral sulcus was not present along the entire anteroposterior extent
of the PHG For this reason PHG measurements were not
possible in 16 control subjects and 14 AD patients 
The posterior superior medial and lateral boundaries
of the amygdala were defined by gray white matter borders or where appropriate CSF in the uncal cistern The
inferior border of the amygdala was either the uncal recess
of the temporal horn or the alveus covering the hippocampal head The anterior boundary of the amygdala is ill
defined in nature and we defined it operationally to be the
most anterior slice on which the head of the hippocampus
was present

were evaluated using stepwise regression including evaluation of nonlinearity and interactions Stepwise regression
was also used to determine if variability was associated
with age or gender 
Volumetric percentiles in controls specific for age and
gender were obtained using the algorithm described by
OBrien and D y k Age and gender specific volumetric
percentiles among AD patients were determined and converted to W scores normal deviates using the inverse of
the standard normal distribution a percentile value of 95
corresponding to a W score of 1 645 for example 38The W
score value is a covariate adjusted Z score relative to the
control group Comparison of W values among MTL anatomic structures for AD patients was performed using
ANOVA for repeated measures and paired t tests To identify the MTL limbic structures that best distinguish between AD and control subjects we performed a stepwise
discriminant analysis including normalized volumes age 
and gender as predictor variables 
Results Two hundred twenty subjects are included in
this control subjects and 94 AD patients table

education and gender distribution with approximately a

control subjects was 51 to 89 years and of AD patients was
50 to 89 years Forty four of the 126 control subjects were

Control subjects Normalized MTL volumes declined
with age in a linear fashion table 2 figure 2 The segment of the hippocampus that demonstrated the greatest
decline with age was the head No significant hemispheric
differences in volume loss with age were observed in any
MTL structure except the PHG where the age related volume loss was greater on the left than the right side p

age was 45 63 per year for the total hippocampus

The unnormalized MTL structure volumes of men were
generally larger than those of women while the normalized MTL volumes of women were generally larger than
those of men see table 2 and figure 2 That is these MTL
limbic structures occupied a larger percentage of TIV in
women than in men The decline in volume associated with
age did not differ significantly between men and women 
These associations were used to estimate age and genderspecific normal percentiles for TIV normalized MTL volumes table 3

MTL volumes with age was observed among AD patients

jects over the age range studied see table 2 and figure 2 
As with controls unnormalized volumes were generally
larger among men than women while larger normalized
volumes were observed among female AD patients Associations between MTL volume and age were linear and did
not differ between men and women The segment of the
hippocampus showing the greatest decline with age was
the head 
Age and gender specific percentiles for normalized volumes were computed for each of the AD patients and
these were converted to W scores corresponding to a normal distribution table 4 Thus values of W  0 indicate
that volume is less than the mean value expected for a
normal subject after adjustment for age and gender A
value of 96 corresponds to a value that is at the 2 5
percentile among normal controls 
We assessed the extent to which patients differed from
control subjects and for each anatomic structure W scores
were significantly  O among AD patients p  0 001 As
would be expected from table 2 the deficit in volumes
relative to controls was not associated with age or gender 
We also assessed whether the magnitude of the volumetric

Discrimination between controls and A D patients of
varying severity Using stepwise linear discriminant
analysis including age gender and TIV normalized volumes as independent variables to predict AD the only
variables that appeared in the final model were hippocampal volume hippocampal volume squared and age Although all these terms were significant a t the 0 02 level 
the prediction equation was dominated by the linear hippocampal volume term and the accuracy of the prediction
was identical to that obtained using hippocampal W scores
alone The sensitivity of hippocampal volumes to distinguish AD patients from control subjects was assessed by
computing the percentage of AD patients with W scores a t
selected percentiles among control subjects table 5 For
example at a fixed specificity of 80 the sensitivity of
hippocampal volumetric measurements in discriminating
control subjects from patients was 77 8 for CDR 0 5 
83 7 for CDR 1 and 86 7 for CDR 2 Discrimination
between control subjects and AD patients was roughly
equivalent among the three AD severity groups at the 50th
and 20th percentiles of normal Discrimination was
greater for CDRs 1 and 2 than CDR 0 5 patients at the
10th and fifth percentile of normal At the first percentile
of normal discrimination improved as the patients disease
severity CDR score increased 
Discussion In this study involving a large group
of well characterized AD patients and elderly control
subjects we have demonstrated that MR volumetric
measurements of the hippocampal formation are
useful in discriminating between very mild AD and
elderly control subjects The very mild AD subjects
 CDR 0 5 qualify for the diagnosis of probable AD by
clinical research criteria yet exhibit only the minimal
symptoms necessary for this diagnostic classification These patients present significant diagnostic
difficulties for the clinician and constitute an area
where a structural imaging test may be particularly
useful 
Control subjects All MTL limbic structures measured declined in volume with advancing age This is
consistent with observations of age related brain atrophy in other imaging and autopsy s t u d i e It

is not clear whether this volume loss is an inevitable
consequence of aging 14 41
Subjects enrolled as normal control subjects in this study were communitydwelling individuals with no evidence of cognitive
impairment Subjects with medical conditions e g 
heart disease diabetes hypertension were included
as normal control subjects It is possible that medical
conditions that increase in prevalence with advancing age and that may be associated with brain atrophy such as hypertension diabetes or atherosclerosis might account for some of the observed
correlation between age and volume loss in these

 this
 control population is typical of what a clinician faces in daily practice These data do not address the issue of optimal

The apolipoprotein E 4 allele is not
associated with psychiatric symptoms or
extrapyramidal signs in probable
Alzheimers disease

Article abstract The objective of our study was to examine the relationship between the presence of the apolipoprotein
E apo E 4 allele psychiatric symptoms and extrapyramidal signs EPS in probable Alzheimers disease AD The apo
E 4 allele modifies the risk and age a t onset of AD However it still needs t o be determined whether it is a marker for
specific clinical subgroups The frequency of clinical signs and symptoms was examined in 194 AD patients with the apo E
313 N 791 314 N 96 and 414 N 19 genotypes participating in a longitudinal study of dementia Each patient
was assessed with semistructured psychiatric and neurologic examinations Patients with the 414 genotype had an earlier
age a t onset of dementia p 0 03 However no individual psychiatric symptom or neurologic sign was associated with
the presence of the apo E 4 allele including major depression odds ratio OR 1 14 GI 0 50 to 2 45 p 0 781 psychosis
 e g delusions and hallucinations OR 0 66 GI 0 35 to 1 25 p 0 20 and EPS in neuroleptic free patients OR 0 82 
GI 0 45 to 1 49 p 0 52 after controlling by age at onset duration of the symptoms education and severity of
dementia The presence of the apo E 4 allele has limited utility in the characterization of neurologic and psychiatric
subgroups in probable AD patients The apo E 414 genotype appears to be related to age a t onset of AD consistent with
previous findings 
NEUROLOGY 1997 49 794
The apolipoprotein E apo E 4 allele has been
shown to modify risk and age at onset of Alzheimers
disease AD 1 Neuropathologic studies have found
more severe AD pathology in subjects carrying the
apo E 4 allele than in those without the allele This
includes more cortical neurofibrillary tangles and senile neuritic plaques SP 4and a more severe cholinergic deficit in the frontal Moreover neuroimaging studies have shown greater atrophy in
medial temporal structures in AD patients carrying
the apo E 4 allele 6
The development of psychiatric symptoms appears
t o be related t o more severe neuropathologic
change and to specific neurotransmitter imbalances notably acetylcholinelO and serotonin ll Consequently given that patients carrying the apo E 4
allele have more severe structural and neurochemical abnormalities psychiatric symptoms should be
