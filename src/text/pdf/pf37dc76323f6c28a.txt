ABSTRACT
Accurate and timely diagnosis of dementia is important
to guide management and provide appropriate
information and support to patients and families 
Currently with the exception of individuals with genetic
mutations postmortem examination of brain tissue
remains the only denitive means of establishing
diagnosis in most cases however structural
neuroimaging in combination with clinical assessment 
has value in improving diagnostic accuracy during life 
Beyond the exclusion of surgical pathology signal
change and cerebral atrophy visible on structural MRI
can be used to identify diagnostically relevant imaging
features which provide support for clinical diagnosis of
neurodegenerative dementias While no structural
imaging feature has perfect sensitivity and specicity for
a given diagnosis there are a number of imaging
characteristics which provide positive predictive value
and help to narrow the differential diagnosis While
neuroradiological expertise is invaluable in accurate scan
interpretation there is much that a non radiologist can
gain from a focused and structured approach to scan
analysis In this article we describe the characteristic MRI
ndings of the various dementias and provide a
structured algorithm with the aim of providing clinicians
with a practical guide to assessing scans

There are an estimated 36 million people with
dementia worldwide with this gure expected to
double every 20 years as the population ages 1 In
response to this challenge a number of countries have
committed to long term national dementia strategies 
which include improving timely diagnosis 25 For
many patients there are delays in diagnosis of dementia preventing them from accessing relevant care services information and treatment 68 Patients with
unrecognised cognitive impairment present in a range
of clinical settings often with health concerns unrelated to dementia in one study 42 of those aged
over 70 years admitted to an acute medical admissions unit had dementia with only half having been
diagnosed prior to admission 9
The most common causes of dementia are
Alzheimers disease AD vascular disease in several
forms dementia with Lewy bodies DLB and frontotemporal lobar degeneration FTLD but there are
many others 10 11 Accurate and early diagnosis has
considerable implications for the patient in terms of
prognosis and management and will be increasingly
important if and when disease modifying treatments
become available Currently postmortem examination of brain tissue remains the only denitive
means of establishing diagnosis in most cases 
Molecular biomarkers are now available to provide
support for a diagnosis of AD in life for example 
amyloid imaging with positron emission tomography PET and cerebrospinal uid CSF analysis
of amyloid  A142 and tau 12 13 however these
markers are mainly research tools and denitive
blood tests are still lacking Until these techniques
become widely available structural neuroimaging in
combination with clinical assessment offers the
greatest utility in improving diagnostic accuracy
during life 
The UK National Institute of Health and Care
Excellence NICE European and US diagnostic
17 recommend that structural imaging
 non contrast enhanced CT or ideally MRI should
be performed in the evaluation of patients with suspected dementia In recognition of advances in
imaging research the justication for this has
shifted from the exclusion of surgical pathology
 eg cerebral tumours although still relevant to
the inclusion of features that help to support a clinical diagnosis of the underlying cause s of the
dementia MRI offers a number of advantages over
 and is the imaging modality of choice in identifying diagnostic imaging features 14 15 17 While
no structural imaging features have perfect sensitivity
and specicity for any given diagnosis there are a
number which provide positive predictive value and
help to narrow the differential diagnosis to the most
likely underlying pathologies By describing these
characteristic MRI ndings in the context of a structured algorithm this article aims to provide clinicians
with a practical means of extracting useful imaging
features of common dementias in order to improve
diagnostic accuracy While neuroradiology expertise
is invaluable in accurate scan interpretation there is
much that a non radiologist can gain from a focused
and structured approach to scan analysis 
SYSTEMATIC ASSESSMENT OF STRUCTURAL
IMAGING
Beyond the exclusion of surgical pathology structural
MRI in patients with suspected dementia should be
assessed in terms of signal change on MRI and cerebral atrophy in a systematic fashion 19 The assessment
of signal change using weighted imaging or uid
attenuated inversion recovery FLAIR can be used to
help identify vascular damage but can also indicate
inammatory metabolic toxic or infective processes
which may be contributing to cognitive decits The
presence and topographical pattern of cerebral
atrophy has pathologically proven positive predictive value for dementia 20 Based on these two broad

categories a systematic approach to identifying diagnostically relevant imaging features which provide support for clinical diagnosis 
is presented in gure 1 and discussed in detail below and
expanded in gures 2 and 3 Using the predominant imaging features of the most common causes of dementia the diagnosis with
the greatest likelihood is presented  presents mostly
pathologically proven imaging examples of many of the features
described 
THE ALGORITHM
Exclusion of surgical pathology
The exclusion of a structural brain lesion potentially amenable
to surgical intervention should be the starting point when
reviewing structural imaging These include tumour eg meningioma glioma subdural haematoma arteriovenous malformation and hydrocephalus Idiopathic normal pressure
hydrocephalus should also be considered although imaging
markers have not yet proved sensitive enough for reliable
diagnosis 21 22
Assessment of signal change
Signal intensity within a single tissue type should be reasonably
uniform on MRI The presence of regions of hyperintensity or
hypointensity within the tissue typically reects pathology In
the context of a suspected dementia punctate or conuent
regions of signal change within white matter or deep grey
matter are most commonly associated with vascular pathology 
but rarely and in the correct clinical context may also indicate
inammatory metabolic or infective processes The prevalence
of vascular cognitive impairment VCI is second only to AD 
They share many risk factors including an increasing prevalence
with age and therefore in many patients vascular and degenerative pathology coexist 23 The exact interaction between neurodegenerative and vascular pathology is debated but critically for
the patient it is important that vascular risk factors are
managed and treated Differentiating the relative contribution of
vascular from neurodegenerative pathology as the cause of a
patients cognitive problems is a common clinical problem
where MRI plays a central role If MRI is not possible CT can
also be used relatively effectively to evaluate the presence and
extent of cerebrovascular disease with changes in white matter
appearing hypodense 
Clinical and research guidelines require imaging evidence of
cerebrovascular disease for a diagnosis of vascular dementia
 VaD or VCI to be made 23 24 In the absence of evidence of
vascular damage on MRI a vascular cause for cognitive impairment is very unlikely conversely extensive vascular changes are
very likely to produce signicant cognitive decits 25 The clinical difculty lies in determining whether a mild or moderate
degree of vascular changes is sufcient to explain the clinical
picture particularly in older people where mixed vascular and
neurodegenerative pathology is more common While it remains
important to address treatable vascular risk factors treating a
potential neurodegenerative condition for example with cholinesterase inhibition should not be overlooked Serial imaging
may help identify the relative contributions and there is some
evidence that the rate of cognitive decline may provide further
evidence of the underlying pathology with patients with VaD
typically declining at a slower rate than patients with neurodegenerative pathology 26
 weighted images including FLAIR are most useful in
detecting ischaemic changes while or susceptibility
weighted imaging can identify microbleeds suggestive of cerebral
amyloid angiopathy or arteriosclerotic small vessel disease
 SVD Diffusion weighted imaging may be useful in cases of
rapid cognitive decline suggestive of prion disease 
describes a systematic assessment of MR signal changes in the
context of dementia 
FLAIR hyperintensity
 Algorithmic assessment of MRI in dementia 
 Located in cerebral white matter Hyperintensities in cerebral
white matter on weighted or FLAIR imaging and less
prominently on weighted imaging are more likely to be
vascular in origin If deep grey matter and brainstem hyperintensities are also apparent the term subcortical hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin should be used 27 The
severity of hyperintensities can be visually quantied by
application of an established rating scale such as the
age related white matter changes or the Fazekas
scale 29 Conuence of hyperintensities in at least two
regions and the beginning of conuence of hyperintensities
in a further two regions is considered to represent the
involvement of at least a quarter of the total white matter
and is sufcient to assume SVD is the cause of VCI or
VaD 30 However even in cases of extensive white matter
hyperintensities the existence of mixed pathology should be
considered although it may be difcult to conrm or refute

Neurodegeneration
 An approach to signal change assessment in cognitive impairment 
Extension of conuent hyperintensities into the temporal
poles is rare and may indicate that the pathology is not of
conventional vascular origin If the patient has a positive
family history of dementing illness and is known to have suffered previously from strokes and or migraines cerebral
autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts
and leukoencephalopathy CADASIL should also be
considered and genetic testing may be 31 see
gure 4 Although a relatively rare form of dementia 
CADASIL is included here due to this fairly specic but not
entirely sensitive feature of non enhancing hyperintensities
extending in to the temporal poles with white matter
changes often appearing relatively more severe than expected
from the patients clinical appearance While temporal lobe

 Images demonstrating characteristic atrophy in several forms of pathologically proven dementia Displayed as clinical
diagnosispathology diagnosis indicates pathology ndings not available 
extension raises the question of CADASIL it may also feature
in demyelinating conditions such as multiple sclerosis 32 If
demyelinating disease is a diagnostic consideration then contrast enhanced axial weighted brain scanning with
Gadolinium may demonstrate active new lesions 33 Less often 
multifocal conuent regions of hyperintensity in a patient with
suspected dementia may result from a number of other conditions including infections inammatory demyelinating diseases leukodystrophies or leukoencephalopathies 19 34
Infective processes may need consideration in immunocompromised patients at risk of opportunistic infections including
cerebral toxoplasmosis 35
 Strategic Infarcts FLAIR hyperintensities with corresponding hypointensity in strategic locations such as
arterial territories association areas and watershed carotid
territories may be sufcient to produce cognitive symptoms
which can be termed VaD due to large vessel disease 30 36
Hyperintensities with CSF like signal intensity on all MRI
sequences dark on and FLAIR bright on in the
region of a single deep perforating arteriole are likely to represent recent small deep brain infarcts 27 The inclusion of a
rim of hyperintensity on FLAIR images thought to reect
gliosis is sufcient to indicate a lacune of vascular origin 
and is useful to help distinguish them from prominent perivascular spaces 27 Additionally prominent perivascular
spaces will typically appear linear when imaged parallel to
the course of the vessel and round or ovoid with a diameter
generally smaller than 3 mm when imaged perpendicular to
the course of the vessel 27 Bilateral thalamic lesions are sufcient to imply VaD due to SVD 30 It should be noted that
 weighted images are more sensitive to signal change in
the thalamus than FLAIR images 37
 Striatum and or neocortex Although rare Creutzfeldt Jakob
disease is included in the algorithm as it has very characteristic MRI features hyperintensities in the cortex and or basal
ganglia particularly in the putamen best seen on FLAIR
imaging Diffusion weighted imaging sequences have greater
sensitivity to hyperintensities within these see
gure 4 which may be especially prominent in the early
stages of the disease when vacuoles are small resulting in
restricted diffusion 19 In rapidly progressive dementia where
there is doubt over the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt Jakob
disease contrast enhanced MRI scanning is recommended to
rule out alternative causes 
 No Regions of Hyperintensity The absence of hyperintensities on or FLAIR imaging indicates the patients symptoms are very unlikely to be vascular in origin 
Neurodegenerative pathology therefore remains the most
likely cause of cognitive impairment and structural imaging
should be assessed for atrophy 
 hypointensity
 gradient echo or susceptibility weighted imaging is required
in order to detect cerebral microhaemorrhages or microbleeds
 CMBs Radiologically these are dened as small rounded 
homogeneous hypointense lesions 39 while pathologically they
have been found to represent focal leakage of blood breakdown
products from abnormal small blood vessels 40 The location of
CMBs broadly reects their underlying cause with CMBs associated with hypertension developing in deep brain regions basal
ganglia thalamus and brainstem while the distribution of CMBs
associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy eg in AD is mostly
cortical subcortical lobar 19 see gure 4 although the two conditions often coexist in elderly subjects 41 42 A conservative estimate from a large population based study suggests the incidence
of microbleeds in the general population is approximately 10 43
 hypointensities may also result from calcication iron
deposits from causes other than CMBs haemorrhagic metastasis or diffuse axonal injury Care should also be taken to exclude
MR artefacts such as ow voids or signals from temporal bones

Neurodegeneration
Cerebral atrophy assessment
Atrophy is the principal imaging nding in neurodegenerative
dementias and is typically best identied on weighted images
and assessed on a combination of axial sagittal and coronal
views Despite a degree of overlap among disease subtypes 
some patterns of atrophy are indicative of specic underlying
pathology however such ndings should be considered in the
context of the patients age and clinical examination 
sets out an approach to the assessment of cerebral atrophy 
Focal lobar atrophy
Atrophy with a focal lobar predominance is a useful starting
point to help narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with
cognitive decline In particular an asymmetrical pattern of
atrophy left greater than right or vice versa or more anterior
than posterior atrophy is more suggestive of underlying FTLD
pathology rather than AD pathology 
 Frontal lobe Disproportionate frontal lobe atrophy is associated with FTLD pathology but does not differentiate
between different FTLD histopathologies eg Picks disease
or corticobasal degeneration CBD Patients with behavioural variant FTD bvFTD may have symmetrical or asymmetrical frontal atrophy with or without additional temporal
lobe atrophy 4446 Despite a typically asymmetric clinical
presentation symmetrical frontal lobe atrophy is the predominant imaging nding in patients with dementia due to CBD
pathology 4749 However many patients with a clinical diagnosis of corticobasal syndrome are found to have pathology
other than CBD at postmortem 50 which may account for
some of the variability reported in the literature Currently
imaging features are not included in the diagnostic criteria
for CBD 51 Left sided posterior frontoinsular atrophy which
may be limited to a subtle widening of the left sylvian ssure 
is typically found in cases of progressive non uent
 52 see gure 4 
 Temporal lobe Asymmetric temporal atrophy is most commonly due to FTLD pathology but can also be due to AD 
The semantic dementia variant of FTD has a characteristic
pattern of loss typically left greater than right focal anterior
temporal atrophy particularly involving the temporal pole
 which progresses to knife edge atrophy the amygdala and
anterior hippocampus and often selective loss of anterior
fusiform gyrus with relative preservation of more posterior
structures 44 45 5254 Asymmetrical atrophy of the right temporal lobe with a similar distribution to SD may also occur 
most commonly presenting as bvFTD and often with additional features of prosopagnosia and or topographical
memory impairment 55 While the asymmetry is usually dramatic in SD and the right temporal variant of bvFTD both
temporal lobes usually become involved and over time the
pattern of atrophy may start to look more symmetrical see
gure 4 45 56 57 Logopenic aphasia LPA is also associated
with greater left sided atrophy in the temporal lobe although
in contrast to SD the pattern of atrophy extends more posteriorly than in SD predominantly affecting the posterior perisylvian and temporoparietal areas angular gyrus posterior
middle temporal gyrus superior temporal gyrus and superior
temporal sulcus 44 58 see gure 4 Unlike the majority of
clinical syndromes associated with an asymmetrical pattern of
atrophy LPA is typically found to be a result of AD pathology 49 Nonetheless the presence of an anterior posterior
atrophy gradient in the temporal lobe is suggestive of FTLD
rather than AD and can usefully be assessed by scrolling
posterior to anterior through coronal slices of the temporal lobe 
 Parietal Occipital lobe Posterior cortical atrophy PCA 
involving the parietal occipital cortex is usually the result of
underlying AD pathology see gure 4 however the differential diagnosis includes CBD DLB and other less common
causes PCA with additional medial temporal lobe MTL 
atrophy supports AD as the most likely cause however the
MTL may initially be relatively spared in posterior variant
AD PCA especially in early onset cases 59 Visual rating of
posterior atrophy in combination with MTL atrophy rating
has been reported to help discriminate AD from FTD and
AD from normal ageing with a sensitivity of 73 and specicity of 87 60 Gross frontoparietal atrophy extending into
the temporal lobe conned to a single hemisphere has been
described in patients with progranulin mutations and should
be considered in the presence of a strong family history 6163
Focal hippocampal atrophy
Hippocampal atrophy is the most established imaging biomarker
of AD and as a result has now been incorporated in to diagnostic criteria 14 16 17 The sensitivity and specicity of visual rating of
MTL atrophy are approximately 80 when mild AD cases are
compared with elderly control subjects 64 Relative preservation of
the MTL is suggested as a means of distinguishing DLB from AD
at a group level 65 however this may not be true of older patients
or patients with advanced DLB and may not be reliable in individual see gure 4 particularly as many patients with DLB
pathology also have AD pathology at postmortem 67 Dopamine
transporter imaging offers greater utility in distinguishing DLB
from AD 68 Hippocampal atrophy is also a feature of hippocampal sclerosis and hyperintensity of the hippocampus on or
FLAIR images makes this diagnosis more likely Focal and often
severe atrophy affecting the anteromedial temporal lobes has
been described in tau mutation microtubule associated protein
tau MAPT carriers with striking loss of the amygdala parahippocampus and hippocampal heads 63 69 see gure 4 
Although more often asymmetrical bvFTD may also demonstrate
symmetrical MTL atrophy and or frontal lobe atrophy 45 56 57
Infratentorial atrophy
Progressive supranuclear palsy PSP can present as a dementia 
often with frontal features or occasionally with progressive nonuent aphasia Midbrain atrophy is characteristic of PSP and has
been described as having a hummingbird appearance in midsagittal slices see gure 4 with axial slices demonstrating the so
called mickey mouse sign Other imaging features in PSP
include dilation of the third ventricle and atrophy of the red
nucleus 70 Frontal atrophy may be subtle or marked in PSP 
Pontocerebellar atrophy may indicate other neurodegenerative
conditions such as multiple system atrophy which in rare cases
may present with a cognitive phenotype 19
Generalised atrophy
Global volume loss without focal lobar atrophy is a common
and non specic nding on structural MRI studies in normal
ageing and dementia and it can sometimes be difcult to determine where normal ageing ends and pathological atrophy
begins Symmetrical generalised atrophy ie left right anterior posterior is typically seen in AD and DLB and may also
accompany white matter changes in patients with vascular
disease 
Harper L et al J Neurol Neurosurg Psychiatry 2014 85 692698 doi 10 1136 
Neurodegeneration
No imaging abnormality demonstrated
When all stages fail to reveal any abnormalities beyond what is
expected for age the scan is reported as within normal limits 
This does not of course exclude dementia nor does it rule out a
neurodegenerative cause particularly if the clinical syndrome is
mild If clinical suspicion persists a SPECT single photon emission computed tomography or PET scan can be helpful to look
for changes in cerebral perfusion metabolism or repeat MRI
scanning in 612 months Normal imaging particularly with
repeat imaging after greater than 6 months should however
prompt consideration of a non neurodegenerative cause including psychiatric conditions In the future molecular diagnostic
indices such as CSF A142 or amyloid PET scanning may
increasingly be used to conrm or exclude the presence of AD
 amyloid pathology in these cases 
CONCLUSION
Clinical diagnosis of the cause of cognitive complaints or
decline can be difcult Nonetheless accurate and timely diagnosis is increasingly important to guide management and to
provide appropriate information and support As reected in
current diagnostic guidelines structural imaging can provide
valuable positive as well as negative predictive information and
the algorithm described here based on reported imaging features with greatest diagnostic value is designed to provide a systematic aid to help differentiate between the different causes of
dementia It is of course important that imaging ndings are
interpreted in the correct clinical context and that the limitations of making an individual diagnosis on the basis of imaging
ndings are recognised 
While the diagnostic approach we describe here is based on
visual assessment of structural imaging techniques such as volumetric quantication of brain structures and automated classier
algorithms may play a complementary role in future clinical
practice Brain volumetry is already used extensively in research
 and clinical and has the potential to be used at
the single patient level to help support diagnosis and monitor
disease progression 73
In the meantime structural imaging in cognitive cases can
provide easily accessible clinically useful information that can
be realistically assessed by the non specialist Using a systematic
approach such as set out in this article may help clinicians in
evaluating their own scans rather than relying on radiological
reports alone and ultimately support the diagnostic process 
Further work is however required to evaluate the sensitivity
and specicity of imaging signatures for neurodegenerative
pathology
