While the HILIC method was initially developed for the separation amino acids the successful separation GlcCer from
GalCer has also been reported using fused core silica and amino
column More recently HILIC based method using ultraperformance LC and supercritical uid chromatography has been
demonstrated discriminate sufciently between GlcCer and GalCer brain tissue samples While these approaches have
been used quantify both GlcCer and GalCer they suffer from substantial variability among different samples Consequently

A zwitterionic ZIC stationary phase consists oppositely
charged groups and phase that can used separate phospholipid classes based electrostatic interactions In general 
 ZIC stationary phase retains thick hydration layer that generates strong hydrophilic interactions with analytes This feature
facilitates the separation congurational isomers and the discrimination hydroxylated molecules such glycopeptides and
carbohydrates 
In the present study evaluated the efcacy ZIC HILIC

method for the quantitative analysis GlcCer brain tissue and
demonstrated that highly suitable for analyzing other glycolipids such PtdGlc and PtdIns Additionally the successful
discrimination complex epidermal GlcCer mixtures based

Results and discussion
 Optimization and reproducibility
HILIC separation lipids usually achieved with mobile phases
composed acetonitrile water volatile solvent
 For example bacterial phospholipids are separated ZIC HILIC with mobile phase containing water 
In the present study selected acetonitrile water mixture
 containing mM ammonium formate which sufciently
retained GlcCer and PtdGlc samples the column In order 
ensure reproducible results the column was regenerated with acetonitrile water prior each analysis 
The reproducibility elution times and peak areas was conrmed analyzing synthetic mixture PtdGlc and
PtdIns Over seven runs the results were highly reproducible Fig with retention time coefcients variation CV 
for PtdGlc and PtdIns The peak area CVs PtdGlc and
PtdIns were and respectively This represents signicant improvement compared with our previously reported method
based normal phase chromatography with chloroform based
solvent system demonstrating the suitability ZIC HILIC 
reliably quantify PtdGlc

Next compared the chromatographic behaviors standard
reference materials such HexCers phosphatidyl hexosides and
PtdIns Fig unmodied silica gel HILIC with ZIC HILIC 
The HexCer species with and 
were monitored the following MRM pairs 
 and respectively using product ions 
the dehydration sphingolipid base On ZICHILIC Fig A glucose featuring HexCer species were eluted
after their corresponding galactose analogs mutually separating GlcCer and GalCer species Phosphatidyl hexosides exhibited
the same carbohydrate dependent elution pattern Fig B Fig 
 indicated their respective retention factors for PtdGlc
 and PtdGal The
preferential retention glucosylated lipids compared with their
galactosylated analogs was also observed sulfobetaine stationary phase Fig By contrast unmodied silica gel
HILIC stationary phase galactosylated glycolipids were preferentially retained indicated the respective retention factors for
PtdGlc compared with PtdGal Taken together 
the preferential retention glucosylated compared with galactosylated glycolipids appears due the hydrophilic interactions
that occur with increased thickness the hydration layer the
stationary phase 
The effect the fatty acid chain pattern the retention times
was strikingly similar all columns used In general increasing the
fatty acyl chain length weakened analyte retention and resulted
 reduced retention times For example both GlcCer and GalCer
featuring ceramide moiety were eluted later than
their ceramide featuring analogs By contrast alteration the stereoconguration the glycerol moiety gave almost
identical retention factors Fig B Acetylated PtdGlc 
 O acetylation was weakly retained the column and therefore
eluted earlier than that non acetylated PtdGlc Inositides such
 PtdIns and lyso PtdIns were eluted later than
their respective glucoside and galactoside analogs all employed
systems Together these results correspond well our previously
reported observations using normal phase chromatography 
 Analysis hexosylceramides brain tissue
To demonstrate the applicability our ZIC HILIC method over
 broad range biologically relevant concentrations the monohexosylceramide content present total lipid extracts from whole
mouse brain tissue postnatal day and adult weekold mice was quantied In contrast the large amount GalCer
present adult mouse brain mouse brain tissue contains only
 small amount The integrity our brain samples was conrmed with boric acid impregnated TLC plate and migration
with standards As expected low amounts HexCers were found
 mouse brain tissue and GalCer was predominantly found
 adult mouse brain Fig A The MRM proles Fig B GlcCer
species indicated asterisks demonstrated that regardless the
large amount GalCer GlcCer was still well resolved 
The major fatty acid present GlcCer from mouse brain
was stearic acid Fig B light green whereas the
predominant fatty acid GalCer from adult mouse brain was 
nervonic acid residue In adult mouse brain the preference for long chain fatty acids GalCer preserved GalCer
featuring hydroxylated OHFA long chain fatty acids exhibited longer retention time compared their non hydroxylated
 non OHFA analogs OHFAs are characteristically present

To evaluate the reproducibility our HILIC methods the HexCer species extracted from month old mouse brains Table 
were repeatedly analyzed An unnatural GlcCer was
added validate the feasibility the extraction method Its recovery was also appropriately Across four samples
the relative standard deviations RSD ZIC HILIC were reproducible with range The unmodied silica gel
HILIC RSDs were within In both cases the determined concentration low abundant constituents such GlcCer
 GlcCer and GlcCer was
comparable although their respective RSDs were relatively high 
Taken together these results demonstrate that our method sufciently robust for the quantication GlcCer biological samples 
such brain tissue 
 Distribution HexCer brain
Imaging mass spectrometry powerful tool for determining
the spatial distribution lipids the brain Because the isobaric nature HexCer this technique incapable discriminating
between different carbohydrate moieties thus precluding the analysis minor GlcCer species Using our ZIC HILIC method 
the concentrations species HexCer were determined
 seven different regions adult mouse brain olfactory bulb 
hypothalamus cerebellum medulla oblongata hippocampus cortex and other regions Fig and Table In each region the
total amount GalCer exceeded GlcCer The medulla oblongata
and hippocampus were especially rich GalCer but poor GlcCer In contrast olfactory bulb hypothalamus cortex and other
regions exhibited the highest GlcCer content but the lowest GalCer content Thus the distribution GlcCer compared GalCer
 brain regions exhibited inverse relationship rationalizing the
variation GalCer excess between and fold compared 
GlcCer 
In terms fatty acid modication the ceramide moiety sizeable amounts palmitic acid were detected the GlcCer
fraction isolated from the olfactory bulb Fig red Stearic acid
 was the main fatty acid found the four GlcCer rich regions
 Fig light green By contrast the highest content stearic
acid featuring GalCer was the medulla oblongata and
hippocampus coinciding with the lowest content stearic acid
 featuring modied GlcCer A similar inverse pattern was
observed for arachidic acid behenic acid and lignoceric acid despite their relatively low content GlcCer
and GalCer Nervonic acid the major fatty acid modication found GalCer which specically enriched the medulla
oblongata and hippocampus Fig blue In the case GlcCer nervonic acid featuring species were distributed evenly Hydroxy
fatty acids were found only the GalCer fraction with the highest
content the olfactory bulb

Fig HILIC ESIMS MS lipid mixtures extracted from mouse epidermis A Extracted ion chromatograms generated neutral loss scan Detected peaks were divided
into three classes based retention times ZIC HILIC and unmodied silica gel column and B Mass spectra eluted around each group Class was
separated into two peaks ZIC HILIC GlcCer species with HFA GlcCer species with trihydroxy sphingoid base 
This heterogeneous distribution HexCer species likely 
related their region specic function For example substantial part white matter composed myelin sheath tissue that
 rich nervonic acid featuring GalCer Consequently the
high content GalCer with nervonic acid species the medulla
oblongata and hippocampus correlate well with the high content
 white matter these regions the brain Therefore the distinct
HexCer composition each analyzed brain region and the considerable uctuation their respective regional content highlights the
importance quantifying local alterations HexCer composition
 the onset and during the progression neurodegenerative diseases such Parkinson disease If slight differences GlcCer levels
need measured further during disease progression samples should also analyzed with the HILIC ESIMS MS method
combined with ion mobility system which are currently
developing Taken together our ZIC HILIC method exceptionally suitable for analyzing signicant differences minor GlcCer
content across different brain regions 
 Qualitative analysis hexosylceramide skin
In general the epidermis composed complex mixture 
hexosylceramides with considerable diversity their ceramide
moiety This includes the presence additional hydroxyl group
 the position the fatty acid residue the long
chain base sphingoid base moieties such hydroxysphinganine
 hydroxysphingosine By contrast the carbohydrate
moiety lacks diversity limited primarily glucose 
Consequently characterization the HexCer mixture mouse
epidermis samples ideal for demonstrating the versatility our
method discriminate compounds based differences their
ceramide moiety To assess the complexity the ceramide moieties detected and characterized HexCers based LC retention
times and values neutral loss scan The neutral loss Da
has been previously associated with the loss hexosyl residue
 cleavage its glycosidic linkage 
Three distinct classes and HexCers were clearly
separated our ZIC HILIC method based differences their
ceramide moiety Fig A Class seemed lack any additional
hydroxylation but did possess variety fatty acid residues
between Fig B ZIC HILIC and Table Class 
and were exclusively composed HexCer with additional
hydroxyl group The min shift the retention time class 
compared with class and the observed values were indicative additional hydroxyl group either the position
 the fatty acid residue HFA OHFA OHFA By contrast 
 values class corresponded known sphingolipids with
 trihydroxy long chain base such hydroxy sphinganine and
 hydroxy sphingosine 
For comparison used unmodied silica gel HILIC column
 analyze the epidermal HexCer mixture Fig A This method
resolved classes and which correspond non hydroxylated
HexCer and class which corresponds mixture fatty
acids and long chain base hydroxylated HexCer Interestingly the
ions present class were predominantly Da heavier than
the ions present class indicating higher degree saturation the long chain base moiety For example the value 
 and corresponded GlcCer 
and GlcCer respectively Thus the method using
 unmodied silica gel column was capable discriminating
between GlcCer species with sphingosine and those with sphinganine However the full characterization unidentied
signals such and will require additional
experiments Fig A Table Additionally minor components
such GlcCer containing OHFA and trihydroxy sphingoid bases
should characterized Currently are also developing twodimensional HILIC MS method combined with reversed phase
mode efciently characterize minor GlcCer species These results

Conclusions
We established and validated the reproducibility novel
ZIC HILIC based HPLCMS MS method for the analysis glycosphingolipids and glycophospholipids The preferred retention
 Ins Glc Gal allowed the outright identication the carbohydrate moiety despite their isobaric nature Additionally GlcCer 
the minor component brain samples was condently analyzed 
even the presence times excess GalCer In skin samples our ZIC HILIC method demonstrated its potential resolve
fatty acid and long chain base hydroxylation Comparison our
new method with unmodied silica gel HILIC column revealed
 inverted retention prole and separation characteristics with
respect the lipid moiety Thus our approach with two HILIC
methods successfully quantied glucosylated lipids brain and
