Introduction
Mild cognitive impairment MCI dened abnormal
cognitive state but does not meet the criteria for the
diagnosis dementia In the past MCI was treated 
transitional state between the physiological aging and
dementia Currently separate diagnosis although 
 considered that MCI stage pathophysiological
process AD Patients with MCI not have problems
with function daily life sometimes they only need
minimal aid Patient diagnosed with MCI can present
stable non progressive symptoms until the end his life 
but there can also observed progression the disease
 usually gradual leading the development dementia It
 estimated that the percentage the conversion 
Alzheimers disease AD about per year 
Criteria for diagnosis MCI from addition 
core clinical criteria distinguish research criteria The
research criteria include assessment the biological
markers neurons injury namely 
 markers amyloid Ab deposition assessing the levels
 cerebrospinal uid PET amyloid imaging
 markers neuronal injury evaluating the levels total
and phosphorylated tau protein reduction hippocampal volume atrophy the medial temporal lobe the
magnetic resonance imaging hypometabolism FDGPET hypoperfusion SPECT 
These criteria are important because pathophysiological
process AD can last even twenty years before onset 
clinical symptoms and MCI considered stage this
pathophysiological processes following the preclinical phase
 Alzheimers disease In MCI phase biomarkers should 
already positive both markers Ab deposition and markers 
neuronal injury A sensitive biomarker will play key role when
causative treatment AD will found because then will 
possible treat this disease even before the onset clinical
symptoms 
The aim this study was investigate the usefulness 
structural brain magnetic resonance imaging with volumetric
assessment the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex 
posterior cingulate gyrus parahippocampal gyrus temporal
gyri superior medial and inferior predict the conversion 
MCI AD 
The rst abnormalities patients who are risk AD are
positive markers deposition amyloid decreased Ab
concentration the cerebrospinal uid and positive PET
amyloid imaging In this study the marker neuronal injury
was used structural MRI with volumetric assessment 
selected brain structures inter alia hippocampus entorhinal
cortex because good availability magnetic resonance 
Poland the best neuroimaging biomarkers and its noninvasive nature Furthermore according Jack the MRI
pathological changes are observed one the last
biomarkers and our patients were not the preclinical
phase they were diagnosed with MCI Reduction the
measured volumes was expected patients who were risk
 conversion AD 
Material and methods
In the study initially participated patients diagnosed with
MCI who were evaluated Alzheimers Department MSW
Hospital Warsaw patients remained for further data

measurements the left hippocampus and left entorhinal
cortex the prediction MCI progression AD was 
Sensitivity for these measurements predicting the stable
form MCI was the same using all the measured
parameters namely and diagnosis classication accuracy using left hippocampus and left entorhinal cortex was
 for all measurements The highest sensitivity 
predicting MCI conversion AD using single measurement
was for left hippocampus right hippocampus 
and left entorhinal cortex 
Discussion
In descriptive statistics presented Table average
volumes all structures are smaller converters comparing
 non converters according the preliminary assumptions However statistical analysis showed the superiority 
some measurements The highest sensitivity conversion
for single structure was obtained for the left hippocampus
 right hippocampus and left entorhinal cortex
 also Unsuitable measurements for assessing MCI 
AD conversion were the volumes left and right posterior
cingulate gyrus left and right superior temporal gyrus and
right medial temporal gyrus the sensitivity was Our
results are consistent with the sequence neuropathological
changes described Braak where entorhinal cortex and
hippocampus are affected the rst the neuropathological process and subsequently cortex temporal lobes 
stage III and IV Volumes superior temporal gyri proved 
 unsuitable probably because their main role the
process auditory sensation their role cognitive
processes signicantly lower The most the published
studies has evaluated usefulness hippocampus and
entorhinal cortex volumes the prediction MCI conversion AD Our study also conrms the highest value these
two parameters Studies which assessed additionally for
example volume parahippocampal gyrus indicated that
the use this parameter did not increase prediction
sensitivity for conversion AD In our study the use
 all measured volumes increased sensitivity from 
 where the volume the left hippocampus and left
entorhinal cortex was used Specicity both
cases was Signicant differences between the sensitivity and specicity gures resulted from subgroup size
difference converters and with stable MCI In other
studies the percentage conversion AD was higher 
namely In the few studies the most
sensitive volumetric measurement was entorhinal cortex
volume In our study left entorhinal cortex volume was less
sensitive measurement comparison with left hippocampus volume the Ewers work Patients with MCI are
 heterogeneous group and may different stages 
neuropathological process that why use hippocampus
and entorhinal cortex volumes seems the most optimal
method Volumetric measurements hippocampus entorhinal cortex posterior cingulate gyrus parahippocampal
gyrus and temporal gyri superior medial inferior showed 
relatively low sensitivity predicting the conversion MCI
 AD the analysis all measurements Higher
sensitivity was obtained for predicting stable MCI 
The limitation our study was the number patients
 Studies which drew from either ADNI database the
Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative AddNeuroMed program present the results from signicantly larger
groups patients For example Risacher analyzed
 patients with MCI from ADNI database converted
into AD per year Bilateral hippocampal volumes entorhinal
cortex and temporal gyri thickness were signicantly reduced
 MCI converters comparison the MCI stable participants which consistent with our results except for the left
superior temporal gyrus LSTG Table In our study the
volume LSTG was not signicantly lower but Risarcher
study the thickness not volume temporal gyri was
measured Another study based ADNI database Li
 covered patients with MCI and the observation
period lasted years To predict conversion from MCI AD the
authors used not only the measured volumes but also
demographic genetic information cognitive scores and the
results laboratory tests They employed hierarchical
interaction model select the most predictive biosignatures
and interactions between all the parameters perform
correct classication the patients with MCI converter nonconverter The accuracy classication was almost the
most effective MRI parameters were precuneus amygdala 
entorhinal cortex and hippocampus Percentage the correct
classication our study using all volumes was but
sensitivity was only Higher correct classication rate
 our study was probably due the large differences between
subgroups converters non converters In Lis study
conversion rate was converters nonconverters subgroups were almost equivalent 
The study from presents results using data from
both mentioned databases ADNI and AddNeuroMed and
involved patients with MCI The authors used ordinal
regression model baseline structural MRI scans They
modeled all classes simultaneously study were also AD
patients and control group and applied multivariate ordinal
regression from which they extract probabilistic prediction
 class membership and index AD progression the
ORCHID score Classication accuracy was ADNIAddNeuroMed sensitivity and specicity 
This study conrmed results from which
multivariate classication methods for MRI was used Data
was from AddNeuroMed database MCI group was patients
 like our study and patients converted into AD during
one year observation The authors compared correct classication accuracy between visual assessment rating scales 
multivariate MRI classication method with using regional
volume and regional cortical thickness measures providing 
variables for multivariate analysis and manually measured
hippocampal volumes The best accuracy for predicting
conversion was for the model with automated regional MRI
measures and accuracy was obtained other two
methods Comparable group size with our study proved that
using sophisticated statistical tools can improve the efciency
 the method 
Our study group requires further observation because 
the following years the proportion the patients who
