The entorhinal cortex EC and the hippocampal formation HF are part the mesial temporal lobe memory
system the EC connects the neocortex with the HF
via the perforant path thereby providing the latter with
multimodal sensory information These brain regions have
received special attention investigations the pathophysiology AD since memory dysfunction one its
earliest hallmarks 
Post mortem pathological studies have implicated the EC
and the transentorhinal region early sites involvement
 AD and individuals with mild cognitive impairment
 However the EC has received less attention vivo investigations partly due the fact that
MRI derived quantitative protocols for this structure were
only recently developed

Atrophy the HF region important for the acquisition
 certain types new information declarative knowledge has been well documented AD using quantitative
volumetric MRI analyses 
 More recently atrophy the EC was demonstrated 
AD with MRI based quantitation its volume Yet 
while vivo anatomical investigations using structural MRI
are rapidly proliferating relatively few volumetric studies
have focused strictly patients the earliest stages AD
 those with mild cognitive impairment see for example 
Two studies that measured the entire parahippocampal
gyrus failed detect significant atrophy this structure 
patients with clinical diagnosis very mild AD 
In these mild cases however there was significant hippocampal atrophy These results were initially somewhat
surprising given the early pathological involvement the
entorhinal and transentorhinal cortices the disease process In the two studies cited above parahippocampal gyrus
volume included both white and gray matter and the case
 the report from our laboratory measurements continued beyond the anatomical boundaries the entorhinal
and perirhinal cortices As result any changes the EC
itself may have been masked It was therefore important 
use newly developed protocols for the quantitation the
EC order examine its involvement patients with
very mild incipient AD 
In addition patients with very mild AD individuals 
high risk for AD are now being studied order identify
anatomical changes that precede clinical diagnosis and 
develop sensitive vivo markers that might predictive 
conversion AD One such group consists those patients
who have cognitive complaints cognitive impairment 
both but who not meet diagnostic criteria for dementia
after thorough evaluation Such groups are special
interest since they provide information the transitional
state between normal aging and AD although definitions
and designations this subgroup have varied 
 A number investigations have suggested that when
followed longitudinally these individuals are increased
risk for developing AD Furthermore 
there increased risk for incident dementia among elderly
people with subjective informant corroborated memory
complaints even their baseline cognitive assessment 
normal 
Of the few MRI studies that have examined the volumes
 mesial temporal lobe structures elderly patients with
mild cognitive impairment age associated memory impairment some have found hippocampal atrophy 
 while others have not Two recent investigations that assessed MRI based entorhinal volume such
patients found significant EC atrophy compared controls
The present research was undertaken compare the
extent MRI derived hippocampal and entorhinal atrophy
 very mild and incipient AD attempt determine the
earliest sites pathological involvement the disease
process and develop vivo anatomical markers 
Materials and methods
 Subjects
Data reported here were obtained from the following
three groups participants healthy elderly normal
control subjects NC patients who were evaluated for
cognitive complaints but who did not meet clinical criteria
for dementia they are referred here non demented
patients ND and patients with very mild probable
AD The major difference between the ND patients and the
elderly controls that the patients were recruited from 
clinic where they were being evaluated for possible dementia whereas the elderly controls were recruited from the
general population and had meet the criteria described
below 
 Clinical work 
All evaluations were carried out the Rush Alzheimers
Disease Center RADC Chicago IL previously described Briefly the evaluation incorporated the
Consortium Establish Registry for Alzheimers Disease
 CERAD procedures and included medical history 
neurological examination neuropsychological testing informant interview and blood tests 
The clinical diagnosis probable AD followed
NINCDS ADRDA guidelines required history 
cognitive decline and neuropsychological test evidence 
impairment least two cognitive domains one which
had memory In the present study only included
patients with diagnosis probable AD whose Mini Mental State Examination MMSE score was 
those with very mild AD 
Patients the non demented group presented the
clinic with cognitive complaints received the same standard
evaluation the AD patients but did not meet clinical
criteria for dementia Exclusion criteria for both AD and ND
patients were evidence other neurologic psychiatric 
systemic conditions that could cause cognitive impairment
 stroke alcoholism major depression Neuropsychological test results indicated that the ND group included 
members with isolated memory impairment two members
with impairment attention one with language deficits and
 individuals without demonstrable cognitive deficits 
clinical testing It should noted that individual patient
 this group had deficit more than one domain Because
elderly individuals with complaints memory are high
risk developing AD even they not show significant
deficits formal testing did not exclude those ND
patients without demonstrable cognitive deficits for the purpose this study

 Acquisition and quantitation MRI data
All MR images were acquired Tesla General

taken spanning the entire brain with the following parameters matrix field view one

Manual segmentation with PC based image analysis
program Amersham Image Analysis System with software
designed Loates Associates was used compute volumes regions interest To correct for individual differences brain size entorhinal and hippocampal volumes
were normalized dividing with intracranial volume derived from sagittal slices To compute intracranial volume 
the inner table the cranium was traced consecutive
sagittal sections spanning the entire brain At the level the
foramen magnum straight line was drawn from the inner
surface the clivus the most anterior extension the
occipital bone 
EC volume was quantified with the use new protocol
developed and validated our laboratory technical details
 which are presented Goncharova accompanying manuscript The advantage this protocol that EC
volume measured from the same oblique coronal sections
most commonly used for hippocampal volumetry avoid
overestimation one these two adjacent structures the
expense the other 
Briefly both entorhinal and hippocampal volumes were
computed separately for the right and left hemispheres from
coronal slices taken perpendicular the long axis the
HF For the EC tracing began with the first section which
the gyrus ambiens amygdala and the white matter the
parahippocampal gyrus first appeared visible The superomedial border rostral sections was the sulcus semiannularis and caudal sections the subiculum The shoulder 
the collateral sulcus was used the lateral border The
latter somewhat conservative criterion that allowed
consistency tracings and avoided the use different
lateral borders depending individual differences the
depth the collateral sulcus see for example ref In
the majority cases tracings were carried out 
sections Validation procedures well inter and intra

measure the volumes the entorhinal cortex right and hippocampal

rater reliability scores for EC measurements are described 
Goncharova accompanying paper 
The protocol and validation procedures used for quantifying hippocampal volume were published previously 
 Tracings the HF started with the first section where
the dentate gyrus could clearly identified and included
the fimbria dentate gyrus the hippocampus proper and the
subiculum All sections which the hippocampus could 
clearly seen without partial volume averaging were included
 usually slices

 Statistical analyses
Group differences were evaluated with the use either
one way two way repeated measures analyses variance ANOVA followed post hoc comparisons with the
studentized range test Logistic regression analyses were
performed determine how well hippocampal and entorhinal volume could predict group membership 
Results

repeated measures ANOVAs with group and hemisphere 
the two factors The analysis entorhinal volume showed
significant group F and hemisphere F effects but significant interaction between them The hemisphere effect can
 accounted for larger right EC all three groups 
Pairwise comparisons indicated that both the ND patients
and those with mild AD differed significantly from controls

The ANOVA hippocampal volume also showed significant group F and hemisphere
F effects without significant
interaction between them However this case pairwise
comparisons demonstrated that the two patient groups dif 
fered total hippocampal volume from controls well 
from each other with the very mild AD group
showing the greatest atrophy 
Logistic regression analyses were then performed determine how well hippocampal and entorhinal volume could
predict group membership In these analyses total EC and

 the model In this case hippocampal volume did not add
significantly predictions based EC volume the latter
alone correctly classified all subjects the two
groups 
In contrast when comparing patients with very mild AD
 ND cases the prediction based hippocampal volume
alone suggested improvement over the prediction based 
EC volume alone Entorhinal
volume did not contribute any additional ability classify
patients with AD Again the volume each area interest
predicted group membership significantly when examined
alone but more subjects could classified accurately using
hippocampal volume 
The comparison patients with very mild AD and
control subjects indicated that both entorhinal and hippocampal volume contributed significantly the model 
The model with both predictors classified the cases
correctly 
The results the logistic regression analyses did not
change when adjusted for age sex Taken together they
indicate that the primary difference between the controls
and ND patients entorhinal volume while hippocampal
atrophy plays more important role differentiating AD
patients from the ND cases 
Follow clinical evaluations available the 
ND participants included this study indicated that 
the had converted since the initial clinical and MRI
evaluation and received clinical diagnosis probable AD 
The follow period ranged from months mean 
 and was equivalent for converters and non converters
 See Table Entorhinal and
hippocampal volumes derived from the baseline MRI
showed that converters differed significantly from non converters total right left entorhinal volume 
 but not hippocampal volume see Fig 
Further logistic regressions using total hippocampal and
entorhinal volume predictors only EC volume was 
significant predictor the likelihood conversion odds

Thus for every unit decrease EC volume the chances

entorhinal volume alone was used predictor 
converters and non converters were correctly classified 
It interesting note that among the ND patients
who converted had memory impairment had attentional deficits and one did not show any demonstrable cognitive deficits clinical testing Of the non demented
participants who did not convert AD four had memory
impairment and seven had demonstrable cognitive impairment clinical testing 
Discussion
A major strength our study the inclusion extremely mild cases AD and comparison the anatomical changes detected vivo these mild cases with those
observed patients who not meet diagnostic criteria but
are risk for AD 
Individuals risk for AD are interest since they
provide valuable information the transitional state between normal aging and AD Different investigators have
used different definitions characterize this population 
although recently criteria for mild cognitive impairment
have been more stringently formulated These criteria include objective memory impairment Thus the difference between the ND group the present study and mild
cognitive impairment defined Petersen and colleagues
 that included some individuals who presented
 the clinic with subjective cognitive complaints but did
not show objective deficits Our reason for including them
was that they have been shown high risk for AD 
well Although recognize the limitations our
approach interest note that the rate conversion
observed the ND group this study very similar the
rate reported Petersen for those diagnosed with mild
cognitive impairment 
The results described above showed that both patient
groups mild AD and ND differed from controls entorhinal volume but not from each other In contrast the two
patient groups differed from controls hippocampal volume well from each other with the AD cases showing
the greatest atrophy Taken together these findings suggest
that degeneration the EC and HF occurs before the onset
 obvious dementia and that HF atrophy associated with
the progression from mild subjective objective cognitive
impairment AD Although the ND group showed significant atrophy both structures logistic regression models
demonstrated that entorhinal volume was better than hippocampal volume differentiating these patients from controls suggesting that the EC becomes pathologically involved before the HF On the other hand the extent 
hippocampal atrophy was better differentiating patients
with very mild AD from ND cases atrophy both structures played equivalent role differentiating patients
with very mild AD from controls 
The lack significant difference between the two
patient groups entorhinal volume and the fact that the ND
cases could best differentiated from controls EC
volume further suggest that MRI based entorhinal atrophy
may provide vivo marker incipient AD This suggestion strongly supported the fact that converters 
AD among the ND participants could best differentiated
from non converters the basis entorhinal volume 
Our findings hippocampal atrophy patients with
very mild AD are general agreement with most the
published literature date In numerous studies MRbased volumetric estimates mesial temporal lobe structures AD HF atrophy has been shown one the
most robust and consistently documented findings 
 However only few groups
have focused their investigations patients with very mild
AD 
The literature less clear cut with respect alterations
 hippocampal volume patients with isolated memory
complaints mild cognitive impairment compared controls Our finding hippocampal atrophy the ND group
 consistent with results reported two other laboratories
 However two studies published another group
failed find significant hippocampal atrophy such patients 
A likely reason for this inconsistency selection criteria 
Most groups reporting MR volumetric studies elderly
patients with mild cognitive impairment age associated
memory impairment have selected their subjects neuro 
B C Dickerson Neurobiology Aging 
psychological test scores some have focused clinic populations while others have studied community derived samples 
The investigators reporting absence significant hippocampal atrophy obtained their sample from communitybased population which was later shown have only 
incidence dementia years follow Therefore likely that their group contained greater number 
subjects who were not the incipient phases AD the time
MRI scans were acquired 
Our volumetric results EC atrophy AD are 
agreement with those reported other laboratories 
 They are also agreement with two very recent papers
reporting that individuals with mild memory impairment
show significant atrophy the EC compared controls
 However Killiany found that among the
participants with mild memory impairment what discriminated converters from non converters was the volumes 
the superior temporal sulcus and anterior cingulate but not
the EC One possible factor contributing the difference
between our findings converters and theirs may the
way which EC volume was derived The estimate EC
volume the Killiany paper was based 
tracings from three coronal sections while ours was
based much larger portion the structure 
In summary the vivo anatomical results presented here
are agreement with post mortem pathological studies and
underscore the early involvement the entorhinal cortex 
AD The results further suggest that the progression 
diagnosis AD requires significant atrophy the HF 
addition the EC Taken together our findings demonstrate the potential sensitive neuroimaging techniques for
the development early anatomical markers AD Such
predictive biological markers could great help for the
development and monitoring early interventions designed
 retard disease progression

Notes
We now use new protocol that acquires 
coronal images the entire head with SPGR pulse
sequence For purposes consistency and have
large enough group sizes the present study was restricted those patients and controls scanned with our
