To evaluate the precision of ZIC-HILIC, we quantiﬁed glucosyl- and galactosylceramides in seven different regions of the mouse brain and discovered that GlcCer and GalCer concentrations are inversely related.

GalCer is a component of myelin and plays a critical role in myelin-related functions , whereas GlcCer is involved in axonal growth [6,7]. On the other hand, PtdGlc, a novel glycerol-type glucosylated lipid, is a minor component of lipid rafts.

In non-neural tissues, GlcCer exhibits structural complexity, and each GlcCer species has distinctive functions, as in ceramide species.

More recently, a HILIC-based method using ultraperformance LC and supercritical ﬂuid chromatography has been demonstrated to discriminate sufﬁciently between GlcCer and GalCer in brain tissue samples [23,24].

While these approaches have been used to quantify both GlcCer and GalCer, they suffer from substantial variability among different samples [21-24]. Consequently, an alternative method with improved resolution of complex GlcCer would be highly desirable.

The successful discrimination of complex epidermal GlcCer mixtures based on their ceramide moieties via a two-column setup conﬁrmed the suitability of our ZIC-HILIC method for characterizing the carbohydrate and ceramide moieties of GlcCer simultaneously.

Total lipids were extracted from lyophilized tissues added with GlcCer containing 5 pmol/mg of lyophilized tissue, according to the method of Bligh and Dyer.

The major fatty acid present in GlcCer from P5 mouse brain was stearic acid, whereas the predominant fatty acid in GalCer from adult mouse brain was a nervonic acid residue.

Filled bars in A and B indicate GlcCer and GalCer with non-hydroxy fatty acid, and striped bars in B indicate GalCer with ␣OHFA. The content and variability for each compound are shown in Table S2. GalCer species, which is the predominant constituent in adult mouse brain.

The m/z value at 812 in S1 and at 810 in S2 corresponded to GlcCer and GlcCer, respectively.
