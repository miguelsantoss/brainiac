Background: While most patients with mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) transition to Alzheimer disease (AD),
others develop non-AD dementia, remain in the MCI state,
or improve.
Objective: To test the following hypotheses: smaller hip-

pocampal volumes predict conversion of MCI to AD,
whereas larger hippocampal volumes predict cognitive
stability and/or improvement; and patients with MCI who
convert to AD have greater atrophy in the CA1 hippocampal subfield and subiculum.
Design: Prospective longitudinal cohort study.
Setting: University of California–Los Angeles Alzhei-

mer’s Disease Research Center.
Patients: We followed up 20 MCI subjects clinically and
neuropsychologically for 3 years.

AD (MCI-c), 7 remained stable (MCI-nc), and 7
improved (MCI-i). Patients with MCI-c had 9% smaller
left and 13% smaller right mean hippocampal volumes
compared with MCI-nc patients. Radial atrophy maps
showed greater atrophy of the CA1 subregion in MCI-c.
Patients with MCI-c had significantly smaller hippocampi than MCI-i patients (left, 24%; right, 27%). Volumetric analyses showed a trend for greater hippocampal
atrophy in MCI-nc relative to MCI-i patients (eg, 16%
volume loss). After permutation tests corrected for multiple comparison, the atrophy maps showed a significant
difference on the right. Subicular differences were seen
between MCI-c and MCI-i patients, and MCI-nc and
MCI-i patients. Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed the group effect to be highly significant and independent of age, hemisphere, and Mini-Mental State
Examination scores at baseline.

Main Outcome Measure: Baseline regional hippocampal atrophy was analyzed with region-of-interest and
3-dimensional hippocampal mapping techniques.

Conclusions: Smaller hippocampi and specifically CA1
and subicular involvement are associated with increased risk for conversion from MCI to AD. Patients with
MCI-i tend to have larger hippocampal volumes and relative preservation of both the subiculum and CA1.

Results: During the 3-year study, 6 patients developed

transition to Alzheimer disease (AD), dementia with Lewy bodies, or vascular dementia, but some remain stable and others
improve.3 Reversible MCI may be due to depression, adverse effects of medication, hormonal changes, or nonneurological conditions severe enough to affect cognition.4 Any
improvement in our ability to predict the
outcome of MCI would be invaluable for
counseling patients, making therapeutic decisions, and planning clinical trials.5

Most amnestic MCI patients have AD
pathology.6,7 In AD the pathology typically appears first in the entorhinal cortex, followed by the hippocampus and later
the neocortex. Hippocampal atrophy correlates strongly with Braak and Braak
pathological staging8,9 and cognitive decline,8,10,11 and predates conversion to MCI
in the oldest old (Ն85 years).12
The MCI outcomes correlate with annualized hippocampal atrophy rates. The
annual atrophy rates for those who remain stable (MCI-nc) is 2.8% and for those
who develop AD (MCI-c) is 3.7%. The latter is strikingly similar to the 3.5% to 4.0%
observed in AD.13,14 Some researchers have
found an association between smaller hippocampi and the observed annual conversion rate from MCI to AD,15,16 whereas oth-

criteria: age 55 to 90 years, cognitive complaint, memory decline of at least 1.5 SD below the age- and education-adjusted neuropsychological norms on at least 1 memory test (California Verbal Learning Test, second edition; Wechsler Memory Scale, third
edition, logical memory and visual reproduction subtests; and ReyOsterrieth Complex Figure delayed recall test), intact activities
of daily living, no evidence of concurrent medical condition of
sufficient severity to have an impact on cognition, no history of
drug or alcohol abuse, and no concurrent psychiatric or other neurological illness. Patients underwent evaluation for depression with
the Geriatric Depression Scale. Those who were clinically depressed (Geriatric Depression Scale score, Ͼ10), who had conditions precluding safe performance of magnetic resonance imaging, or who had baseline images acquired more than 6 months
from the date of neuropsychological evaluation were excluded.

Three primary outcomes were defined: conversion to AD (MCI-c)
according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, forth edition30 and the National Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke–Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria; cognitive
improvement where patients no longer met criteria for MCI (MCIi); and cognitive stability where they remained in the MCI category during the 3 years of follow-up (MCI-nc). Diagnosis was
determined by consensus decision among neurologists, psychiatrists, and neuropsychologists who reviewed all available clinical and neuropsychological information.

heterogeneity, and variability in hippocampal volume may
partly explain these conflicting results.
We analyzed hippocampal atrophy in MCI with a region-of-interest technique and a new hippocampal 3-dimensional (3-D) radial atrophy mapping approach21 assessing for subregional structural deformations. The
technique has proved sensitive and reliable in several neurodegenerative,21-23 developmental,24,25 and psychiatric26,27 disorders, as well as in normal brain development28 and temporal lobe epilepsy.29
METHODS

PATIENTS
All subjects were prospectively recruited at the University of California–Los Angeles Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center according to the restrictions and policies of the university’s institutional review board. We prospectively followed 20 amnestic MCI
subjects prospectively for 3 years with detailed clinical and neu-

Imaging data were collected on a 1.5-T Signa magnetic resonance imaging scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wis)
with the following protocol: 3-D spoiled gradient coronal acquisition perpendicular to the long axis of the hippocampus, repetition time, 28 milliseconds; echo time, 6 milliseconds; field of
view, 220 mm; 256ϫ192 matrix; and slice thickness, 1.5 mm.
Magnetic resonance images were scaled to match the ICBM53 (International Consortium for Brain Mapping) average brain imaging template using a 9-parameter linear transformation.31 Image
nonuniformities due to magnetic field inhomogeneities were eliminated.32 Hippocampi were traced on contiguous coronal slices following a detailed, well-established protocol with high intrarater
and interrater reliability.33 When boundaries were ambiguous, a
standard neuroanatomical atlas was consulted.34 Tracings included the hippocampus proper, dentate gyrus, and subiculum.
All traces were made in a blinded fashion with respect to the subjects’ age, sex, and cognitive outcome. Region-of-interest volumetric data were extracted and analyzed statistically.
The hippocampal contours were split into top and bottom
components and transformed into 3-D parametric surface mesh
models with normalized spatial frequency of the surface points
within and across brain slices. This step ensures precise comparison of anatomy between subjects and groups at each hippocampal surface point. For each outcome group, we performed group averaging of hippocampal representations and
recorded the variation between corresponding surface points.
A medial core (central line threading down the long axis of the
hippocampus) was computed for each hippocampus. Hippocampal radial distance measures (ie, the distance from the medial core to each point on the hippocampal surface model) were
estimated. These values were used to generate individual distance maps that were combined across subjects to produce group
average distance maps for comparing surface morphology between the groups.21 Figure 1 summarizes these methods. The

STATISTICAL ANALYSES
The region-of-interest volumetric data were globally assessed
for group effects using analysis of variance. Each group pair
was first compared using the 2-sample t test with pooled variances, followed by a Tukey test correcting for multiple comparisons. Multiple linear regression analyses were performed
controlling for group, age, and Mini-Mental State Examination
score at baseline. The radial atrophy significance maps were
subjected to permutation-based statistics using a threshold of
PϽ.01 to ensure that the overall pattern of effects in the
surface-based maps could not have been observed by chance
alone.21
RESULTS

PRIMARY OUTCOME
Of the 20 MCI patients, 6 converted to AD (MCI-c), 7
remained stable (MCI-nc), and 7 improved (MCI-i).
Demographic data are shown in Table 1. The follow-up Mini-Mental State Examination score after 3 years
was significantly lower in MCI-c relative to MCI-i patients. The change in Mini-Mental State Examination
score, over the 3-year follow-up interval, did not show a

significant correlation with hippocampal volumes assessed at baseline (left side, r =−0.26, P=.26; right side,
r=−0.33, P=.15). These results did not change after stratification by MCI subgroup.
REGION-OF-INTEREST VOLUMETRIC ANALYSES
We found a significant group effect for the hippocampal
volumes in our MCI cohort using analysis of variance (left
side, R2 =42%, F=6.06, P=.01; right side, R2 =45%, F=4.6,
P =.006). A multiple linear regression model with hippocampal volume as the dependent variable and age,
group, and Mini-Mental State Examination score at baseline as the predictor variables was significant bilaterally
(left side, F=6.05, P=.006; right side, F=4.61, P=.02). Of
these predictors, only group membership was significantly associated with hippocampal volume (left side,
t=4.06, PϽ.001; right side, t=3.49, P=.003).
Two-sample t-test statistics with pooled variance
showed significant differences between MCI-c and MCI-nc
patients in the left hippocampal volume and a trend for
significance on the right. Significant bilateral differences were found between MCI-c and MCI-i patients. After correction for multiple comparisons, the MCI-c vs
MCI-i volume differences remained significant, whereas
the MCI-nc vs MCI-i differences showed a trend for significance (Table 2).

COMMENT

MCI-c showed a distinct pattern of hippocampal atrophy from MCI-nc and MCI-i. The magnetic resonance
imaging preconversion difference at baseline is atrophy
of the lateral edge of the hippocampal formation, possibly corresponding to the CA1 subfield. The baseline magnetic resonance imaging preconversion difference is atrophy of the lateral edge of the hippocampal formation,
possibly corresponding to the CA1 subfield. As we expected, the CA2 and CA3 subfields did not show differences between the 3 groups, although a larger sample may
be needed to detect subtle differences. The CA1 hippocampal subfield is particularly susceptible to neuronal
loss in early AD.36-38 One recent study demonstrated preferential CAI and subicular atrophy, and relative sparing
(REPRINTED) ARCH NEUROL / VOL 63, MAY 2006
697

of CA2, CA3, and CA4 subfields in the earliest pathologic AD stages (Braak states I-III).39
Using a computational anatomy approach similar to
ours, Wang et al40 and Csernansky et al41 compared hippocampal volume and shape between subjects with
mild AD (Clinical Dementia Rating Scale score, 0.5)
and age-matched control subjects. Their hippocampal
deformation maps accurately distinguished subjects
with AD from healthy controls. The AD group had
lateral-edge atrophy in regions corresponding to the
CA1 hippocampal subfield at baseline with spread to
the hippocampal head at follow-up. Further extending
their work, we found greater CA1 involvement in MCI
patients who later developed AD. We found strong correlations between greater atrophy and verbal memory
performance.
Some studies find that a proportion of MCI subjects
revert back to normal cognition when followed up longitudinally.3 To our knowledge, ours is the first imaging
study that includes the whole spectrum of clinical outcomes of cognitive worsening, improvement, and stability. Patients with reversible MCI seem to have CA1 and
subicular sparing and larger hippocampal volumes at baseline. The precise etiology for the amnestic syndrome in
our MCI-i patients remains obscure as we excluded patients with depression or any other illness that could contribute to cognitive decline. Future studies focusing on
MCI-i will help clarify its etiology.

Our study has several limitations. Despite the small
sample size, we were able to demonstrate significant morphological differences between the groups. A larger MCI
patient sample will better define hippocampal regions that
correlate best with cognitive outcomes and determine the
specificity and sensitivity of our methods in predicting cognitive outcome in patients with newly diagnosed MCI. Without direct pathological validation, the interpretation of the
subregional involvement remains arbitrary. The subregional boundaries we used are similar to those proposed
by other research groups.42,43 Nevertheless, what we interpret as CA1 or subicular involvement may reflect changes
in another hippocampal subregion. Our study focused on
amnestic MCI. Our findings cannot be generalized to all
MCI patients, especially to those with the nonamnestic subtype. A large prospective study that follows up patients with
all MCI subtypes over time is needed to address the etiological, clinical, and prognostic questions that remain unanswered.

Announcement
Trial Registration Required. In concert with the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE),
Archives of Neurology will require, as a condition of consideration for publication, registration of all trials in a public trials registry (such as http://ClinicalTrials.gov). Trials
must be registered at or before the onset of patient enrollment. This policy applies to any clinical trial starting enrollment after July 1, 2005. For trials that began
enrollment before this date, registration will be required by September 13, 2005, before considering the
trial for publication. The trial registration number should
be supplied at the time of submission.
For details about this new policy, and for information
on how the ICMJE defines a clinical trial, see the editorial by DeAngelis et al in the January issue of Archives of
Dermatology (2005;141:76-77). Also see the Instructions
to Authors on our Web site: www.archneurol.com.

Correction
Error in Text and Figures. In the Original Contribution by Apostolova et al titled “Conversion of Mild Cognitive Impairment to Alzheimer Disease Predicted by Hippocampal Atrophy Maps,” published in the May 2006 issue of the Archives (2006;
63(5):693-699), errors occurred in the text and in Figures 2 and 3 on pages 694, 696, and 697, respectively. In the
“Methods” subsection entitled “Imaging Data Acquisition and Analysis,” the first sentence should have read as follows:
“Imaging data were collected on a 1.5-T Signa magnetic resonance imaging scanner (GE Medical Systems, Milwaukee, Wis)
