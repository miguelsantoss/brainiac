A B S T R A C T : B a c k g r o u n d : The pathophysiology
of pain in Parkinson’s disease (PD) is still poorly understood, although it is conceivable that supraspinal mechanisms may be responsible for pain generation and
maintenance.
M e t h o d s : We examined brain functional and anatomical changes associated with persistent pain in 40 PD
patients, 20 with persistent pain and 20 without pain.
We also examined 15 pain-free healthy participants of
similar age, gender, and cognitive state as a control
group. We assessed pain by the King’s Parkinson’s
Pain Scale, the Visual Analogue Scale for pain, and the
Leeds Assessment for Neuropathic Symptoms and
Sign. All patients underwent structural, diffusion tensor
imaging, and resting-state functional MRI. We compared clinical characteristics, whole-brain cortical thickness, subcortical volumes, diffusion tensor imaging
scalar measures, and functional connectivity by network
based statistics.
R e s u l t s : The group with PD and persistent pain
showed significant thinning in the bilateral temporal

Pain is one of the most common nonmotor symptoms
in Parkinson’s disease (PD) with a prevalence ranging
from 40% to 85%, heterogeneous clinical presentation,

and left-inferior parietal areas, pars orbicularis, and right
superior frontal, posterior cingulated, and precentral
cortex. There were no significant subcortical volume
and white matter differences between PD subgroups.
Functional MRI showed a decrease of brain activity in
the left frontal inferior orbital in PD patients with persistent pain, with greater activity bilaterally in the cerebellum and in the right inferior temporal areas. Only PD
patients with persistent pain showed an accumbens–
hippocampus disconnection without white matter and
subcortical alterations.
C o n c l u s i o n s : We showed that persistent pain in PD
is associated with supraspinal structural and functional
changes. We also highlighted the contribution of frontal,
prefrontal, and insular areas in nociceptive modulation

and a disabling impact on quality of life.1,2 Pain is
reported already at the onset of the disease,3 it negatively affects rehabilitation strategies, and increases relatives and caregivers’ burden.4 Nonetheless, it is often
underrecognized and undertreated.5,6
Pain can occur as a consequence of dystonic muscle
contraction at the end of levodopa effect, secondary to
comorbidities such as osteo-arthrosis or disk herniation,7 and as a result of peripheral neuropathy.4,7
Indeed, it is now evident that with advancing disease, a
significant number of patients present abnormal nociceptive processing, reporting a lower pain threshold
than healthy controls.8 Pain threshold may also be

variably modulated by levodopa treatment, regardless
of its aetiology.9 However, pain does not constantly
improve with dopaminergic therapy10 and may also
respond to other treatments, including deep brain stimulation,11 suggesting that other supraspinal mechanisms, not directly influenced by dopamine, are
involved in its modulation.
The experience of pain is associated with psychological and neurophysiological responses and is processed
by a broad neural network, which includes sensorydiscriminative, motivational-affective, and cognitive
areas.12,13 Specific brain alterations are found in
several persistent pain conditions with a different
pathophysiology, such as irritable bowel syndrome,
fibromyalgia, headache, or neuropathic pain. Regions
found consistently involved are somatosensory areas,
the insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), prefrontal
cortex (PFC), thalamus (Th), and periaqueductal gray
matter.14 Some (PFC, Th Insula, ACC, and hippocampus) are also linked to the pars compacta of substantia
nigra (SNpc), providing the neural bases for a PDspecific network involvement in pain processing.15-17
However, to date there are no studies investigating
whether pain in PD is associated with structural alteration, whereas functional imaging has confirmed the
role of the insula and ACC as well as prefrontal and
somatosensory cortices.10,18
Nonetheless, the exact mechanisms of nociceptive
processing and modulation in PD remain unclear.19 In
this study, we assessed both structural and functional
cerebral changes associated with persistent pain in PD
patients. Persistent pain was assessed using the King’s
PD pain scale that has been specifically developed for
the assessment of PD pain and recently applied in clinical trials.20,21

stimulation); severe psychosis or psychological diseases, which may hinder perception or self-reporting
of pain; peripheral neuropathy as a result of comorbidities, such as Herpes zoster or posttraumatic neuropathies; and diffuse vascular lesions on MRI scan
(as seen on FLuid Attenuated Inversion Recovery(FLAIR)). A total of 25 age-matched and pain-free
healthy controls (HC) were also included and underwent the same clinical and neuroimaging assessment
protocols.
The pain subscales of the 36-item Short Form(SF36) Health Survey25 (items 21 and 22) were used to
define a clear division between the PD-Pain group and
the PD-Ctrl group. Patients were enrolled in the PDPain group if they reported severe or very severe pain
(item 21) or to have pain interfering with everyday
activities quite a bit or extremely (item 22). In the PDPain group, we only enrolled patients who had (1)
persistent pain for more than 3 months and (2) pain
experienced on a recurrent or daily basis (item 2 of
King’s Parkinson’s Disease Pain Scale [KPP] > 2).20,21
PD patients and healthy participants declaring no pain
or very little pain that did not interfere with normal
activities were included in the PD-Ctrl and HC
groups, respectively. We decided to use both the SF-36
and KPP scales to better characterize pain symptoms.
The 2 scales together can assess pain intensity, frequency, and its impact on daily activities. Moreover,
the KPP has also been used in recent clinical trials to
test the effect of pain medications.20
This study was approved by the ethical committee
of the IRCCS San Camillo Hospital. Written informed
consent was obtained from each individual according
to the Declaration of Helsinki after an extensive explanation of the aim and experimental procedures of
the study (Protocol 2013.08).

Participants

Study Procedure

From February 2013 to May 2015, a total of 188
consecutive PD inpatients were examined at the Parkinson Disease Unit of IRCCS San Camillo Hospital,
in Venice, Italy. All patients underwent extensive clinical, neuropsychological, behavioral, and MRI evaluations. The patients’ inclusion criteria were a diagnosis
of idiopathic PD according to the UK Brain Bank criteria,22 an ability to understand study purposes and
procedures, and a willingness to participate in the
study. To maximize subjective feedback from selfreported questionnaires and take into account cognitive and psychological aspect that might influence
pain,17 a Mini-Mental State Examination score
(MMSE)23  24 and Beck Depression Index-II score
(BDI-II24 < 30 were considered inclusion criteria.
Exclusion criteria were the presence of previous
neurosurgical procedures (including deep brain

were stable during the entire assessment period, and
the scanning procedures were always set at the same
time of day in the medication ON-state to avoid
biases because of diurnal variations. The levodopa
equivalent dose (LEED)31 was calculated, and other
medications were noted.

To comprehensively evaluate the pain of the PD and
healthy participants, we used the following 3 tools:
the KPP scale,20,21 a Visual Analogue Scale (VAS),32
and Leeds Assessment of Neuropathic Symptoms and
Signs (LANSS).33 The KPP scale is a validated comprehensive questionnaire and was chosen for its ability to
discriminate different types of pain and evaluate its
intensity and daily frequency.26 The scale has 7 domains investigating musculoskeletal, chronic, visceral,
nocturnal, motor fluctuation–related, radicular, and
oro-facial pain during the last month. One or more
items address every domain. Higher scores are associated with more frequent or more intense pain.21 The
LANSS scale was developed to discriminate whether
pain had predominantly neuropathic features, and it
includes 7 items investigating different symptoms such
as burning pain, electroshock-like pain, pins and needles sensations, and hyperalgesia. Scores can range
from 0 to 24, and a score of 12 or higher indicates
that pain is likely to have a neuropathic origin.33
Secondary outcomes assessed functional and motor
severity of Parkinson’s disease (UPDRS part-II, III and
H&Y) and psychological (BDI-II, STAI-Y1, and STAIY2) and cognitive characteristics (MMSE). Data relative to secondary outcomes and their validity and
accuracy can be found in previous studies.26,27

MRI Acquisition
Patients underwent structural diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and functional resting state MRI with a
1.5 T Achieva Philips scanner (Philips Medical Systems, Best, The Netherlands) with an 8-channel head
coil. MRI protocol included (1) a whole-head 3dimensional sagittal T1-weighted-3D-TFE (repletion
time [TR] 5 8.3 milliseconds, echo time [TE] 5 4.1
milliseconds, flip angle 5 88, matrix resolution
[mr] 5 288 3 288, slice thickness [ST] 5 0.87 mm), (2)
echo-planar imaging sequence (TR 5 1929.2 milliseconds, TE 5 45 milliseconds, slices 5 25, ST 5 5.2 mm,
acquired voxel size [mm] 5 2.875 3 2.875; mr 5
80 3 80; FA 5 908, SENSE-factor 5 2, volumes 5 240),
and (3) Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI) sequence
(TR 5 11067.3 milliseconds, TE 5 80.3 milliseconds,
slices 5 67, ST 5 2 mm, acquired voxel size [mm] 5 2,
mr 5 128 3 128, flip angle 5 908, SENSitivity
Encoding(SENSE)-factor 5 2, volumes 5 33, diffusion
direction 5 32; diffusion B-value 5 800, number of
acquisitions 5 3).
Participant’s heads were accurately immobilized
with pillows to minimize head movement artifacts.
During data acquisition, participants were instructed
to lie quietly in the scanner, close their eyes, and
remain awake. The echo-planar imaging field of view
was set parallel to the intercommissural line to guarantee a whole-brain analysis. MRI scans with cerebral

white matter (WM) hypo intensity in T1, evidence of
space-occupying lesions, and head motion artefacts
were excluded.

Cortical Thickness and Subcortical
Volume Analysis
Gray matter (GM) changes within PD groups were
analyzed comparing cortical thickness.34 Cortical
thickness and subcortical volumes were obtained with
FreeSurfer-5.3 Software35 that computes the curvature
of the GM and WM interfaces to characterize sulci
and gyri and inflates the whole brain into a sphere for
the purpose of surface-based nonrigid registering of
participants according to the Talairach standard
atlas.35,36 The human cortex is then divided into 34
regions of interest in each hemisphere36 and in subcortical WM and GM volumetric structures (including
the hippocampus, amygdala, caudate, putamen, accumbens, and ventricles).35

Tract-Based Spatial Statistical Analysis
WM microstructural brain tissue integrity was
assessed using DTI measures of fractional anisotropy
(fractional anysotropy (FA); unspecific microstructural
alteration), mean diffusivity (MD; cellular membrane
or cellular density alteration), and radial diffusivity
(demyelination).37 Native data were processed using
the dt_recon Freesurfer tool. Preprocessing steps
included dual-step registration to standard Montreal
Neurologic Institute(MNI) space and selection of WM
tracts less affected from between-subjects’ variability
by means of skeletonization Functional MRI of
the Brain(FMRIB)-Software-Library(FSL)’s procedure
(http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/). See the supplementary material for further details.

Resting State Analysis
To analyze if persistent pain is associated with
abnormalities in regional neuronal spontaneous activity, we compared MRI-based fractional amplitude of
low frequency fluctuations (fALFF)38 between the PDPain and PD-Ctrl groups. fMRI data preprocessing
was run using the dpabi-Resting-State fMRI Data
Analysis Toolkit (4.0 version, http://rfmri.org/dpabi)39
and included (1) slice timing, (2) spatial realignment,
(3) nuisance covariates regression, (4) temporal band
pass filtering (0.01Hz-0.073 Hz), (5) ALFF and fALFF
calculation, and (6) 2-step normalization to the MNI
template. See the supplementary materials for details.

between the pain networks’ ROIs was compared using
a network-based statistical analysis (NBS).40 The resting state fMRI in the HC were as previously described
for PD patients. Based on recent literature,41 we chose
20 regions known to be associated with pain: left and
right sensory areas(S1 and S2), left and right insula,
supplementary motor regions, anterior and posterior
cingulate cortices, left and right thalamus, left and
right hippocampus, left and right amygdala, periaqueductal gray matter, left and right nucleus accumbens,
and left and right cerebellum areas. Thresholds were
set at 0.70 of probability and masked using a mean
GM mask previously obtained by Statistical
Parametric Mapping release8-Data Processing &
Analysis of Brain Imaging (SPM8-DPABI) segmentation of a sample T1-weighted-3D. Raw means were
extracted from each ROI using the dpabi tool and
then included in NBS using the GraphVar (0.62 version) tool (https://www.nitrc.org/projects/graphvar/).42
The preprocessing procedure of the fMRI correlation matrix included (1) band pass filtered raw signal
extraction from the ROIs, (2) correlation matrix generation, (3) values normalization, (4) generation of
permuted matrix, (5) T-based threshold, and (6) network model generation (see the supplementary materials for details). After preprocessing, network models
were considered for each participant if they reach an
explorative P < .1 and a node size > 3.

Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses included between-group comparisons of demographic and clinical variables of PD-Pain
versus PD-Ctrl groups. Continuous and dichotomous
variables were compared among groups running nonparametric Mann–Whitney U and chi-squared tests.
Pearson correlations were used to analyze the degree
of association between clinical, demographic, and neuropsychologic variables. All statistics were performed
using SPSS version 20 (IBM SPSS, Chicago, Illinois).
Between-group differences for the cerebral GM
thickness and subcortical volumes were assessed by
general linear model (GLM) surface-based analysis.
Statistical maps were generated using Freesurfer’s
QDEC 1.4 (Query, Design, Estimate, Contrast) application. QDEC fits a GLM at each surface vertex to
explain the data from all participants in the study.
The results were obtained with a full-width/half max
of 15 mm. Age, disease duration, LEED, and intracranial volume were used as covariates for each group.
We applied Monte Carlo nonparametric testing, correcting for multiple comparisons across space for cerebral thickness. For the cortical thickness analysis, a
P < .05 clusterwise Monte Carlo corrected threshold
was used, and a P < .005 uncorrected threshold was
used only for exploratory purposes. A P < .05 Sidak

correction for multiple comparisons across areas was
adopted for subcortical volumes.
For DTI, we used the FSL tool Tract-Based Spatial
Statistics(TBSS)43 to compare diffusion measures
between PD patients’ subgroups, including age, disease
duration, LEED, and intracranial volume in the model, as covariates for each group separately. In addition,
fALFF GLM comparisons were performed voxel by
voxel between PD subgroups with the FSL randomize
tool.39 Statistical results for the DTI and fALFF were
corrected for multiple comparisons using the FSL randomize tool, with 5000 permutations, and the randomize option threshold-free cluster enhancement
(TFCE)43 was applied with threshold at P < .05. We
adopted a nonparametric permutation-based FamilyWise Error (FWE) multiple correction. This approach
has been indicated as adequate to minimize false positive findings.44
Finally, nonparametric analysis of variance was run
among suprathreshold connections in the PD-Pain,
PD-Ctrl, and pain-free HC groups to rule out possible
brain alterations specific to PD but not related to
pain. The F test for multiple comparisons was performed at the P < .05 level of significance.

Results
Demographic and Clinical Features
of Participants
A total of 40 PD patients (28 men and 12 women)
and 15 pain-free HC (12 men and 3 women) fulfilled
the selection criteria and were enrolled in the study.
Mean patient age was 66.64 (standard deviation [SD]
10.07), and disease duration was 10.49 years (SD
5.02). Of the PD patients, 20 (11 men and 9 women)
were included in the PD-Pain group, and 20 patients
(17 men and 3 women) were classified as PD-Ctrl.
Mean HC age was 61 (SD 8.30), MMSE > 28, and
BDI was 8.00 (SD 8.98). Demographic and clinical
features of PD patients are summarized in Table 1.
The PD subgroups were similar in age, severity of
the disease (H&Y), motor severity (UPDRS III), and
motor aspects of experiences of daily living (UPDRS
II), with a trend for greater prevalence of women in
the cohort with pain. Cognitive and psychological
aspects (MMSE, BDI, STAI-Y1, and STAI-Y2) were
also similar in the 2 groups. PD-Pain patients had longer disease duration (P 5 .045), received less levodopa
therapy (P 5 .035), and presented greater pain scores
(P 5 .0001, P 5 .0004, and P 5 .004 for KPP, VAS,
and LANSS, respectively). The KPP global score
strongly correlated with the VAS and LANSS scores
(P < .0001). In addition, all 7 domains of the KPP
score were correlated (P < .05). All PD-Pain patients
scored musculoskeletal, chronic, and visceral pain
domains, and in at least 2 other domains of the scale

(oro-facial domain > 0 in 45% and edema/swelling
domain > 0 in 60% of the PD-Pain subgroup). By contrast, no persistent or frequent pain symptoms were
reported in the PD-Ctrl group. Of the PD-Ctrl
patients, 13 were completely pain free, and the others
reported only low intensity scores in fewer than 3 subitems (eg, mild score related to physical exercise or
digestive functions).
Disease duration positively correlated with King’s
PD-Pain score (P < .017). Age negatively correlated
with the edema/swelling domain of King’s PD-Pain
score (P 5 .033). There was no correlation between
pain scores and disease severity (H&Y, UPDRS-III),
functional impairment (UPDRS-II), LEED, psychological status, or cognitive performances global score in
any pain assessment measure.
A total of 6 patients in the PD-Ctrl group and 3
patients in the PD-Pain group were on benzodiazepines or antidepressants. In both groups there were
patients on additional medications, such as cardioaspirin or melatonin. All patients in the PD-Pain group

were on analgesic medication (16 in monotherapy,
mainly paracetamol and 4 in association with codeine
or oxycodone). Only 3 of 20 patients in the PD-Ctrl
group occasionally take paracetamol.

Cortical and Subcortical Pattern Associated
With Pain in Parkinson’s Patients
The PD-Pain patients showed significant thinning
(P < .05 Monte Carlo corrected) in the right superior
frontal gyrus, namely, the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), when compared with the PD without
pain participants. Moreover, widespread cortical thinning (uncorrected P < .005 threshold) was also found
in the temporal pole bilaterally, left pars opercularis,
superior parietal, postcentral, medial orbitofrontal cortex, and in parts of the superior temporal sulcus. In
the right hemisphere, significant thinning was found in
posterior insular cortex (pIC), lateral occipital cortex,
posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), supramarginal area,
and superior temporal gyrus (see Table 2, Fig. 1A).

Changes in Regional Spontaneous
Brain Activity Associated With Pain in
Parkinson’s Patients
A total of 2 patients in each PD group had acquisition
artifacts during fMRI (relative movement > 1.5 mm)
and were excluded from analysis. PD-Pain patients
showed a reduction of fALFF in the frontal inferior
orbital of the left hemisphere (Table 3, Fig. 1B). On the
contrary, greater fALFF activity was found bilaterally in
the cerebellum area and in the temporal inferior areas
of the right hemisphere.

ROI-Based Network Comparison in
Parkinson’s Patients and HC
The F test analysis showed a significant difference
between the HC, PD-Ctrl, and PD-Pain groups in the
right Nucleus Accumbens (NAc)–left hippocampus
connection. After post hoc comparisons, we found
that this disconnection between the NAc and left hippocampus was determined solely by the PD-Pain
cohort (T 5 3.54, P < .05 corrected; see Fig. 2).

Discussion
We investigated functional and structural brain correlates of persistent pain in PD using both an exhaustive clinical evaluation and neuroimaging techniques.
This is the first report linking a comprehensive clinical
assessment of persistent pain with anatomical and
functional neuroimaging.
Our data indicate that persistent pain in PD is associated with relative thinning in several brain areas—
DLPFC, Orbito-Frontal Cortex (OFC), posterior Insular Cortex (pIC), and PCC—and with local functional
alterations in the OFC and cerebellum. Most structural alterations in the DLPFC, OFC, and pIC have been
reported in other chronic pain conditions.14
DLPFC is part of the mesocortical system and
receives dopamine projections from both the SN pars
compacta and the ventral tegmental area (VTA).15 It
is a key area in the descending pain modulatory system,45 consistent with its role in expectation, reward,
and decision making.46 The OFC is also well connected with the striatum and dopaminergic nuclei, and
it is involved in expectation and rewards.47 The OFC
increases its activity to link several stimuli with their
subjective emotional and affective value47 or during
pain inhibition.48 Posterior IC is considered a central
area for sensory integration, receiving significant inputs from nociceptive and nonnociceptive fibers.49 It
forms the main sensory area for inputs from the spinothalamic pathway.49 pIC is also highly connected with
primary and secondary sensory areas in the parietal
lobe that are important during sensory-discriminative
processing of inputs, including nociception.50 Insular
Cortex (IC) is considered a central area for nonmotor
symptoms of PD patients. Christopher and

colleagues51 showed that the cortical thickness of the
IC is not related to patients’ cognitive status. Taken
together, our data confirm the relevance that the prefrontal insular cortex covers in pain conditions.
On the contrary, to the best of our knowledge, the
PCC is not associated with pain generation,52
although it may be activated during noxious stimulation,52 suggesting a role in the emotional evaluation of
stimuli. PCC atrophy was found in AD, but its role in
cognitive decline in PD is controversial.53,54 Our data

showed structural alterations of PCC associated with
pain and not with cognitive or psychological features.
Despite its unclear function, the PCC is well connected
to the PFC and may link DLPFC and OFC and other
cortical regions, possibly in association with the emotional evaluation that pain requires.55
Other very interesting results come from the functional MRI evaluation. NBS analysis was based on
several ROIs chosen a priori and showed that a specific disconnection between the right NAc and the left

hippocampus—within the aforementioned network—
might cover a central role in persistent PD pain. NAc
receives modulatory inputs by the hippocampus and
VTA.56 NAc has recently emerged as a key structure
in chronic and neuropathic pain. Both animal and
human studies pointed out its role in the transition
from subacute to chronic and neuropathic pain.57,58 In
our study, patients in the PD-Pain group had both
chronic pain and neuropathic features, and the alteration of reward feedback because of reduced NAc-tohippocampus interaction is consistent with the clinical
presentation.
Other functional MRI studies used fALFF to present
local alterations in the OFC, temporal areas, and cerebellar circuits in PD-Pain patients.59 Our data demonstrate that OFC covers a major role in PD pain,
showing both structural and functional alterations.
The cerebellum receives projection from the basal ganglia and VTA and sends projections to a widespread
network, including the frontal (eg, DLPFC), motor,
somatosensory, and parietal regions.60 Emerging evidence indicates that the cerebellum in PD presents specific structural changes and may be related to
nonmotor manifestations.61 Our results are also consistent with evidence demonstrating the functional
alteration of the right cerebellum and parietal regions
in the early onset of PD.59 The role of the lingual cortex and temporal areas in pain is less established.
They both have been classically ascribed to memory,
word processing, and visual function. Lingual gyrus
atrophy has been related to visual hallucination in
PD,62 and temporal pole hypotrophy to cognitive
decline.63
Our clinical assessments were comprehensive, and
PD groups with and without pain were well comparable in demographic, cognitive, psychological, and
motor aspects, except for total LEDD, which was
modestly lower in the PD-Pain patients possibly
because of the greater prevalence of women. Clinical
results are consistent with other neuroimaging evaluations. We found no differences in WM or in the subcortical regions typically related to PD’s motor and
cognitive impairment.64 We are confident the presented results express persistent pain and lingual and
temporal pole fALFF alterations that might therefore
be related to additional nonmotor features, which may
be addressed by future studies. Of note, fMRI is highly variable within subjects, and it may change under
different conditions (eg, in ON and OFF phases). We
carefully assessed all patients in the ON state to
explain only those functional alterations that are
dependent on persistent pain and not related to motor
fluctuations.
We explored persistent pain with the KPP scale, the
first specifically developed and validated for PD.5,21
We acknowledge that our sample size was not very

large, but the prevalence of patients with persistent
pain without any previous peripheral cause that satisfied our criteria was relatively small. Indeed, our
cohort was identified after screening 188 patients, and
the participants were carefully evaluated before inclusion. Our data showed strong correlations across the
domains of KPP, suggesting that common mechanisms
may be responsible for the persistence of various pain
manifestations. All PD-Pain patients reported positive
scores in at least 5 domains of King’s PD-Pain scale,
confirming other published data that have showed a
high prevalence and variability of pain in PD.4
In conclusion, we highlighted for the first time a network of brain regional alterations specifically associated to persistent pain in PD and not present in painfree patients with similar cognitive, psychological, and
clinical profiles. We propose that the present network
is involved in pain processing regardless of its primary
manifestation. Pain in PD is associated with distinct
regional alterations in dopaminergic areas such as the
OFC—which presents both functional and structural
changes—and PFC. Other nondopaminergic areas
such as the pIC, PCC, parietal regions, and cerebellum
also showed structural and functional changes that
might be related to sensory-motor and emotional
responses to pain.
Further longitudinal studies are needed to improve
our understanding of the supraspinal mechanisms of
pain in PD. Our data strongly recommend that future
research considers and controls for pain symptoms, as
they are associated with important structural and
functional cerebral changes.
