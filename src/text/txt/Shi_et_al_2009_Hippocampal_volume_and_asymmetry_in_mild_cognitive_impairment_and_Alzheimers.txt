Hippocampal Volume and Asymmetry in Mild Cognitive Impairment
and Alzheimer’s Disease: Meta-Analyses of MRI Studies
Feng Shi,1 Bing Liu,1 Yuan Zhou,1 Chunshui Yu,2 and Tianzi Jiang1*

ABSTRACT:
Numerous studies have reported a smaller hippocampal
volume in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients than in aging controls.
However, in mild cognitive impairment (MCI), the results are inconsistent. Moreover, the left-right asymmetry of the hippocampus receives
less research attention. In this article, meta-analyses are designed to
determine the extent of hippocampal atrophy in MCI and AD, and to
evaluate the asymmetry pattern of the hippocampal volume in control,
MCI, and AD groups. From 14 studies including 365 MCI patients and
382 controls, signiﬁcant atrophy is found in both the left [Effect size
(ES), 0.92; 95% conﬁdence interval (CI), 0.72–1.11] and right (ES, 0.78;
95% CI, 0.57–0.98) hippocampus, which is lower than that in AD (ES,
1.60, 95% CI, 1.37–1.84, in left; ES, 1.52, 95% CI, 1.31–1.72, in right).
Comparing with aging controls, the average volume reduction weighted
by sample size is 12.9% and 11.1% in left and right hippocampus in
MCI, and 24.2% and 23.1% in left and right hippocampus in AD,
respectively. The ﬁndings show a bilateral hippocampal volume loss in
MCI and the extent of atrophy is less than that in AD. By comparing the
left and right hippocampal volume, a consistent left-less-than-right
asymmetry pattern is found, but with different extents in control (ES,
0.39), MCI (ES, 0.56), and AD (ES, 0.30) group. V 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

INTRODUCTION
Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by neuroﬁbrillary tangles (NFTs) and
amyloid deposition (Terry et al., 1991; Nestor et al., 2004). The spread
of NFTs is hierarchized, starting from the medial temporal lobe structures including the hippocampus, followed by the association areas, and
ﬁnally extending to the entire cortex (Delacourte et al., 1999). These
microscopic changes will inﬂuence global structures, which can be
assessed with volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Mortimer

et al., 2004). In AD patients, numerous neuroimaging
studies reported structural brain abnormalities, and
hippocampal atrophy was taken as a consistent ﬁnding
(Chetelat and Baron, 2003). Hippocampal volume
and its change were proven to be effective in predicting disease progression and AD diagnosis (Mungas
et al., 2002; Anstey and Maller, 2003; den Heijer
et al., 2006).
As a better representation of the clinical manifestation of incipient AD, the criteria of mild cognitive
impairment (MCI) was developed by Petersen in
1999 (Petersen et al., 1999). The rate of developing
AD in MCI is 10–15% per year, much higher than
that in normal elderly subjects, which is about 1–2%
per year (Pennanen et al., 2004). Consequently, investigating the hippocampal volume atrophy in MCI and
the comparison of magnitude and extent of atrophy
between MCI and AD attract great interest recently,
because it has the potential to provide a measure for
tracking the disease progression and understand the
pathogenesis. In MCI, many studies reported bilateral
hippocampal atrophy (Wolf et al., 2001; Hsu et al.,
2002; Anstey and Maller, 2003; Wang et al., 2003;
Pennanen et al., 2004; Wolf et al., 2004; Jessen et al.,
2006). However, there were also some inconsistent
results. Muller et al. (2005) found signiﬁcant lower
volume only existed in the left hippocampus, and
Zhang et al. (2007) reported smaller hippocampal volume only on the right side. In several longitudinal
studies, total hippocampal volume was reported as
reduced in the following order: control > MCI >
AD (Pennanen et al., 2004; Jessen et al., 2006), and
the hippocampal volume in MCI converters to AD
was signiﬁcantly smaller than in MCI nonconverters
(Devanand et al., 2007). In general, there are many
previous studies that have investigated the hippocampal volume in MCI and AD patients, but studies on
the statistical analysis of the magnitude and extent of
hippocampal volumetric reduction are relatively rare,
and the ﬁndings are also affected by limited sample
size, especially in longitudinal studies.
To address this issue, we introduce the meta-analysis to determine the magnitude and extent of hippocampal volume in MCI and AD studies, by integrating the results of relevant cross-sectional studies and

overcoming the effect of small sample size in single study.
Meta-analysis is a well established statistic method and widely
used in brain and hippocampus volumetric studies on depression (Campbell et al., 2004b; Videbech and Ravnkilde, 2004),
Schizophrenia (Boos et al., 2007), Posttraumatic Stress Disorder
(PTSD) (Karl et al., 2006), etc. Instead of simply summarizing
the previous studies’ results, meta-analysis deﬁnes an effect size
to represent the quantitative ﬁndings in each study and allow
the comparisons across studies.
Meanwhile, increasing evidence indicates that pathological
factors may lead to asymmetry in brain (Toga and Thompson,
2003; Nardi and Bingman, 2007). Wolf et al. (2001) reported
signiﬁcant left-less-than-right hippocampal asymmetry in controls and MCI patients. Barnes et al. (2005) found a nonsigniﬁcant trend of left-less-than-right asymmetry in controls and
the ﬁrst scan of AD patients, but the asymmetry was not
remained in the follow-up scan at 15 months later. These studies indicate the asymmetry in the left and right hippocampal
volume exists and may varies with disease progression, and thus
additional meta-analyses on hippocampal asymmetry were
adopted to address this issue.
In this study, we conduct meta-analyses of the cross-sectional
MRI studies which contain a volumetric analysis of the hippocampus in MCI or AD patients. Our aims are: (a) to summarize the previous hippocampal volume studies in MCI and AD
patients and establish the extent of hippocampal atrophy; (b)
to examine the moderating variables that might contribute to
the discrepancies; and (c) to investigate the asymmetry patterns
of the hippocampus in controls, MCI, and AD patients.

METHODS

Considering the MRI techniques were developed rapidly and
the value of earlier volumetric studies with older imaging paradigms might be largely diminished, studies published before
the year 1998 were not included. Seventeen studies showed
their hippocampal volume results with only ﬁgures or provided
only the total hippocampal volume (left plus right). For these
studies, we contacted the authors to request the detailed data
via email. Five studies were remained in this manner (Head
et al., 2005; de Leon et al., 2006; Ridha et al., 2006; Wang
et al., 2006a; Zhang et al., 2007). If the same subjects were
used in different studies, only one study with the largest sample
was included (Laakso et al., 1998, 2000b). One study (Murphy
et al., 2003) reporting excessive hippocampal atrophy was discarded for highly bias in the following sensitive test. In the
remaining 28 studies, the minimum number of samples in
patient and control group was 6. No studies were excluded
based on the sample size but sample size correction was introduced by the following effect size deﬁnition.
If a study provided both raw volume (i.e., mm3) and normalized volume of hippocampus (Laakso et al., 1998; Wolf
et al., 2004; Muller et al., 2005; Yavuz et al., 2007), the latter
would be chosen. When multiscan data was provided in a longitudinal study (Dixon et al., 2002; Barnes et al., 2005; Ridha
et al., 2006), the ﬁrst scan was chosen. If more than one control group were provided, for example, a younger and an older
groups (Head et al., 2005), or nondemented cotwins and normal controls (Jarvenpaa et al., 2004), the one with better
matched age and the nondemented cotwins were chosen.
Finally, 28 studies were included in our meta-analysis (Fig. 1),
in which 23 studies included 700 AD patients and 751 controls (Laakso et al., 1998; de Toledo-Morrell et al., 2000;
Laakso et al., 2000a,b; Wolf et al., 2001; Dixon et al., 2002;
Hsu et al., 2002; Davies et al., 2004; Jarvenpaa et al., 2004;

Data Sources
The MEDLINE database was searched up to October 2007
using the following keywords: ‘‘Hippocampus’’ (as a Medical
Subject Heading [MeSH] term) and ‘‘Alzheimer disease’’ (as a
MeSH term) and ‘‘Volume.’’ The term ‘‘Alzheimer disease’’ was
then substituted with ‘‘Mild cognitive impairment’’ or ‘‘Dementia’’ (as a MeSH term), and the search was repeated. Titles
and abstracts were examined to decide whether studies could
be included, and the full article of candidates was checked to
further determination. Additional studies were identiﬁed from
the reference lists of key studies.

Study Selection
A total of 42 studies fulﬁlling the following criteria were
included: (1) hippocampal volume counting was based on MRI
volumetric data; (2) MCI or AD patients were involved;
(3) a population of normal controls was reported concurrently;
(4) they should be published in peer-review journal with English
language; and (5) they were published not before 1998.

AD and MCI) (Table 1).

Data Analysis
Data is analyzed using the RevMan 4.2.10 software supplied
by Cochrane Collaboration (http://www.cc-ims.net/RevMan).
For each study, effect size is calculated by Hedges g, which is
similar to the metric Cohen d (Cohen, 1988) but includes an
adjustment for small sample size bias (Hedges and Olkin,
1985). The formula is as follows:

ðn1i  1Þsd1i2 þ ðn2i  1Þsd2i2
si ¼
Ni  2

where in the ith study, x1i and x2i are the mean hippocampal
volume in the control group and patient group, respectively;
sd1i and sd2i are the standard derivation (SD); si is the pooled
standard deviation; n1i and n2i are the number of subjects of
two groups, respectively; and Ni is the number of total subjects
in the ith study (Ni 5 n1i 1 n2i).
Effect size (ES) can be interpreted in terms of the percent of
nonoverlap of score distributions of two groups. An ES of 0.0
indicate the distribution of volume for two groups are totally
overlapped. ES of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.8 indicate a nonoverlap rate
of 14.7, 33.0, and 47.4%, referring to small, medium, and
large effects respectively (Cohen, 1988). The higher ES value
is, the larger difference is found in two groups.
After computing the individual effect sizes, we use a random
effects model to weigh the studies by an inverse variance
method. In this way, we can obtain a combined effect size g,
which indicates the magnitude of the association across all
studies. The formulas are as follows:
P

g ¼ P

Ni
gi2
SEi ¼
þ
n1i n2i 2ðNi  3:94Þ
where gi is the effect size of the ith study, xi is the inverse variance weight, and SEi is the standard error.
Thus, the weighted combined effect size g and its 95% conﬁdence interval (CI) can be obtained. A larger effect size means
a greater difference in the hippocampal volume between the
two groups. If a 95% CI contains 0, it means that no signiﬁcant difference exists.
In addition, the homogeneity statistic, Q, is calculated to
assess the variance of results across studies as follows:
Q¼

X

xi ðgi  gÞ2

Q is distributed as x2(df 5 n0 21, n0 is the number of studies). A signiﬁcant Q statistic indicates that studies cannot share
a common population effect size (i.e., they are heterogenous).
In this case, further analysis is needed to investigate potential
moderating factors.
In the following asymmetry analysis, the left and right hippocampal volumes are compared, which are dependent groups
as called a correlated design (Rosnow and Rosenthal, 1996).
Hedges g is employed to calculate the effect size. There are
Hippocampus

some arguments on how to compute the pooled SD (Mullen
and Rosenthal, 1985; Rosenthal, 1991; Dunlop et al., 1996).
In this study, we choose the original standard deviations instead
of the paired t-test value, to avoid overestimating the actual
effect size (Dunlop et al., 1996).
Sensitivity analysis is conducted to ensure that no single
study will bias the combined results by removing one study
each time and recalculating the combined effect size of the
remaining studies. Usually, published studies tend to be biased
toward positive ﬁndings, and a nonsigniﬁcant ﬁnding may not
be published. This will cause the ﬁle drawer problem. Fail-safe
number is introduced to assess this publication bias. The failsafe number nfs signiﬁes the minimum number of unpublished
studies with nonsigniﬁcant ﬁndings that needed to overturn the
conclusion of the meta-analysis. A larger fail-safe number
means the results are safer from publication bias. Orwin has
provided a formula to calculate nfs as follows (Orwin, 1983):

nfs ¼

n0 ðjgj  gc Þ
gc

where n0 is the number of studies, and gc is the trivial value to
which the obtained effect would be reduced, here we set 0.20
as the criterion effect size.

Moderator Variables
Two factors may largely inﬂuence heterogeneity in this study,
namely head size correction methods and disease severities. In
many studies, hippocampus volume is provided directly as raw
volume. To account for variations in head size among subjects,
some studies normalize hippocampus volume to total intracranial volume (TIV), also known as intracranial volume (ICV),
deﬁned as the sum of the whole brain volume (WBV) and the
CSF volume. Some other studies also control hippocampus volume by coronal intracranial area (ICA) at the level of the anterior commissure. A subgroup analysis is performed to evaluate
the effect of the heterogeneity of raw volume and two head size
correction methods of the hippocampal volume in AD and
MCI analysis.
MMSE (Mini Mental State Examination) score is always
taken as indicator of disease severity and provided in MCI and
AD studies. In MCI studies, mean MMSE score of each study
ranged from 24 to 28.7 (Mean 26.7, SD 1.4), suggesting that
subjects might have similar cognitive level. But in AD studies,
it ranged from 17.4 to 25 (Mean 21.7, SD 1.9), suggesting
that both mild and moderate Alzheimer’s disease were included
in these studies. The heterogeneity of disease severity may confound the ﬁndings in Alzheimer’s disease. Thus, a subgroup
analysis is designed to address the effect of the severity heterogeneity on the hippocampal volume by dividing AD into two
groups. The studies whose mean MMSE score are larger than
22 were classiﬁed as mild AD group and others as moderate
AD group.

RESULTS
Hippocampal Volume in MCI
Sensitivity analysis was ﬁrst utilized and no outliers were
found in this study. A total of 14 studies which met the inclusion criteria were entered into meta-analysis, including 365
MCI patients and 382 matched aging controls (Table 1). The
Q test of heterogeneity was nonsigniﬁcant in both the left
(P 5 0.16) and right (P 5 0.08) hippocampus. The combined
effect size Hedges g revealed signiﬁcant hippocampal volume
loss: 0.92 (95% CI, 0.72–1.11) for the left hippocampus
(Fig. 2) and 0.78 (95% CI, 0.57–0.98) for the right hippocampus (Fig. 3). The large effects of g indicated severe bilateral
hippocampal atrophy in MCI, especially in left side.
Comparing with controls, the average volume reduction
(AVR) weighted by sample size can be obtained as follows
(Videbech and Ravnkilde, 2004):
P
AVR ¼

ððPi  Ci Þ=Ci 3 Ni Þ
P
Ni

where Pi and Ci are the hippocampal volume in patients and
controls; Ni is the total sample size in ith study. The average
volume reduction was 12.9% (SD 4.2%) in the left hippocampus and 11.1% (SD 5.6%) in the right hippocampus. The fail
safe numbers in this case were 50.4 in the left and 40.6 in the
right, which were large enough to provide convincing results.

Hippocampal Volume in AD
Sensitivity analysis was also performed and one study with
excessive hippocampal atrophy, which largely inﬂuenced the
combined results, was taken as an outlier (Murphy et al.,
2003). Meta-analysis was performed in the remaining 23 studies comprising 700 AD patients and 751 matched aging controls (Table 1). The Q test of heterogeneity was signiﬁcant in
the left (P < 0.001) and right (P < 0.001) hippocampus. Random effect model was chosen in the meta-analysis to calculate
the effect size to reduce the inﬂuence of heterogeneity. The statistical signiﬁcances were revealed by combined Hedges g: 1.60
(95% CI, 1.37–1.84) for the left hippocampus and 1.52 (95%
CI, 1.31–1.72) for the right hippocampus (Table 2). By conducting a two sample t-test for the effect size of each study in
MCI and AD meta-analyses for each hippocampus, severe bilateral hippocampal atrophy pattern was found in AD than that
in MCI (left, P 5 0.019; right, P 5 0.004). The average volume reduction was 24.2% (SD 7.8%) in the left hippocampus
and 23.2% (SD 7.7%) in the right hippocampus. Fail-safe
numbers in this case were 168 in the left and 158.4 in the
right, which were large enough to provide convincing results.

Heterogeneity Analysis
The results of subgroup analysis for head size correction
methods were shown in Table 2. In MCI studies, a heterogeneity trend was found in overall studies (P 5 0.16 in the left,
P 5 0.08 in the right). In subgroup analysis, mild heterogeneity was only found in right hippocampus of the TIV correction

group (P 5 0.04). But when one study (de Leon et al., 2006)
was excluded in sensitivity analysis, heterogeneity was reduced
to nonsigniﬁcant (P 5 0.21). In AD studies, signiﬁcant heterogeneity observed in overall studies was largely reduced in these
subgroups, and only remained in the raw volume group (P 5
0.04 in left, P 5 0.01 in right).
To investigate the inﬂuence of disease severity, subgroup
analysis of MMSE score was performed in AD studies (Table
3). Signiﬁcant bilateral hippocampal heterogeneity was reduced

in right), but remained in moderate AD (MMSE < 5 22)
group (P < 0.001 in left, P < 0.001 in right). The effect size
which showed the atrophy was smaller in mild AD group (1.33

in left, 1.32 in right) than in moderate AD group (1.78 in left,
1.67 in right), as usually expected.

Hippocampal Asymmetry in Controls,
MCI and AD
To compare the asymmetry of the left and right hippocampi,
meta-analyses were performed in the controls, MCI, and AD
patients, respectively.
In the controls, 29 studies were involved, including 915 subjects. Combined effect size was achieved as 0.39 (95% CI,
0.26–0.52; Left < Right). In MCI patients, 14 studies were
selected, including 365 subjects. Combined effect size was

obtained as 0.56 (95% CI, 0.36–0.76; Left < Right). In AD
patients, 23 studies were involved including 700 subjects.
Combined effect size was 0.30 (95% CI, 0.19–0.40; left <
right) (Fig. 4). A consistent left-less-than-right asymmetry was
found in all three groups. Meanwhile, by conducting a two
sample t-test for the asymmetry degree among three groups,
only a trend toward signiﬁcance was found (P 5 0.605)
between MCI and control group. Taking right hippocampus as
baseline, the relative left hippocampus average volume reduction weighted by sample size could be obtained as 6.3% (SD
4.9%) in AD, 9.1% (SD 6.5%) in MCI, and 5.8% (SD 4.6%)
in controls.

DISCUSSION
Through these meta-analyses, signiﬁcant bilateral hippocampal atrophy is validated in both MCI and AD patients (Fig. 5).
The extent of hippocampal volume loss in MCI is smaller than
that in AD, which partially supports the fact that MCI is a
transitional stage of AD. In the asymmetry analysis, a left-less-

com.]

than-right pattern is found consistently but with different
extents in all three groups, namely, MCI, AD, and controls.
The disturbance of hippocampus asymmetry may be a characteristic that suggests the onset of illness.
The heterogeneity of studies may come from the following
aspects: (1) Variations in MRI acquisition protocols. In this article, the included studies used 1.5–4T MR machine and the
obtained slice thickness exceeded 3 mm in 3 of 28 studies (de
Toledo-Morrell et al., 2000; Dixon et al., 2002; Sandstrom
et al., 2006). (2) Variations in hippocampal boundary delineation methods (Anstey and Maller, 2003; Campbell et al.,
2004a). In most studies, hippocampus was manually traced by
1–2 neuroanatomists or trained operators in coronal oblique
images acquired perpendicular to the long axis of the body of
the hippocampus according to anatomical guidelines. The raters
were claimed blind to the diagnoses and neuropsychological
performance of all subjects but not blinded to hemisphere (left
or right). The intra- or inter-rater reliability was reported
higher than 0.90. (3) Variations in the characteristics of AD
patients in different studies, such as disease severity, cognitive
proﬁle, family history, and genetic variations like ApoE allele

distribution. For example, the study of Ridha et al. (2006) was
based on autosomal dominant AD patients; while no dominant
inheritance AD patients were included in Basso et al. (2006).
Only four studies provided the Apo E allele distribution in
their subjects as around 50%. (4) Variations in head size correction methods. A total of 12 studies directly provided the
raw volume of hippocampus (Table 1). However, it would be
reasonable to consider the inﬂuence of whole brain volume to
hippocampus volume. A total of 9 studies corrected hippocampus volume with total intracranial volume (TIV), which was
independent with brain atrophy and was proved to be a good
measurement for premorbid brain size and, therefore, a better
measure for adjusting individual differences in brain size. Other
7 studies corrected their volume with the area of speciﬁc slice,
as coronal intracranial area at the level of the anterior commissure (ICA), for which the accuracy was affected by the slice
chosen. So, TIV correction method is recommended to use in
future hippocampus volumetric studies, because it takes the intracranial volume into account and more reasonable than area
correction method.
We ﬁnd signiﬁcant hippocampal atrophy in MCI and AD
groups, which may be the result of neuron loss, because strong
correlations have been found between neuron number and total
hippocampal volume in both AD patients and aging subjects
(Scheff and Price, 2003; Kril et al., 2004). Neurons in human
hippocampus CA1 subﬁeld are signiﬁcantly reduced in AD
patients (Zarow et al., 2005). Moreover, postmortem studies have
shown that such a reduction was in the following order: controls
> MCI patients > mild AD patients (Scheff et al., 2006, 2007).
The measure of hippocampal volume has been used for predicting MCI (DeCarLi et al., 2004; Jack et al., 2005; Apostolova et al., 2006; den Heijer et al., 2006) and AD (Growdon,
1999; Mungas et al., 2002; de Toledo-Morrell et al., 2004).
Recently, the role of hippocampus in the MCI translation has
attracted more attention. One study (Devanand et al., 2007)
found that the hippocampal volume was signiﬁcantly smaller in
MCI converters to AD than in MCI nonconverters. Moreover,
MCI patients with smaller hippocampi (especially the CA1 and
subicular subregion) had an increased risk of converting into
AD patients (Apostolova et al., 2006). However, other studies
reported that the volume of the amygdala or entorhinal may be
more predictive than that of the hippocampus (Dickerson
et al., 2001; Silbert et al., 2003; de Toledo-Morrell et al.,
2004; Stoub et al., 2005; Basso et al., 2006; Wang et al.,
2006b). In general, hippocampal volume may be a nonindependent predictor of the conversion, and other features, such as
age (Hampel et al., 2002; van de Pol et al., 2006a), the volume
of amygdala (Horinek et al., 2006; Horinek et al., 2007) and
entorhinal cortex (EC) (de Toledo-Morrell et al., 2004; Jessen
et al., 2006), and hippocampal shape features (Narr et al.,
2004; Wang et al., 2006a; Li et al., 2007; Scher et al., 2007),
need to be integrated to improve the prediction.
In this study, a left-less-than-right pattern is found in all
three groups, which is consistent with previous studies. In some
studies (Jessen et al., 2006; Ridha et al., 2006; Wolf et al.,
2001), the right hippocampus was found to be signiﬁcantly
Hippocampus

larger than the left in the controls and MCI, but not in AD,
which indicates the asymmetry was the least in AD group. In a
longitudinal study (Barnes et al., 2005), a left-less-than-right
pattern was found in the baseline of AD patients, but this
result was not repeated at a follow-up scan conducted 15
months later, which suggested the asymmetry in AD was
reduced with disease progression. A neonatal study found the
preterm infants tended to have less asymmetrical hippocampus
than full-term infants (Thompson et al., 2008). And males
with schizophrenia established nonsigniﬁcant hippocampus volume asymmetry whereas the control subjects did (Fukuzako
et al., 1997). The abnormal disturbance found in MCI and
AD patients in this study may be a state characteristic, and this
feature may have the potential to be used in tracing the progression of this disease.
There are several limitations in our meta-analyses. One limitation is the publication bias. Because some relevant studies
may not be included in the MEDLINE database and inevitably
missed in this study. Fail-safe number is employed to assess this
bias. Second, MCI has many subtypes. In which, amnestic
MCI was recognized as the closest to Alzheimer’s disease. In
cross-sectional MCI analyses in this article, only 3 of 14 studies
declare their patient subtype as amnestic MCI, which is not
sufﬁcient to conduct a meta-analysis. Third, in hippocampus
delineation, many studies report that their raters are blind to
clinical neuropsychological data, but most of them are not
blind to hemisphere (left or right). The left-right hippocampus
asymmetry found in this study may be affected by rater’s handedness. But considering the asymmetry is obtained by integrating many relevant studies and a signiﬁcant trend is also got
when comparing asymmetry degree in MCI and AD, the asymmetry found is still meaningful. Fourth, the combined effect
sizes are obtained by putting together all relevant studies in AD
and MCI analyses. Note that the subgroup analyses are also
provided and that effect sizes has similar magnitude with the
overall results, it is appropriate to get this combined effect size
for an overview of the degree of hippocampus atrophy in AD
and MCI analyses.
In summary, from the aspect of the extent of hippocampal
volume loss, our results partly support the hypothesis that MCI
is a transitional stage between normal people and AD. Our
study also shows the consistent left-less-than-right asymmetry
in the aging control, MCI, and AD groups, but their different
extents suggest the asymmetry may change dynamically according
to disease progression. These ﬁndings obtained in this study may
be helpful in tracing hippocampus change from normal people to
severe AD patients longitudinally and providing more candidate
markers for predicting MCI and AD.
