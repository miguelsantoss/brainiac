Introduction

Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is deﬁned as abnormal
cognitive state, but does not meet the criteria for the
diagnosis of dementia. In the past MCI was treated as a
transitional state between the physiological aging and
dementia. Currently it is a separate diagnosis, although it
is considered that MCI is a stage of pathophysiological
process of AD [1]. Patients with MCI do not have problems
with function in daily life, sometimes they only need
minimal aid [2]. Patient diagnosed with MCI can present
stable, non-progressive symptoms until the end of his life,
but there can also be observed progression of the disease
(usually gradual), leading to the development of dementia. It
is estimated that the percentage of the conversion to
Alzheimer's disease (AD) is about 10–15% per year [3].
Criteria for diagnosis of MCI from 2011 [1] in addition to
core clinical criteria distinguish research criteria. The
research criteria include an assessment of the biological
markers of neurons' injury, namely:
- markers of b-amyloid (Ab) deposition by assessing the levels
of Ab42 in cerebrospinal ﬂuid or PET amyloid imaging
- markers of neuronal injury by evaluating the levels of total
and phosphorylated tau protein or a reduction in hippocampal volume, or atrophy of the medial temporal lobe in the
magnetic resonance imaging, or hypometabolism in FDGPET, or hypoperfusion in SPECT.
These criteria are important because pathophysiological
process of AD can last even twenty years before onset of
clinical symptoms and MCI is considered as a stage of this
pathophysiological processes following the preclinical phase
of Alzheimer's disease. In MCI phase biomarkers should be
already positive (both markers of Ab deposition and markers of
neuronal injury). A sensitive biomarker will play key role when
causative treatment of AD will be found because then it will be
possible to treat this disease even before the onset of clinical
symptoms.
The aim of this study was to investigate the usefulness of
structural brain magnetic resonance imaging with volumetric
assessment of the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex,
posterior cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal
gyri: superior, medial and inferior, to predict the conversion of
MCI to AD.
The ﬁrst abnormalities in patients who are at risk of AD are
positive markers of deposition of b-amyloid (decreased Ab
concentration in the cerebrospinal ﬂuid and/or positive PET
amyloid imaging). In this study the marker of neuronal injury
was used – structural MRI with volumetric assessment of
selected brain structures (inter alia hippocampus, entorhinal
cortex) because of good availability of magnetic resonance in
Poland (the best of neuroimaging biomarkers) and its noninvasive nature. Furthermore, according to Jack, in the MRI
pathological changes are observed as one of the last
biomarkers [4] and our patients were not in the preclinical
phase – they were diagnosed with MCI. Reduction of the
measured volumes was expected in patients who were at risk
of conversion to AD.

2.

Material and methods

In the study initially participated 163 patients diagnosed with
MCI who were evaluated in Alzheimer's Department of MSW
Hospital in Warsaw. 101 patients remained for further data
analysis (due to lack of follow-up visits or errors in MRI which
precluded further analysis of the data). The patients were aged
50–80 years, mean age 62.7. Neurological assessment, MMSE
(Mini-Mental State Examination), CDT (clock drawing test) and
GDS (Global Deterioration Scale) were performed. The average
score of MMSE was 27.4/30 (range 25–30 points). The average
score of CDT was 8.5/10 points (range 6–10 points) and the
mean score of GDS 2.7 points (range 2–3 points). Laboratory
tests included morphology, TSH, blood glucose, urea, creatinine, transaminases, VDRL (veneral disease research laboratory), levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid and there was no
signiﬁcant abnormalities. Each patient was assessed using
standard neuropsychological tests (according to the standards
described by Gabryelewicz [5]). On CDR scale (Clinical Dementia
Rating), all patients received 0.5 or 0/0.5. For each patient,
follow-up visits were scheduled after 6 months (14 days), 12
months (30 days) and 24 months (50 days). Then patients
were again evaluated neurologically (included MMSE, CDT, GDS
assessment). Neuropsychological examination was performed
to assess potential disease progression. In patients diagnosed
with conversion to AD acetylcholinesterase inhibitor treatment
was initiated. All patients remain under the care of the Memory
Disorders Outpatient Clinic of MSW Hospital in Warsaw.
Brain MRI was performed for each of the patients on a 1.5 T
Toshiba apparatus in the Department of Radiology of MSW
Hospital. Scans were obtained in T2-weighted, FLAIR, DWI
images and also thin 3D T1 Alzheimer sequence. Using
FreeSurfer software volumes of selected structures were
calculated, that is: hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, posterior
cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal gyri: superior, medial, inferior and total intracranial volume. Subsequently, the results have been checked by the same radiologist
to detect and eliminate possible errors which may arise in the
process of segmentation. Each volume (hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal
gyrus, temporal gyri: superior, medial, inferior) was divided
by the total intracranial volume to normalize results and to
make possible comparison between patients and eliminate
differences in the brain size (according to Whitwell [6]). All
volumes were multiplied by 1000 in order to facilitate
comparison between them.

Results

17 of the 101 patients diagnosed with MCI converted into AD
within two years of observation, namely 16.8% (distribution of
diagnosed patients for each visit, Table 1). The study
population was divided into two subgroups:
- Subgroup 1 – non-converters, who did not converted into AD
(84 patients).
- Subgroup 2 – converters, who converted into AD (17
patients).

Average decrease of the volumes in converters compared to
non-converters was achieved for all volumetric measurements, Table 2. The hypothesis of a normal distribution was
positively veriﬁed for all measurements (the results of the
Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, Table 3). The signiﬁcance of intergroup differences was obtained for the majority of measurements except: left posterior cingulate gyrus (t = 1.659, p = 0.100),
left superior temporal gyrus (t = 1.274, p = 0.206) and right

posterior cingulate gyrus (t = 1.202, p = 0.232). The most signiﬁcant differences between groups were found for: left hippocampus (t = 5.708, p < 0.001), left entorhinal cortex (t = 5.473,
p < 0.001), right hippocampus (t = 5.129, p < 0.001), right inferior
temporal gyrus (t = 3.803, p < 0.001) and right entorhinal cortex
(t = 3.676, p < 0.001), Table 3.
Discriminant analysis was conducted and sensitivity for
MCI conversion to AD was 64.7%, speciﬁcity 96.4%. 91% of
patients were correctly classiﬁed (converter or non-converter).
Discriminant analysis was also conducted in the modiﬁed
version with an automatic selection of variables which had the
highest discrimination power. The ﬁnal model took into
account only two variables, which provide the best group
membership: the volume of the left hippocampus and left
entorhinal cortex. Discriminant analysis model using these

two variables was statistically signiﬁcant. Sensitivity of the
measurements of the left hippocampus and left entorhinal
cortex in the prediction of MCI progression to AD was 58.8%.
Sensitivity for these measurements in predicting the stable
form of MCI was the same as using all the measured
parameters, namely 96.4%, and diagnosis classiﬁcation accuracy using left hippocampus and left entorhinal cortex was
90% (for all measurements 91%). The highest sensitivity in
predicting MCI conversion to AD, using a single measurement
was for left hippocampus (52.9%), right hippocampus (41.2%)
and left entorhinal cortex (41.2%).

Discussion

In descriptive statistics presented in Table 2, average
volumes of all structures are smaller in converters comparing
to non-converters (according to the preliminary assumptions). However, statistical analysis showed the superiority of
some measurements. The highest sensitivity of conversion
for single structure was obtained for the left hippocampus
(52.9%), right hippocampus (41.2%) and left entorhinal cortex
(also 41.2%). Unsuitable measurements for assessing MCI to
AD conversion were the volumes of: left and right posterior
cingulate gyrus, left and right superior temporal gyrus and
right medial temporal gyrus (the sensitivity was 0%). Our
results are consistent with the sequence of neuropathological
changes described by Braak [7,8], where entorhinal cortex and
hippocampus are affected as the ﬁrst by the neuropathological process and subsequently cortex of temporal lobes in
stage III and IV. Volumes of superior temporal gyri proved to
be unsuitable probably because of their main role in the
process of auditory sensation, so their role in cognitive
processes is signiﬁcantly lower. The most of the published
studies has evaluated usefulness of hippocampus and
entorhinal cortex volumes in the prediction of MCI conversion to AD. Our study also conﬁrms the highest value of these
two parameters. Studies which assessed additionally, for
example, volume of parahippocampal gyrus, indicated that
the use of this parameter did not increase prediction
sensitivity for conversion to AD [9,10]. In our study the use
of all measured volumes increased sensitivity from 58.8%
(where the volume of the left hippocampus and left
entorhinal cortex was used) to 64.7%. Speciﬁcity in both
cases was 96.4%. Signiﬁcant differences between the sensitivity and speciﬁcity ﬁgures resulted from subgroup size
difference (17 converters and 84 with stable MCI). In other
studies, the percentage of conversion to AD was higher,
namely 27–45% [9–11]. In the few studies [10,12,13] the most
sensitive volumetric measurement was entorhinal cortex
volume. In our study left entorhinal cortex volume was less
sensitive measurement in comparison with left hippocampus volume, as in the Ewers' work [14]. Patients with MCI are
a heterogeneous group and may be at different stages of
neuropathological process, that is why use of hippocampus
and entorhinal cortex volumes seems be the most optimal
method. Volumetric measurements of hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, posterior cingulate gyrus, parahippocampal
gyrus and temporal gyri: superior, medial, inferior showed a
relatively low sensitivity in predicting the conversion of MCI

to AD (in the analysis of all measurements 64.7%). Higher
sensitivity was obtained for predicting stable MCI (96.4%).
The limitation of our study was the number of patients
(101). Studies which drew from either ADNI database (the
Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative) or AddNeuroMed program present the results from signiﬁcantly larger
groups of patients. For example Risacher et al. [15] analyzed
339 patients with MCI from ADNI database. 18.3% converted
into AD per year. Bilateral hippocampal volumes, entorhinal
cortex and temporal gyri thickness were signiﬁcantly reduced
in MCI-converters in comparison to the MCI-stable participants which is consistent with our results except for the left
superior temporal gyrus (LSTG), Table 3. In our study the
volume of LSTG was not signiﬁcantly lower, but in Risarcher
study the thickness, not volume of temporal gyri was
measured. Another study [16] based on ADNI database (Li
et al.) covered 293 patients with MCI and the observation
period lasted 4 years. To predict conversion from MCI to AD the
authors used not only the measured volumes but also
demographic, genetic information, cognitive scores, and the
results of laboratory tests. They employed a hierarchical
interaction model to select the most predictive biosignatures
and interactions between all of the parameters to perform
correct classiﬁcation the patients with MCI (converter or nonconverter). The accuracy of classiﬁcation was almost 75% (the
most effective MRI parameters were precuneus, amygdala,
entorhinal cortex and hippocampus). Percentage of the correct
classiﬁcation in our study using all volumes was 91% but
sensitivity was only 64.7%. Higher correct classiﬁcation rate
in our study was probably due to the large differences between
subgroups (17 converters vs. 84 non-converters). In Li's study
conversion rate was 45% (132 converters vs. 161 nonconverters), so subgroups were almost equivalent.
The study from 2014 [17] presents results using data from
both mentioned databases (ADNI and AddNeuroMed) and
involved 345 patients with MCI. The authors used ordinal
regression model to 1023 baseline structural MRI scans. They
modeled all classes simultaneously (in study were also AD
patients and control group) and applied multivariate ordinal
regression from which they extract a probabilistic prediction
of class membership and an index of AD progression – the
ORCHID score. Classiﬁcation accuracy was 70–75% (ADNIAddNeuroMed); sensitivity of 77% and speciﬁcity of 72%.
This study conﬁrmed results from 2011 [18] in which
multivariate classiﬁcation methods for MRI was used. Data
was from AddNeuroMed database. MCI group was 101 patients
(like in our study) and 19 patients converted into AD during
one year observation. The authors compared correct classiﬁcation accuracy between visual assessment rating scales, a
multivariate MRI classiﬁcation method (with using regional
volume and regional cortical thickness measures, providing 57
variables for multivariate analysis) and manually measured
hippocampal volumes. The best accuracy for predicting
conversion was for the model with automated regional MRI
measures – 79% and 68% accuracy was obtained to other two
methods. Comparable group size with our study proved that
using sophisticated statistical tools can improve the efﬁciency
of the method.
Our study group requires further observation, because in
the following years the proportion of the patients who
