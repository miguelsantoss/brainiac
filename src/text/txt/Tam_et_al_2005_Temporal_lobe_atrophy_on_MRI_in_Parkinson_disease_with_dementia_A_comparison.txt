Abstract—Objective: To investigate the extent of medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) on MRI in Parkinson disease (PD)
with and without dementia compared with Alzheimer disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and to
determine whether MTA correlates with cognitive impairment in PD and PD dementia (PDD). Methods: Coronal T1weighted MRI scans were acquired from control subjects (n ⫽ 39) and patients with PD (n ⫽ 33), PDD (n ⫽ 31), DLB (n ⫽
25), and AD (n ⫽ 31), diagnosed according to standardized clinical diagnostic criteria. Cognitive function was assessed
using the Cambridge Cognitive Examination (CAMCOG), and MTA was rated visually using a standardized (Scheltens)
scale. Results: More severe MTA was seen in PDD (p ⫽ 0.007), DLB (p ⬍ 0.001), and AD (p ⬍ 0.001) vs control subjects.
PD subjects had greater hippocampal atrophy than control subjects (p ⫽ 0.015) but less than subjects with DLB and AD,
though not with PDD. MTA correlated with CAMCOG score and memory scores in the DLB group and with age in control,
PDD, and AD groups. There were no correlations between MTA and cognitive impairment in PD, PDD, and AD. PDD and
DLB had a similar profile of cognitive impairment and MTA. Conclusions: Medial temporal lobe atrophy (MTA) was seen
in cognitively intact older subjects with Parkinson disease (PD) and was not more pronounced in Parkinson disease
dementia (PDD). Alzheimer disease (AD) and, to a lesser extent, dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) showed more
pronounced MTA. Results suggest early hippocampal involvement in PD and that when dementia develops in PD,
anatomic structures apart from the hippocampus are predominantly implicated. Greater hippocampal involvement in AD
vs PDD and DLB is consistent with clinical, cognitive, and pathologic differences between the disorders.

A prospective incidence study reported that more
than three-quarters of an older cohort with Parkinson disease (PD) developed dementia (PDD) during
an 8-year follow-up.1 Early intervention in patients
with PD who are at risk for dementia is important
for future disease-modifying therapies. Structural
neuroimaging has the potential to play an important
role.
Atrophy of the medial temporal lobe (MTA) is a
well-recognized feature of Alzheimer disease (AD)
and can discriminate patients with AD from agematched control subjects.2-4 However, hippocampal
atrophy may not be specific to AD and has been
reported in vascular dementia.5 Studies have shown
medial temporal lobe structures on MRI to be relatively preserved in dementia with Lewy bodies
(DLB) vs AD.6-8 There have been few studies in PDD,
and inconsistencies have emerged. One study reported hippocampal atrophy in PDD to be even
greater than in AD,9 whereas others have found hippocampal atrophy in nondemented PD that correlated with impaired episodic memory.10,11
Studies using more sensitive serial MRI methods

have shown significantly greater annual brain volume loss in nondemented PD patients vs control subjects.12,13 We have previously used voxel-based
morphometry to demonstrate atrophy of the frontal
lobe in PD that extends to temporal, occipital, and
parietal lobes in PDD.14
We sought to compare the extent of MTA assessed
visually from MRI scans in subjects with PD with
and without dementia and those with DLB and AD
and control subjects and to examine the relationship
between MTA and cognitive and noncognitive symptoms. We hypothesized that MTA would be less common in PDD and DLB than in AD and that MTA
would be more frequent in PD than control subjects.
Methods. Subjects. The sample consisted of 159 subjects (33
with PD, 31 with PDD, 25 with DLB, 31 with AD, and 39 healthy
elderly control subjects). Subjects underwent MRI scans as part of
a baseline assessment in a prospective longitudinal study of dementia. Patients were recruited from hospital and communitydwelling populations under the care of old age psychiatrists,
geriatricians, and neurologists. Control subjects were recruited
from friends and spouses of patients or caregivers. The Newcastle
and North Tyneside Ethics Committee approved the study. All
subjects gave written informed consent to participate.

Assessment and diagnosis. Subjects underwent detailed physical, neurologic, and neuropsychiatric examinations, which included clinical history and mental state and physical examination
and, for demented subjects, a standardized blood screen with thyroid function tests, vitamin B12, folate, and syphilis serology.
Standardized schedules administered included the Mini-Mental
State Examination (MMSE),15 Cambridge Cognitive Examination
(CAMCOG),16 and Neuropsychiatric Inventory.17 Diagnosis was
made by consensus between experienced clinicians using the National Institute of Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and
Stoke/Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for AD,18 the consensus criteria for DLB and PDD,19 and the
UK Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank criteria for PD.20
Twenty-seven patients with AD met criteria for probable AD and
4 for possible AD, 22 DLB patients fulfilled probable and 3 fulfilled possible DLB criteria, whereas all PD and PDD patients met
the clinical diagnostic criteria for PD. The distinction between
DLB and PDD was made on the basis of the duration of the
parkinsonism, as recommended by the consensus diagnostic criteria for DLB.19 Patients whose dementia developed either before or
within 12 months of the onset of parkinsonism were classified as
DLB. Those whose dementia developed 12 months or later after
the onset of PD were classified as PDD.
Exclusion criteria for normal subjects were evidence of dementia (either from history, mental state examination, or score of ⬍80
on the CAMCOG) or any other major psychiatric, neurologic, or
physical disorder including drug and alcohol abuse.
MRI procedure. All scans were performed on a 1.5 T GE
Signa scanner (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI). Whole-brain T1weighed three-dimensional fast spin echo spoiled gradient echo data
sets were acquired in the coronal plane (repetition time ⫽ 12.4 milliseconds, echo time ⫽ 4.2 milliseconds, inversion time ⫽ 650 milliseconds, matrix ⫽ 256 ⫻ 256, slice thickness ⫽ 1.6 mm, flip angle ⫽ 15°,
field of view ⫽ 20 cm, in-plane resolution ⫽ 0.78 ⫻ 0.78 mm), yielding 124 contiguous slices through the head. Standard head positioning was used throughout.
MTA rating. A widely used standardized scale (Scheltens
Scale) was used to rate left and right MTA from hard copies of
T1-weighted coronal images.3 This scale rates atrophy as 0 (absent), 1 (minimal), 2 (mild), 3 (moderate), and 4 (severe) based on
the width of the surrounding CSF spaces (temporal horn and
choroid fissure) and the height of the hippocampal formation
(which includes the hippocampus proper, subiculum, and parahippocampal and dentate gyri). An example of the different severities
of MTA is shown in figure 1. For the purpose of analysis, left and
right scores were summed to give an overall combined MTA score,
ranging from 0 to 8. All scans were rated by the same trained
rater blinded to clinical diagnosis. Interrater reliability was assessed between the trained rater and an experienced rater by
measuring 20 subjects. Intrarater reliability was assessed by measuring 20 subjects on two occasions.
Statistical analysis. The statistical package SPSS for Windows (version 11; Chicago, IL) was used for data analysis. Differences between groups on continuous variables were assessed
using analysis of variance with post-hoc Tukey tests to determine
group differences. For nonparametric data, Kruskal–Wallis analysis of variance was used followed by a post-hoc Mann–Whitney U
test or Pearson ␹2 statistic as appropriate. Correlations between
MTA scores, age, and cognitive function were examined using the
Spearman rank order correlation coefficient. All statistical tests
were two tailed and were regarded as significant at p ⬍ 0.05.
Interrater reliability for visual ratings of scans was assessed using weighted ␬ that controls for chance agreement between raters.

Results. Reliability. Interrater reliability was regarded
as satisfactory. Weighted ␬ values for visual ratings of
atrophy were as follows: right MTA 0.60 and left MTA
0.57. Intrarater reliability was excellent with weighed ␬
values for visual ratings of atrophy as follows: right MTA
0.90 and left MTA 0.86.
Demographic and cognitive characteristics. The demographic and clinical characteristics of all groups are summarized in table 1. Groups were matched for sex and
broadly matched for age, although the AD group was older
than the PDD group (p ⬍ 0.001). Educational level did not

At the time of MRI scan, 25 (76%) patients with PD, 27

levodopa. Those patients taking cholinesterase inhibitors
included seven (23%) with PDD, eight (26%) with AD, and
eight (32%) with DLB. All patients underwent assessments
and MRI scans while receiving their medication.

groups had lower scores than the control and PD groups on

cognitive assessments (i.e., memory, p ⫽ 0.092; orientation, p ⫽ 0.228).
Differences in MTA. Table 3 summarizes the combined
scores of MTA in each group. MTA was greater on the left
in all groups except the AD group. However, the asymmetry was not significant (control, p ⫽ 0.302; PD, p ⫽ 0.593;
PDD, p ⫽ 0.197). There were differences in the combined
MTA scores in different diagnostic groups (␹2 [4] ⫽ 61.08,
p ⬍ 0.001). MTA of the control group was less than that of
PD, PDD, AD, and DLB groups (p ⫽ 0.015 for PD and p ⫽
0.007 for PDD, p ⬍ 0.001 for AD and DLB). The AD group
had more MTA vs PD, PDD, and DLB groups (p ⬍ 0.001).
DLB had more MTA vs PD (p ⫽ 0.01). Differences in MTA
between PD and PDD (p ⫽ 0.267) or between PDD and
DLB (p ⫽ 0.203) were not significant. MTA showed a pattern (control ⬍ PD ⵑ PDD ⵑ DLB ⬍ AD) (tables 3 and 4).
There is some overlap between groups on combined MTA
rating (figure 2). Ratings of ⱖ5 were unusual in control
subjects (only 6/39 cases), whereas ratings of ⬍5 were unusual in AD (2/31 cases).
Correlation of MTA ratings with age and cognitive impairment. Age was associated with combined MTA score

in the control (␳ ⫽ 0.41, p ⫽ 0.009), PDD (␳ ⫽ 0.39, p ⫽
0.032), and AD (␳ ⫽ 0.44, p ⫽ 0.013) groups but not in PD
(␳ ⫽ 0.34, p ⫽ 0.054). In normal control subjects, language
comprehension and total scores of CAMCOG inversely correlated with combined MTA rating (␳ ⫽ ⫺0.36, p ⫽ 0.023;
␳ ⫽ ⫺0.35, p ⫽ 0.029). In subjects with DLB, language
expression (␳ ⫽ ⫺0.53, p ⫽ 0.008), orientation (␳ ⫽ ⫺0.60,
p ⫽ 0.002), memory (remote: ␳ ⫽ ⫺0.60, p ⫽ 0.002; recent:
␳ ⫽ ⫺0.44, p ⫽ 0.027; total: ␳ ⫽ ⫺0.48, p ⫽ 0.017), MMSE
(␳ ⫽ ⫺0.49, p ⫽ 0.014), and total CAMCOG (␳ ⫽ ⫺0.51,
p ⫽ 0.014) scores inversely correlated with combined MTA
ratings. There were no correlations between MTA rating
and cognitive impairment in PD, PDD, and AD groups.
There were no correlations between frequency or severity
of neuropsychiatric symptoms and MTA ratings in any
dementia groups.

Discussion. Our data confirm previous reports
that patients with PD without dementia have more
MTA than age-matched control subjects. This implies that older PD subjects have progressive MTA
before the onset of dementia. In our study, PD subjects had more impairment in language expression
(including verbal fluency) and executive function
than the control subjects. These findings are consistent with reports from community-based studies in
early PD, showing cognitive impairments in 36% of
newly diagnosed and nondemented PD cases, with a
profile and associated imaging changes indicative of
frontostriatal dysfunction.21,22 Mild cognitive impairments of this type in a PD patient in conjunction
with concomitant hippocampal atrophy might provide a presymptomatic marker for dementia risk.

mentia in PD include older age, older age at onset of
PD, male sex, longer duration of symptoms, decreased verbal fluency, and axial motor impairment.
Prospective study is needed to further clarify these
associations.
MTA in PDD was less severe than in AD, more
closely resembling that seen in DLB. These findings
are in agreement with previous volumetric10 and autopsy23 studies and consistent with previous observations using voxel-based morphometry of gray matter
loss in temporal lobes in the same sample.14 Differences in MTA between the demented groups could
not be explained by different durations of cognitive
symptoms or severity of global cognitive impairment.
All three demented groups had more extensive MTA
than age-matched control subjects. Previous studies
have also reported increased atrophy of temporal
lobe structures in both PDD and DLB, and neuropathologic studies find the CA2 to CA3 region of the
hippocampus to be mainly affected in DLB, whereas

PD ⫽ Parkinson disease; PDD ⫽ Parkinson disease dementia;
DLB ⫽ dementia with Lewy bodies; AD ⫽ Alzheimer disease.

AD is characterized by involvement of CA1 hippocampus and entorhinal cortex.24
The profiles of cognitive impairment in PDD,
DLB, and AD groups were consistent with previous
studies.25 AD subjects had more memory impairment
and less impairment in attention, visuospatial, and
executive function vs PDD and DLB subjects. Only
the DLB group had correlations between memory,
global cognitive function, and MTA. Recent studies
have found memory and MMSE score correlated with
hippocampal volume in DLB,7 AD,26 and also PD and
PDD.10 The absence of correlation could be due to the
relatively simple visual scale, which is a global rating including hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus,
and ventricles, which may not match onto a cognitive
task in such a way as a single measurement (e.g., of
hippocampus). Also possible were floor effects in AD
subjects on the MTA rating, as most AD cases scored
6 or 8 out of 8 on the combined score.
The major strength of this study is the recruitment of a large number of community-based elderly
patients with late-life dementia, with comparable
age, sex, education, and duration of dementia. MR
images were acquired using a standardized protocol,
and atrophy was assessed blind to diagnosis using
an established scale with satisfactory reliability. A
potential criticism of this study is the reliance on
clinical, rather than pathologic, diagnoses. However,
clinical diagnoses were made after detailed assessment and in accordance with standardized criteria in
a center with a proven track record of high accuracy
as judged by autopsy confirmation.27
