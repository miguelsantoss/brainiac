Abstract: Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) may have
hippocampal atrophy compared with controls. We compared
hippocampal, and extra-hippocampal volumes between PD,
PDD (patients with PD who have mild cognitive impairment or
dementia), Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and controls using volumetric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants (10
patients with PD, 10 with PDD, 11 with AD, and 12 control
subjects) had an informant interview, neurological examination, and psychometric testing. Established, reliable methods
were used to measure the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, temporal, frontal, and parieto-occipital lobes. Correction
for intracranial volume was carried out before comparison.
There was no age difference between groups (mean age, 74
years). On the Clinical Dementia Rating scale (CDR) cognitive
impairment was mild (CDR ⫽ 0.5) in the majority of PDD and

AD patients. Hippocampal (P ⬍ 0.0004) volumes were smaller
in the patient groups. Effect sizes compared with the control
group were: PD, 0.66; PDD, 1.22; and AD, 1.81. The other
volumes did not differ signiﬁcantly. Among PD and PDD
patients, recognition memory (r ⫽ 0.54, P ⫽ 0.015) and
Mini-Mental State Examination scores (r ⫽ 0.56, P ⫽ 0.01)
correlated with left, but not right hippocampal volume. In
conclusion, hippocampal volume showed a pattern (Control ⬎
PD ⬎ PDD ⬎ AD) suggesting progressive hippocampal volume loss in PD. Volumetric MRI imaging might provide an
early marker for dementia in PD. © 2003 Movement Disorder

Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD), the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder, are at high
risk for the development of dementia. Incidence rates for
dementia range from 4.2 to 9.5% per year.1,2 The prevalence of dementia in PD ranges from 10 to 30%. Thus,
PD with dementia may represent the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer’s disease (AD).
Dementia in PD is associated with a high risk of nursing
home placement3 and death.4 Early intervention in PD
patients who are at risk for dementia would be ideal, but
accurate diagnosis and prediction is necessary.

Prediction of dementia is imperfect. Incidence studies
have identiﬁed risk factors, which include older age,
male gender, longer duration of symptoms, speciﬁc aspects of cognitive dysfunction (e.g., decreased verbal
ﬂuency)5,6 and axial motor impairment (which responds
poorly to dopaminergic treatment).7 A structural or functional neuroimaging marker might complement other
clinical and neuropsychological predictors.
Two previous studies demonstrated that hippocampal atrophy is evident in PD with or without dementia.8,9 Similar ﬁndings are observed in dementia with
Lewy bodies (DLB), where diffuse Lewy bodies and,
in many cases, the pathologic features of AD cooccur.10 –12 These changes overlap with those seen in
PD with dementia (PDD),13,14 but DLB is distinguished by overlapping onset of dementia and parkinsonism within 12 months along with hallucinations
and ﬂuctuations.15 Except for ﬂuctuations, none of the
core features are distinctive for DLB. Visual hallucinations, for example, are common in PD, especially in

patients with coexistent dementia, highlighting the
clinical overlap of DLB and PDD.16 –18
We sought to conﬁrm that hippocampal atrophy was
evident in an independent sample of patients with PD
with very mild cognitive impairment or dementia compared with healthy elderly and non-demented PD using
whole-brain volumetric imaging. Speciﬁcally, we examined hippocampal and extrahippocampal regions to discern if the pattern of atrophy differed between PD and
AD. Based on previous work, we hypothesized that hippocampal atrophy would be present at an early stage in
older patients with PD, but would be of lesser severity
than that seen in AD. Furthermore, we predicted that the
pattern of atrophy would differ between PDD and AD.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Subjects
Subjects were recruited from the Parkinson Center of
Oregon Movement Disorders Clinic, the Oregon Aging
and Alzheimer Disease Clinic, and the Oregon Brain
Aging Study.19 Parkinson’s disease was deﬁned by the
presence of two signs among resting tremor, rigidity, and
bradykinesia, consistent with the UK Brain Bank criteria.20 Parkinson’s disease with dementia patients required a diagnosis of PD to have preceded the diagnosis
of dementia or cognitive impairment by at least one year.
This information was collected by history obtained from
an informant, and was used to operationally exclude
DLB cases where dementia and parkinsonism occurred
within one year.14
Dementia was deﬁned according to DSM-IV criteria.21
Cognitive impairment was staged using the Clinical Dementia Rating Scale (CDR),22 which has been used previously in staging dementia in PD.23 A rating of 0.5, termed
questionable or very mild dementia, indicates persistent
memory impairment, or mild cognitive or functional
change, representing a change from a previous level of
function and was the minimal criterion for cognitive impairment. Some patients at this stage may not meet strict
criteria for dementia in that functional decline was not
required for the present study. Nevertheless, all cognitively
impaired and demented PD patients were referred to as
PDD. Higher stages on the CDR represent more severe
dementia: 1, mild dementia; 2, moderate dementia; 3, severe dementia. Those with AD met criteria for probable AD
according to the NINCDS-ADRDA.24
Methods used for the Oregon Brain Aging Study, a
longitudinal study of healthy aging, have been described
previously.25 All patients and controls underwent an interview with an informant that was used to provide
information to diagnose dementia and obtain a CDR

staging. Cognitive testing was used as supportive evidence for cognitive impairment. All non-demented PD
patients and controls had no persistent cognitive or functional complaints or cognitive problems reported by the
patient or the informant.
Behavioral–Cognitive Assessment
Twenty PD patients had cognitive and motor assessments. Three additional PD patients were recruited and
assessed, but the scans could not be analyzed for technical reasons. Their data was not included in this report.
Baseline cognitive abilities were characterized by the
Wide-Range Achievement Test–Reading, version 2
(WRAT-R2).26 The Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE) was carried out with all subjects.27 Depression
was assessed in the PD patients and controls using the
Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS).28 Behavioral problems were documented using the Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI).29 Cognitive assessments carried out for
the PD patients included the CERAD word list recall and
recognition test.30
Controls and patients with AD were assessed as described previously and were age, gender and dementia
severity (CDR) matched to the PD subject from a pool of
available MRI scans. Cognitive tests reported represent
those administered to subjects in all groups.
Motor Assessment
Standard clinical assessments were used to rate
tremor, bradykinesia, rigidity, gait, and balance.31 The
Uniﬁed Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) was
used to rate PD patients who entered the study. This was
only available for the PD patients. None of the control
subjects and AD patients exhibited parkinsonism
clinically.
MR Imaging
MRI scans were obtained on a 1.5-Tesla GE scanner,
with the following image parameters: multi-echo, multiplanar, 4-mm coronal slices, 24-cm2 FOV, 256 ⫻ 256
matrix, NEX ⫽ 0.5, TR ⫽ 3000 msec, TE ⫽ 30 and 80
msec as described previously.32 Image analysis was carried out by semiautomated recursive segmentation using
the program REGION, and by manual tracing using NIH
Image v. 1.5 on Macintosh computers. Total pixel counts
for each region were summed for each slice and multiplied by the slice thickness to convert areas to volumes.
Hippocampal and parahippocampal volumes were measured by manually tracing the hippocampal areas on
serial slices located between the red nucleus and the
superior colliculus as described previously.32 Intracranial
(suparatentorial) volume was deﬁned as non-bone pixels

beginning with the ﬁrst slice in which the frontal poles
were present and ending at the occipital poles; excluding
brainstem and cerebellar structures. Intracranial volumes
were determined by recursive segmentation using REGION. In this semiautomated program, representative
pixels of tissue types of interest (bone, brain, and
cerebrospinal ﬂuid) are sampled on each slice using
predetermined sampling guidelines. The recursive segmentation is completed automatically by applying a discriminant function to identify all non-bone pixels contiguous to the intracranial sample points. Any manual
tracing required to correct the automated segmentation is
carried out according to strict atlas-based rules. Subsequent segmentation allows measurement of brain and
cerebrospinal ﬂuid in a similar manner. These analysis
techniques have been shown previously to be reliable:

and left hemisphere volumes was examined because we
did not hypothesize that hippocampal degeneration
would be lateralized.
Statistical Analysis
Groups were compared using ␹2 tests, t-tests or analysis of variance (ANOVA) for direct comparisons and
multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) for simultaneous examination of all brain regions and cognitive
function; ANOVA and Fisher’s PLSD test were used for
post hoc comparisons. Total amount of levodopa (Ldopa) equivalents were calculated for the patient groups
according to the formula: Total equivalents ⫽ regular

tables. Although there was no signiﬁcant group difference in intracranial volume (ICV), groups were compared after dividing the volume by the intracranial volume as described previously.35 To assure that the disease
group differences were not related to the statistically
insigniﬁcant increased number of males in the cognitively intact PD group, analyses were repeated after
excluding that group. Right and left hemisphere volumes
were combined for all between-group comparisons because we did not hypothesize that one side would be
more likely to be associated with cognitive impairment;
moreover, right and left hippocampal volumes did not
differ from each other (t ⫽ 0.61, P ⫽ 0.55). Correlation
between memory and MMSE scores and left and right
hippocampal volumes were examined among the patients
with PD to determine if cognitive function might be
associated speciﬁcally with focal hippocampal atrophy
and to test the hypothesis that verbal memory would be
associated with left and not right hippocampal atrophy.
Post hoc ANCOVA comparing directly the AD and PDD
was carried out, after adjusting for MMSE, to determine
if dementia severity might account for any trend in
parahippocampal volumes observed. Effect sizes were
calculated for each of the patient groups by subtracting
the mean brain volume in the disease group from the
mean volume in the control group and then dividing by
the overall standard deviation. A P value of 0.05 was
used for as the threshold for statistical signiﬁcance.
RESULTS
Data regarding the baseline characteristics of the subjects are presented in Table 1. Groups were matched for
age and education. Although there were more men in the
PD without cognitive impairment, there was no statisti-

DISCUSSION
Our data conﬁrm that PD patients with or without
cognitive impairment have more hippocampal atrophy
than healthy age-matched control subjects, with volumes
similar to that in patients with mild AD. Differences in
parahippocampal volumes were of borderline signiﬁcance, and trends observed were related to dementia
severity. Differences in temporal and frontal lobe volume
and parieto-occipital lobes were not signiﬁcant in this
sample. Thus, hippocampal atrophy is evident in older
PD patients before the onset of dementia. Effect sizes
observed were modest for all comparisons, with a trend

for hippocampal atrophy of AD ⬎ PDD ⬎ PD, compared
with controls.
We have extended previous research by examining a
mild spectrum of disease using quantitative, whole brain
neuroimaging. Previous pathological 36 –39 and imagingbased volumetric studies8,9 that have examined more
advanced patients with PD are consistent with our study.
Hippocampal atrophy also occurs in DLB, which overlaps pathologically with PDD, where hippocampal volume is intermediate between that observed in controls
and in those with AD with sparing of the parahippocampal gyrus.40
Our study was limited by a small sample size, and by
the fact that the non-demented PD group was predominantly male. Nevertheless, the difference in gender distribution between groups was not signiﬁcant statistically
and the other patient groups, including the PDD group,
were well matched. A larger intracranial volume in men
would bias against our ﬁnding of a decreased hippocampal volume in PD, compared with controls, arguing that
this ﬁnding is valid. A greater number of men in the
cognitively intact PD group would bias toward ﬁnding
larger volumes in that group; however, we have adjusted
for intracranial capacity using accepted methods, and the
overall MANOVA remained signiﬁcant after excluding
that group. Although we had a small sample size, our
current subjects were independent of those reported in
our pilot study that showed similar ﬁndings, and therefore are conﬁrmatory.8 Based on our pilot study, we
included a number of PD patients similar to those of
Laakso and associates.9
In DLB the rate of brain atrophy does not differ from
that in AD or vascular dementia.41 In a comparison with
controls and patients with progressive supranuclear
palsy, patients with PD (on average 5 years younger than
those in our study) did not show hippocampal atrophy,
raising the possibility that atrophy is accelerated in PD.42
A recent study demonstrated that cognitive decline was

PD AND HIPPOCAMPAL ATROPHY
correlated with global brain atrophy in PD.43 A previous
volumetric study of patients with PD suggested that
hippocampal atrophy might be correlated with episodic
memory, consistent with our ﬁnding of a relationship
between cognitive function and left hippocampal volume.44 Given the high risk of dementia in people with
PD and the ﬁnding that atrophy precedes the onset of
dementia, our study raises the possibility that focal atrophy might provide a presymptomatic marker for dementia risk. Nevertheless, given that atrophy in both cognitively impaired and unimpaired subjects was similar,
additional changes must be invoked to explain dementia
in PD.
One interpretation of the trend to larger parahippocampal volumes in PDD is that the PDD subjects were
at a milder stage of disease. Given that, after adjustment
for MMSE, there was no clearly signiﬁcant difference in
parahippocampal volumes between the AD and PDD
groups, it is likely that dementia severity accounts for
this ﬁnding. On the other hand, the PDD and AD groups
did not differ in the distribution of CDR levels or on the
MMSE, both of which reﬂect global cognitive function.
Although sparing of parahippocampal and temporal lobe
structures also has been noted in DLB compared with
AD in imaging studies,45,46 a recent pathological study
found that parahippocampal involvement with Lewy
body and neuritic pathology was associated with dementia in patients with PD and DLB, consistent with involvement of these regions in PDD.14 Involvement of the
subiculum was shown recently for DLB, but not PD,
suggesting that the pattern of atrophy might differ in
these two entities.47
Our data examining cortical regions, including parieto-occipital lobe volumes, are consistent with a recent
study that showed speciﬁc sparing of occipital volume in
DLB compared with AD and controls.48 In our study, as
in many of the previous imaging studies, there was
considerable overlap between patient groups with respect
to each of the brain volumes examined (see Fig. 1).
Given our small sample size, we did not carry out subgroup analyses to examine the possibility of clinical
heterogeneity.
In summary, we have shown that hippocampal atrophy
may distinguish PD from healthy controls. Hippocampal
changes resemble those seen in patients with mild AD
and may correlate with cognitive function. Prospective
studies will determine if this provides a presymptomatic
marker for dementia in PD and if the evolution of atrophy in PD resembles that seen in other neurodegenerative disorders. Ongoing research using higher resolution
MRI scans will allow further, more precise deﬁnition of
the pattern of brain atrophy, especially in the medial

789

temporal lobes. Pathological correlation with atrophy on
MRI will be required to determine if PDD is distinct
from DLB.
