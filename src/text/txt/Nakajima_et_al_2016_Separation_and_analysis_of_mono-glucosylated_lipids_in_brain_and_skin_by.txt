a b s t r a c t
Mono-glycosylated sphingolipids and glycerophospholipids play important roles in diverse biological
processes and are linked to a variety of pathologies, such as Parkinson disease. The precise identiﬁcation of the carbohydrate head group of these lipids is complicated by their isobaric nature and by
substantial differences in concentration in different biological samples. To overcome these obstacles, we
developed a zwitterionic (ZIC)-hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) electrospray ionization
tandem mass spectrometry method. ZIC-HILIC preferentially retains inositol, followed by glucose- and
galactose-featuring lipids. Comparison with unmodiﬁed silica gel HILIC stationary phase revealed different retention speciﬁcity. To evaluate the precision of ZIC-HILIC, we quantiﬁed glucosyl- (GlcCer) and
galactosylceramides (GalCer) in seven different regions of the mouse brain and discovered that GlcCer
and GalCer concentrations are inversely related. The highest GalCer (lowest GlcCer) content was found
in the medulla oblongata and hippocampus, whereas the highest GlcCer (lowest GalCer) content was
found in other regions. With a neutral loss scan, ZIC-HILIC resolved glucosylceramide species featuring
non-hydroxylated fatty acid, hydroxylated fatty acid, and trihydroxy sphingoid bases in mouse epidermis
samples. This demonstrates that our ZIC-HILIC-based approach is a valuable tool for characterizing the
structural diversity of mono-glucosylated lipids in biological material and for quantifying these important
lipids.

1. Introduction
Mono-glucosylated lipids, such as glucosylceramide (GlcCer),
phosphatidylglucoside (PtdGlc), and cholesterylglucoside (ChlGlc),
play important roles in various biological processes [1–3]. For
example, GlcCer is a key intermediate in the synthesis of most

glycosphingolipids, and it also acts as a glucose donor in ChlGlc
biosynthesis [4]. In brain tissue, the glucose head group of GlcCer
is predominantly replaced by its C4 epimer, galactose, giving rise
to galactosylceramide (GalCer). GlcCer and GalCer are integral to
neural function, performing different roles in the brain. GalCer is
a component of myelin and plays a critical role in myelin-related
functions [5], whereas GlcCer is involved in axonal growth [6,7]. On
the other hand, PtdGlc, a novel glycerol-type glucosylated lipid, is
a minor component of lipid rafts [8]. Recently, PtdGlc was found to
serve as an important guidance cue for spinal cord sensory axons
after it undergoes hydrolysis by phospholipases to lyso-PtdGlc
[9]. However, phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns), the isobaric isomer of
PtdGlc, is abundantly present in brain.
In non-neural tissues, GlcCer exhibits structural complexity, and each GlcCer species has distinctive functions, as in
ceramide species [10]. In skin, acylated or hydroxylated GlcCer are
involved in epidermal cell differentiation [11,12]. Consequently, a
highly reproducible analytical method capable of isometric-based

K. Nakajima et al. / J. Chromatogr. B 1031 (2016) 146–153

separation via the carbohydrate and ceramide moiety is highly
desired in order to gain a better understanding of the biological
functions of mono-glycosylated lipids.
Liquid chromatography (LC) electrospray ionization tandem
mass spectrometry (ESI–MS/MS) is a powerful tool for lipidomic
analyses. Further improvement is achieved via a two-dimensional
LC setup, featuring a combination of two different chromatographic
methods. This setup enhances identiﬁcation of minor lipid species
in qualitative analysis as well as reproducibility in quantitative
analysis [13,14]. Reversed-phase chromatography is used widely to
separate lipid samples, primarily based on the length and degree
of saturation of their respective alkyl chains. Unfortunately, subtle
alterations of the head group, such as substituting glucose for galactose, cannot be resolved [15]. By contrast, hydrophilic interaction
chromatography (HILIC), a type of normal phase chromatography, is able to resolve lipids based on their head groups [16–18].
HILIC separation is based on the analyte partitioning between
acetonitrile-rich mobile phase and a water-rich layer absorbed on
the hydrophilic stationary phase. More hydrophilic analytes are
retained on the column as their partitioning equilibrium shifts more
toward the water layer on the stationary phase [19,20].
While the HILIC method was initially developed for the separation of amino acids, the successful separation of GlcCer from
GalCer has also been reported using a fused-core silica and amino
column [21,22]. More recently, a HILIC-based method using ultraperformance LC and supercritical ﬂuid chromatography has been
demonstrated to discriminate sufﬁciently between GlcCer and GalCer in brain tissue samples [23,24]. While these approaches have
been used to quantify both GlcCer and GalCer, they suffer from substantial variability among different samples [21–24]. Consequently,
an alternative method with improved resolution of complex GlcCer
would be highly desirable.
A zwitterionic (ZIC) stationary phase consists of oppositely
charged groups and is a phase that can be used to separate phospholipid classes based on electrostatic interactions [25]. In general,
a ZIC stationary phase retains a thick hydration layer that generates strong hydrophilic interactions with analytes [20]. This feature
facilitates the separation of conﬁgurational isomers and the discrimination of hydroxylated molecules, such as glycopeptides and
carbohydrates [26–29].
In the present study, we evaluated the efﬁcacy of ZIC-HILIC
stationary phases for isometric separation of a variety of glucosylated lipid classes. Following method optimization, we ﬁrst
compared the chromatographic behaviors of two classes of glycolipids on a ZIC-HILIC with an unmodiﬁed silica gel HILIC stationary
phase. Next, we evaluated the utility and reproducibility of our
method for the quantitative analysis of GlcCer in brain tissue and
demonstrated that it is highly suitable for analyzing other glycolipids, such as PtdGlc and PtdIns. Additionally, the successful
discrimination of complex epidermal GlcCer mixtures based on
their ceramide moieties via a two-column setup conﬁrmed the suitability of our ZIC-HILIC method for characterizing the carbohydrate
and ceramide moieties of GlcCer simultaneously.

2. Materials and methods
2.1. Materials
Lipid standards were purchased from Avanti Polar lipids
(Andover, MA, USA). PtdGlc (18:0/20:0), PtdGlc (18:0/18:0), PtdGal
(18:0/20:0), and acetylated-PtdGlc (18:0/20:0) were synthesized,
as we reported previously [30,31]. Ammonium formate was purchased from Sigma Aldrich Japan (Tokyo, Japan). Acetonitrile and
methanol were purchased from Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc (Waltham,
MA, USA). Chloroform and distilled water were purchased from

147

Kanto Kagaku (Tokyo, Japan). The solvents were of HPLC grade. All
other materials were either from WAKO (Osaka, Japan) or Sigma
Aldrich Japan. All materials and solvents were used as supplied
without further puriﬁcation.
2.2. Lipid extraction
All animal experiments were performed in compliance with
RIKEN institutional guidelines. Ten-week-old and 9-month-old
C57BL/6 J mice (Charles River Laboratories, Japan) were deeply
anesthetized, and the cranium was carefully dissected open. The
entire brain was removed and divided into seven parts based
mostly on standard anatomical regions: olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, hippocampus, cortex, and
other regions not included in the ﬁrst six. Each separated region
was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored until analysis. Mouse epidermal sheets were obtained according to previous
reports [11,12].
Total lipids were extracted from lyophilized tissues added with
GlcCer (d18:0/12:0) containing 5 pmol/mg of lyophilized tissue,
according to the method of Bligh and Dyer [32]. The total lipid
extracts were hydrolyzed in 2 ml of 0.1 M potassium hydroxide in
chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) for 2 h at room temperature, neutralized with acetic acid [21], and partitioned according to the Folch
method. The lower phase was collected and dried under a stream
of nitrogen. Lipids from mouse epidermal sheets were precipitated
in acetone (2 ml) for 2 h on ice and collected by centrifugation.
2.3. LC–MS/MS analysis
Samples were analyzed on a semi-micro LC system 100XL (Eksigent, Dublin, CA, USA) coupled to a triple quadrupole linear ion trap
mass spectrometer, QTRAP4500 (SCIEX, Toronto, Canada).
2.3.1. Chromatographic conditions
Chromatographic conditions based on a previous report [18]
were modiﬁed as described below. ZIC column with phosphocholine phase (ZIC-cHILIC, 2.1 mm i.d. × 150 mm, 3 ␮m; Merck
SeQuant, Umea, Sweden); ZIC column with sulfobetaine phase
(2.1 mm i.d. × 150 mm, 3.5 ␮m; Merck SeQuant); and Atlantes silica HILIC column (2.1 mm i.d. × 150 mm, 3 ␮m; Waters, MA, USA)
were used as indicated and regenerated weekly with 30 column volumes of washing solution (acetonitrile/water, 80:20, v/v).
ZIC columns with phosphocholine and sulfobetaine phase were
equilibrated with mobile phase A (acetonitrile/water/formic acid,
96/3/1, v/v/v, with 5 mM ammonium formate) and the Atlantes
silica HILIC column with an alternative mobile phase A (acetonitrile/methanol/formic acid, 97/2/1, v/v/v, with 5 mM ammonium
formate), each at a ﬂow rate of 150 ␮l/ml.
Samples were dissolved in chloroform/methanol (4/1, v/v),
diluted 10-fold with mobile phase A, and a 10 ␮l aliquot was
injected via an injector valve equipped with a 20 ␮l sample loop
ﬁlled with acetonitrile. Upon injection, the chromatography gradient and data collection by the mass spectrometry was initiated.
Lipids were eluted with the following gradient of mobile phase B
(methanol/water/formic acid, 89/10/1, v/v/v, with 20 mM ammonium formate): 0% B over 3.3 min; 0–70% linear increase of B over
16.7 min; 70–100% linear gradient of B over 1 min; 100% washing
with B for 5 min; and ﬁnally equilibrated with A for 20 min.
To allow comparison of the chromatographic behaviors between
the employed HILIC columns, the retention factors (k) of phosphatidyl hexosides and PtdIns were calculated. The dead time
(t0 = 3.33 ± 0.4) was determined with benzophenone (50 pmol) in
three experiments.

2.3.2. ESI–MS/MS conditions
First, the optimal conditions for GlcCer (d18:1/12:0) and PtdGlc
(18:0/20:0) were determined by adjusting the declustering potential, entrance potential, collision energy, and collision cell exit
potential. Subsequently, the ionization conditions were optimized.
Analysis of target lipids was conducted in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode using speciﬁc precursor-product ion
pairs. The employed precursor ions (Q1), product ions (Q3), and collision energies are summarized in Table S1. PtdGlc was analyzed
in the negative ion mode according to our previous report [33],
using the following settings: ion spray voltage, −4500 V; curtain
gas, 30 psi; temperature, 600 ◦ C. GlcCer was analyzed in the positive ion mode with the following settings: ion spray voltage, 5000 V;
curtain gas, 30 psi; temperature, 200 ◦ C. The neutral-loss scan for
hexosylceramide (HexCer)-speciﬁc detection was performed with
the following settings according to our previous report [34]: neutral loss, 180 Da; scan range of the instrument, m/z 400–1000; scan
speed, 2,000/s; collision energy, 30 eV.
Each peak was integrated using MultiQuant software and quantiﬁed based on the peak areas of each standard. GlcCer and GalCer
content was normalized against the internal standard (GlcCer,
d18:1/12:0) recovery and expressed as pmol/mg lyophilized tissues. The values represent the averages of three experiments.
2.4. High-performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC)
Lipid mixtures dissolved in chloroform/methanol (2:1, v/v) were
separated on a boric acid coated HPTLC plate (silica gel 60; Merck
Millipore, Germany), and developed in chloroform/methanol/2.5 M
ammonia solution (65:35:8, v/v/v) [35]. Neutral glycosphingolipids

were visualized by spraying orcinol reagent, followed by heating on
a hot plate at 120 ◦ C for 10 min. Identities of the stained lipids were
ascertained by reference standards.

3. Results and discussion
3.1. Optimization and reproducibility
HILIC separation of lipids is usually achieved with mobile phases
composed of 95–97% acetonitrile in water or a volatile solvent
[16–19,21,22,25]. For example, bacterial phospholipids are separated on ZIC-HILIC with a mobile phase containing 5% water [25].
In the present study, we selected an acetonitrile/water mixture
(96:4, v/v) containing 5 mM ammonium formate, which sufﬁciently
retained GlcCer and PtdGlc samples on the column. In order to
ensure reproducible results, the column was regenerated with acetonitrile/water (80:20, v/v) prior to each analysis.
The reproducibility of elution times and peak areas was conﬁrmed by analyzing a synthetic mixture of PtdGlc (18:0/18:0) and
PtdIns (18:0/18:0). Over seven runs, the results were highly reproducible (Fig. S1), with a retention time coefﬁcients of variation (CV)
for PtdGlc and PtdIns of ∼0.9%. The peak area CVs of PtdGlc and
PtdIns were 6.7% and 7.4%, respectively. This represents a signiﬁcant improvement compared with our previously reported method
based on normal phase chromatography with a chloroform-based
solvent system [33], demonstrating the suitability of ZIC-HILIC to
reliably quantify PtdGlc.

glucosylceramide (GlcCer) species present in minute quantities in brain tissue (asterisk) were separated from galactosylceramide (GalCer) and quantiﬁed.

3.2. ZIC-HILIC versus unmodiﬁed silica gel HILIC
Next we compared the chromatographic behaviors of standard
reference materials, such as HexCers, phosphatidyl hexosides, and
PtdIns (Fig. 1), on an unmodiﬁed silica gel HILIC with ZIC-HILIC.
The HexCer species with d18:1/24:1, d18:1/16:0, and d18:1/12:0
were monitored by the following MRM pairs: Q1/Q3 = 810.6/264.4,
700.6/264.4, and 644.6/264.4, respectively, using product ions of
the dehydration sphingolipid base at m/z 264.4 [36,37]. On ZICHILIC (Fig. 1A), glucose-featuring HexCer species were eluted
after their corresponding galactose analogs, mutually separating GlcCer and GalCer species. Phosphatidyl hexosides exhibited
the same carbohydrate-dependent elution pattern (Fig. 1B, Fig.
S2), as indicated by their respective retention factors for PtdGlc
sn = 1.2 18:0/20:0 (k = 3.38) and PtdGal 18:0/20:0 (k = 3.36). The
preferential retention of glucosylated lipids compared with their
galactosylated analogs was also observed on a sulfobetaine stationary phase (Fig. S3). By contrast, on an unmodiﬁed silica gel
HILIC stationary phase, galactosylated glycolipids were preferentially retained, as indicated by the respective retention factors for
PtdGlc (k = 2.90) compared with PtdGal (k = 3.00). Taken together,
the preferential retention of glucosylated compared with galactosylated glycolipids appears to be due to the hydrophilic interactions
that occur with increased thickness of the hydration layer of the
stationary phase [38].
The effect of the fatty acid chain pattern on the retention times
was strikingly similar in all columns used. In general, increasing the
fatty acyl chain length weakened analyte retention and resulted
in reduced retention times. For example, both GlcCer and GalCer
featuring a d18:1/12:0 ceramide moiety were eluted later than
their d18:1/24:1 ceramide-featuring analogs. By contrast, alteration of the stereoconﬁguration of the glycerol moiety gave almost

identical retention factors (Fig. 1B). Acetylated PtdGlc (k = 3.16) (i.e.,
6-O-acetylation) was weakly retained on the column and therefore
eluted earlier than that of non-acetylated PtdGlc. Inositides, such
as PtdIns (k = 3.61) and lyso-PtdIns (k = 4.51), were eluted later than
their respective glucoside and galactoside analogs in all employed
systems. Together, these results correspond well to our previously
reported observations using normal phase chromatography [33].

3.3. Analysis of hexosylceramides in brain tissue
To demonstrate the applicability of our ZIC-HILIC method over
a broad range of biologically relevant concentrations, the monohexosylceramide content present in total lipid extracts from whole
mouse brain tissue at postnatal day 5 (P5) and adult 10-weekold mice was quantiﬁed. In contrast to the large amount of GalCer
present in adult mouse brain, P5 mouse brain tissue contains only
a small amount [39]. The integrity of our brain samples was conﬁrmed with a boric acid-impregnated TLC plate and co-migration
with standards. As expected, low amounts of HexCers were found
in P5 mouse brain tissue, and GalCer was predominantly found
in adult mouse brain (Fig. 2A). The MRM proﬁles (Fig. 2B, GlcCer
species indicated by asterisks) demonstrated that regardless of the
large amount of GalCer, GlcCer was still well resolved.
The major fatty acid present in GlcCer from P5 mouse brain
was stearic acid (Fig. 2B, P5, light green, d18:1/18:0), whereas the
predominant fatty acid in GalCer from adult mouse brain was a
nervonic acid residue (d18:1/24:1). In adult mouse brain, the preference for long chain fatty acids of GalCer is preserved. GalCer
featuring ␣-hydroxylated (␣OHFA) long chain fatty acids exhibited a longer retention time compared to their non-hydroxylated
(non-OHFA) analogs. ␣OHFAs are characteristically present in

GalCer species, which is the predominant constituent in adult
mouse brain.
To evaluate the reproducibility of our HILIC methods, the HexCer species, extracted from 9-month-old mouse brains (Table 1),
were repeatedly analyzed. An unnatural GlcCer (d18:1/12:0) was
added to validate the feasibility of the extraction method. Its recovery was also appropriately 93.8 ± 13.4% (n = 4). Across four samples
the relative standard deviations (RSD) on ZIC-HILIC were reproducible, with a range of 6.3% to 35.6%. The unmodiﬁed silica gel
HILIC RSDs were within 6.5% to 42.3%. In both cases, the determined concentration of low abundant constituents, such as GlcCer
(d18:1/16:0), GlcCer (d18:1/20:0), and GlcCer (d18:1/22:0), was
comparable, although their respective RSDs were relatively high.
Taken together, these results demonstrate that our method is sufﬁciently robust for the quantiﬁcation of GlcCer in biological samples,
such as brain tissue.
3.4. Distribution of HexCer in brain
Imaging mass spectrometry is a powerful tool for determining
the spatial distribution of lipids in the brain [40]. Because of the isobaric nature of HexCer, this technique is incapable of discriminating
between different carbohydrate moieties, thus precluding the analysis of minor GlcCer species [41]. Using our ZIC-HILIC method,
the concentrations of 14 species of HexCer were determined
in seven different regions of adult mouse brain: olfactory bulb,

hypothalamus, cerebellum, medulla oblongata, hippocampus, cortex, and other regions (Fig. 3 and Table S2). In each region, the
total amount of GalCer exceeded GlcCer. The medulla oblongata
and hippocampus were especially rich in GalCer, but poor in GlcCer. In contrast, olfactory bulb, hypothalamus, cortex, and other
regions exhibited the highest GlcCer content, but the lowest GalCer content. Thus, the distribution of GlcCer compared to GalCer
in brain regions exhibited an inverse relationship, rationalizing the
variation of GalCer excess (between 50- and 350-fold) compared to
GlcCer.
In terms of fatty acid modiﬁcation of the ceramide moiety, sizeable amounts of palmitic acid (16:0) were detected in the GlcCer
fraction isolated from the olfactory bulb (Fig. 3: red). Stearic acid
(18:0) was the main fatty acid found in the four GlcCer-rich regions
(Fig. 3: light green). By contrast, the highest content of stearic
acid (18:0)-featuring GalCer was in the medulla oblongata and
hippocampus, coinciding with the lowest content of stearic acid
(18:0)-featuring modiﬁed GlcCer. A similar inverse pattern was
observed for arachidic acid (20:0), behenic acid (22:0), and lignoceric acid (24:0), despite their relatively low content in GlcCer
and GalCer. Nervonic acid (24:1) is the major fatty acid modiﬁcation found in GalCer, which is speciﬁcally enriched in the medulla
oblongata and hippocampus (Fig. 3: blue). In the case of GlcCer, nervonic acid-featuring species were distributed evenly. ␣-Hydroxy
fatty acids were found only in the GalCer fraction, with the highest
content in the olfactory bulb.

Fig. 4. HILIC-ESI–MS/MS of lipid mixtures extracted from mouse epidermis. (A) Extracted ion chromatograms generated by a neutral-loss scan. Detected peaks were divided
into three classes based on retention times (ZIC-HILIC: Z1, Z2, and Z3; unmodiﬁed silica gel column: S1, S2, and S3). (B) Mass spectra eluted around each group. Class S3 was
separated into two peaks on ZIC-HILIC (Z2: GlcCer species with HFA; Z3: GlcCer species with a trihydroxy sphingoid base).

This heterogeneous distribution of HexCer species likely is
related to their region-speciﬁc function. For example, a substantial part of white matter is composed of myelin sheath tissue that
is rich in nervonic acid-featuring GalCer [42,43]. Consequently, the
high content of GalCer with nervonic acid species in the medulla
oblongata and hippocampus correlate well with the high content
of white matter in these regions of the brain. Therefore, the distinct
HexCer composition of each analyzed brain region and the considerable ﬂuctuation of their respective regional content highlights the
importance of quantifying local alterations in HexCer composition
at the onset and during the progression of neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson disease. If slight differences in GlcCer levels
need to be measured further during disease progression, samples should also be analyzed with the HILIC-ESI–MS/MS method
combined with an ion-mobility system, which we are currently
developing. Taken together, our ZIC-HILIC method is exceptionally suitable for analyzing signiﬁcant differences in minor GlcCer
content across different brain regions.

3.5. Qualitative analysis of hexosylceramide in skin
In general, the epidermis is composed of a complex mixture of
hexosylceramides, with a considerable diversity in their ceramide
moiety. This includes the presence of an additional hydroxyl group
at the ␣- or ␻-position of the fatty acid residue, or at the long
chain base, sphingoid base moieties such as 4-hydroxysphinganine
or 6-hydroxysphingosine [11,12]. By contrast, the carbohydrate
moiety lacks diversity, as it is limited primarily to glucose [44].
Consequently, characterization of the HexCer mixture in mouse
epidermis samples is ideal for demonstrating the versatility of our
method to discriminate compounds based on differences in their
ceramide moiety. To assess the complexity of the ceramide moieties, we detected and characterized HexCers based on LC retention
times and m/z values by neutral loss scan. The neutral loss of 180 Da

has been previously associated with the loss of a hexosyl residue
by cleavage of its glycosidic linkage [34].
Three distinct classes (Z1, Z2 and Z3) of HexCers were clearly
separated by our ZIC-HILIC method based on differences in their
ceramide moiety (Fig. 4A). Class Z1 seemed to lack any additional
hydroxylation, but did possess a variety of fatty acid residues
between C16:0 to C24:1 (Fig. 4B; ZIC-HILIC and Table 2). Class Z2
and Z3 were exclusively composed of HexCer, with an additional
hydroxyl group. The ∼2 min shift in the retention time of class Z2
compared with class Z1 and the observed m/z values were indicative of an additional hydroxyl group at either the ␣- or ␻-position
of the fatty acid residue (HFA: ␣OHFA or ␻OHFA). By contrast,
m/z values of class Z3 corresponded to known sphingolipids with
a trihydroxy long chain base, such as 4-hydroxy-sphinganine and
6-hydroxy-sphingosine [12,45].
For comparison, we used an unmodiﬁed silica gel HILIC column
to analyze the epidermal HexCer mixture (Fig. 4A). This method
resolved classes S1 and S2, which correspond to non-hydroxylated
HexCer, and class S3, which corresponds to a mixture of fatty
acids and long chain base hydroxylated HexCer. Interestingly, the
ions present in class S1 were predominantly 2 Da heavier than
the ions present in class S2, indicating a higher degree of saturation in the long chain base moiety. For example, the m/z value at
812 in S1 and at 810 in S2 corresponded to GlcCer (d18:0/24:1)
and GlcCer (d18:1/24:1), respectively. Thus, the method using
an unmodiﬁed silica gel column was capable of discriminating
between GlcCer species with sphingosine (S2) and those with sphinganine (S1). However, the full characterization of unidentiﬁed
signals, such as m/z 798.7 and m/z 810.7, will require additional
experiments (Fig. 4A, Table 2). Additionally, minor components
such as GlcCer containing ␣OHFA and trihydroxy sphingoid bases
should be characterized. Currently, we are also developing a twodimensional HILIC-MS method combined with a reversed-phase
mode to efﬁciently characterize minor GlcCer species. These results

4. Conclusions
We established and validated the reproducibility of a novel
ZIC-HILIC-based HPLC–MS/MS method for the analysis of glycosphingolipids and glycophospholipids. The preferred retention
of Ins > Glc > Gal allowed the outright identiﬁcation of the carbohydrate moiety despite their isobaric nature. Additionally, GlcCer,
the minor component in brain samples, was conﬁdently analyzed,
even in the presence of a 350 times excess of GalCer. In skin samples, our ZIC-HILIC method demonstrated its potential to resolve
fatty acid and long chain base hydroxylation. Comparison of our
new method with an unmodiﬁed silica gel HILIC column revealed
an inverted retention proﬁle and separation characteristics with
respect to the lipid moiety. Thus, our approach with two HILIC
methods successfully quantiﬁed glucosylated lipids in brain and
skin tissues.
