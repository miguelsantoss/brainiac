AbstractObjective To investigate the extent medial temporal lobe atrophy MTA MRI Parkinson disease PD 
with and without dementia compared with Alzheimer disease AD and dementia with Lewy bodies DLB and 
determine whether MTA correlates with cognitive impairment PD and PD dementia PDD Methods Coronal weighted MRI scans were acquired from control subjects and patients with PD PDD DLB 
 and AD diagnosed according standardized clinical diagnostic criteria Cognitive function was assessed
using the Cambridge Cognitive Examination CAMCOG and MTA was rated visually using standardized Scheltens 
scale Results More severe MTA was seen PDD DLB and AD control subjects 
PD subjects had greater hippocampal atrophy than control subjects but less than subjects with DLB and AD 
though not with PDD MTA correlated with CAMCOG score and memory scores the DLB group and with age control 
PDD and AD groups There were correlations between MTA and cognitive impairment PD PDD and AD PDD and
DLB had similar profile cognitive impairment and MTA Conclusions Medial temporal lobe atrophy MTA was seen
 cognitively intact older subjects with Parkinson disease PD and was not more pronounced Parkinson disease
dementia PDD Alzheimer disease AD and lesser extent dementia with Lewy bodies DLB showed more
pronounced MTA Results suggest early hippocampal involvement PD and that when dementia develops PD 
anatomic structures apart from the hippocampus are predominantly implicated Greater hippocampal involvement AD
 PDD and DLB consistent with clinical cognitive and pathologic differences between the disorders 
NEUROLOGY 
A prospective incidence study reported that more
than three quarters older cohort with Parkinson disease PD developed dementia PDD during
 year follow Early intervention patients
with PD who are risk for dementia important
for future disease modifying therapies Structural
neuroimaging has the potential play important
role 
Atrophy the medial temporal lobe MTA 
well recognized feature Alzheimer disease AD 
and can discriminate patients with AD from agematched control subjects However hippocampal
atrophy may not specific AD and has been
reported vascular dementia Studies have shown
medial temporal lobe structures MRI relatively preserved dementia with Lewy bodies
 DLB AD There have been few studies PDD 
and inconsistencies have emerged One study reported hippocampal atrophy PDD even
greater than AD whereas others have found hippocampal atrophy nondemented PD that correlated with impaired episodic memory 
Studies using more sensitive serial MRI methods
have shown significantly greater annual brain volume loss nondemented PD patients control subjects We have previously used voxel based
morphometry demonstrate atrophy the frontal
lobe PD that extends temporal occipital and
parietal lobes PDD 
We sought compare the extent MTA assessed
visually from MRI scans subjects with PD with
and without dementia and those with DLB and AD
and control subjects and examine the relationship
between MTA and cognitive and noncognitive symptoms We hypothesized that MTA would less common PDD and DLB than AD and that MTA
would more frequent PD than control subjects 
Methods Subjects The sample consisted subjects 
with PD with PDD with DLB with AD and healthy
elderly control subjects Subjects underwent MRI scans part 
 baseline assessment prospective longitudinal study dementia Patients were recruited from hospital and communitydwelling populations under the care old age psychiatrists 
geriatricians and neurologists Control subjects were recruited
from friends and spouses patients caregivers The Newcastle
and North Tyneside Ethics Committee approved the study All
subjects gave written informed consent participate

Assessment and diagnosis Subjects underwent detailed physical neurologic and neuropsychiatric examinations which included clinical history and mental state and physical examination
and for demented subjects standardized blood screen with thyroid function tests vitamin folate and syphilis serology 
Standardized schedules administered included the Mini Mental
State Examination MMSE Cambridge Cognitive Examination
 CAMCOG and Neuropsychiatric Inventory Diagnosis was
made consensus between experienced clinicians using the National Institute Neurologic and Communicative Disorders and
Stoke Alzheimers Disease and Related Disorders Association criteria for AD the consensus criteria for DLB and PDD and the
UK Parkinsons Disease Society Brain Bank criteria for PD 
Twenty seven patients with AD met criteria for probable AD and
 for possible AD DLB patients fulfilled probable and fulfilled possible DLB criteria whereas all PD and PDD patients met
the clinical diagnostic criteria for PD The distinction between
DLB and PDD was made the basis the duration the
parkinsonism recommended the consensus diagnostic criteria for DLB Patients whose dementia developed either before 
within months the onset parkinsonism were classified 
DLB Those whose dementia developed months later after
the onset PD were classified PDD 
Exclusion criteria for normal subjects were evidence dementia either from history mental state examination score 
 the CAMCOG any other major psychiatric neurologic 
physical disorder including drug and alcohol abuse 
MRI procedure All scans were performed T GE
Signa scanner General Electric Milwaukee WI Whole brain weighed three dimensional fast spin echo spoiled gradient echo data
sets were acquired the coronal plane repetition time milliseconds echo time milliseconds inversion time milliseconds matrix slice thickness flip angle 
field view plane resolution yielding contiguous slices through the head Standard head positioning was used throughout 
MTA rating A widely used standardized scale Scheltens
Scale was used rate left and right MTA from hard copies 
 weighted coronal images This scale rates atrophy absent minimal mild moderate and severe based 
the width the surrounding CSF spaces temporal horn and
choroid fissure and the height the hippocampal formation
 which includes the hippocampus proper subiculum and parahippocampal and dentate gyri An example the different severities
 MTA shown figure For the purpose analysis left and
right scores were summed give overall combined MTA score 
ranging from All scans were rated the same trained
rater blinded clinical diagnosis Interrater reliability was assessed between the trained rater and experienced rater 
measuring subjects Intrarater reliability was assessed measuring subjects two occasions 
Statistical analysis The statistical package SPSS for Windows version Chicago IL was used for data analysis Differences between groups continuous variables were assessed
using analysis variance with post hoc Tukey tests determine
group differences For nonparametric data KruskalWallis analysis variance was used followed post hoc MannWhitney U
test Pearson statistic appropriate Correlations between
MTA scores age and cognitive function were examined using the
Spearman rank order correlation coefficient All statistical tests
were two tailed and were regarded significant 
Interrater reliability for visual ratings scans was assessed using weighted that controls for chance agreement between raters 
Results Reliability Interrater reliability was regarded
 satisfactory Weighted values for visual ratings 
atrophy were follows right MTA and left MTA
 Intrarater reliability was excellent with weighed 
values for visual ratings atrophy follows right MTA
 and left MTA

Discussion Our data confirm previous reports
that patients with PD without dementia have more
MTA than age matched control subjects This implies that older PD subjects have progressive MTA
before the onset dementia In our study PD subjects had more impairment language expression
 including verbal fluency and executive function
than the control subjects These findings are consistent with reports from community based studies 
early PD showing cognitive impairments 
newly diagnosed and nondemented PD cases with 
profile and associated imaging changes indicative 
frontostriatal dysfunction Mild cognitive impairments this type PD patient conjunction
with concomitant hippocampal atrophy might provide presymptomatic marker for dementia risk

All three demented groups had more extensive MTA

the DLB group had correlations between memory 
global cognitive function and MTA Recent studies
