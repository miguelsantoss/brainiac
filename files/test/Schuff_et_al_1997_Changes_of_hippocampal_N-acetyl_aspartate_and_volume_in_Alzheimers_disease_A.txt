Article abstract-Hippocampal atrophy detected by MRI is a prominent feature of early Alzheimer's disease (AD),but it
is likely that MRI underestimates the degree of hippocampal neuron loss, because reactive gliosis attenuates atrophy. We
tested the hypothesis t h a t hippocampal N-acetyl aspartate (NAA, a neuronal marker) and volume used together providcb
greater discrimination between AD and normal elderly t h a n does either measure alone. We used proton MR spectroscopic
imaging ( ' H MRSI) and tissue segmented and volumetric MR images to measure atrophy-corrected hippocampal NAA alld
volumes in 12 A13 patients (mild to moderate severity) and 17 control subjects of comparable age. In AD, atrophy-corrected
NAA from the hippocampal region was reduced by 15.5% on the right and 16.2%,on the left (both p .:'0.003), and
hippocampal volumes were smaller by 20.1% ( p <0.003) on t h e right and 21.8%)( p <0.001) on the left when compared
with control subjects. The NAA reductions and volume losses made independent contributions to t h e discrimination of AD
patients from control subjects. When used separately, neither hippocampal NAA nor volume achieved to classify correctly
AD patients better than 80%.When used together, however, the two measures correctly classified 90% of AD patients iind
94'1 of control subjects. In conclusion, hippocampal NAA measured by 'H MRSI combined with quantitative measurements of hippocampal atrophy by MRI may improve diagnosis of AD.

Neuropathologic studies of brains from patients with
Alzheimer's disease (AD) demonstrate neuritic
plaques and neurofibrillary lesions, accompanied by
neuron loss and gliosis. Neuron loss results in atrophy of the cerebral cortex and other neuroncontaining structures, including the hippocampal
formation. Hippocampal atrophy in AD has been associated with impairment of declarative memory
functions that are characteristic symptoms of AD.'
Previous studies on AD patients using MRI found
atrophy of the hippocampus.2 Although, an initial
MRI study of hippocampal atrophy reported a complete separation of AD patients from healthy elderly," other studies of larger numbers of subjects
showed some overlap between these groups.4,gOne
possible reason for this overlap is that t o the degree
neurons are replaced by glial cells, tissue atrophy in
AD is attenuated.
Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ('H MRS)
and 'H MRS imaging ('H MRSI) detect, important
cerebral metabolites in vivo, including the amino
acid N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), which is specifically

located in neurons and absent in glia." In the presence of reactive gliosis, NAA measured by ' H MRSI
may be a more sensitive marker of neuron loss than
atrophy measured by MRI. We7 and other,? li have
documented a decrease of NAA in various brain regions of AD patients. Furthermore, MacKay et al.,".
who found reduced NAA in the supraventricular cortex of AD patients, showed that these NAA reductions were to some degree independent from MRI
changes, and demonstrated that when N.4A measures were combined with measurements of ventricular volumes, AD patients and control subjects could
be better classified than with either measure alone.
Finally, a recent study17 using multislice 'H MRSI
demonstrated a regional pattern of NAA reductions
in AD involving the frontal, temporal, and parietal
cortices, which is consistent with the known distribution of AD pathology.
Initially, technical considerations complicated ' H
MRSI measurements from the hippocampal region.

partial volume effects, including variations in the
tissue composition of MRSI voxels. Therefore, the
goals of this s t u d y w e r e (1) t o test t h e hypothesis
that NAA measured by ‘H MRSI is lower in the
hippocampus of AD patients compared w i t h control
subjects, ( 2 ) t o d e m o n s t r a t e that t h e s e NAA reductions are n o t an artifact of partial volume effects,
(3) to confirm previous reports that hippocampal volu m e m e a s u r e d by MRI is smaller in AD p a t i e n t s
than in control subjects, and (4)to test the hypothesis that hippocampal NAA and volume contribute
i n d e p e n d e n t information regarding AD pathology
that, w h e n used together, provide greater discrimination between AD and control subjects than either
m e a s u r e alone.

Methods. Patients and control subjects. Twelve patients (mean age ? SD, 74.3 ? 8.0 years; range, 55 to 82
years; eight women and four men) with the diagnosis of
AD (nine probable and three possible) according to the
NINCDWADRDA criteria2z and with a mild or moderate
level of dementia severity (Mini-Mental State Examination
[MMSEILH
scores >12), and 17 cognitively normal subjects
of similar age and sex distribution were studied. The diagnosis of possible AD for three patients was based on the
observation that at the time of the evaluation two of these
patients had thyroid problems and another suspected neurosyphilis. All subjects were recruited from the University
of California (UC) San Francisco and the UC Davis Alzheimer Centers, were examined by a neurologist, and had the
standard battery of blood and neuropsychological tests at
the Centers. The 1 7 control subjects had an evaluation
similar to that of the AD patients and were judged to be
cognitively normal and functioning. None of the patients or
control subjects had evidence of stroke, cortical or subcortical infarctions, or other major abnormalities on MRI,
which were read by a neuroradiologist (D.N.). The protocol
was approved by the Committee on Human Research at
UC San Francisco, and all subjects or their legal guardians
gave written informed consent before participating in the
study. The 1-hour-long combined MRIAIRSI examination
was completed by 10 AD patients and all control subjects.
Two other patients requested to be taken out of the magnet before MRIAIRSI was completed. One of these patients
finished MRI for segmentation and voluming, while the
other had MRI for segmentation only. MRSI from one of
the control subjects was not considered for analysis because of poor spectral quality, whereas MRI from this subject was satisfactory.
MRIIMRSI examinations. All studies were performed
on a 1.5-T Magnetom VISION system (Siemens Inc., Iselin,
NJ) equipped with a standard quadrature head coil. To
minimize motion of the subject’s head, a vacuum-molded
head holder Wac-Pac, Olympic Medical, Seattle, WA) was
employed to restrict head movements. The MRI protocol
consisted of sagittal T1-weighted localizer scans, oblique
axial double spin-echo (DSE) scans angulated parallel to
1514 NEUROLOGY 49 December 1997

the optic nerve a s seen in the sagittal plane, and a volumetric (three-dimensional [3Dl) magnetization prepared
rapid gradient echo (MP-RAGE) acquisition angulated perpendicular to the DSE image planes yielding T1-weighted
coronal images estimated to be orthogonal to the long axis
of the hippocampus. The measurement parameters of DSE
were TRITE,RE, = 3,000/20/80 ms, 1.0 x 1.4 mm‘ resolution, and 48 to 51 contiguous, 3-mm-thick slices covering
the entire brain from the inferior cerebellum to the vertex.
The measurement parameters of 3D MP-RAGE were TR/
TIRE = 10/250/4 ms, flip angle = 15 deg; 1.0 x 1.0 mm’
resolution, and 1.4-mm-thick partitions.
‘H MRSI data sets were acquired using a spin-echo
two-dimensional MRSI sequence a t T W E = 1,800/135 ms
with preselection of a region of interest (PRESS volume),
requiring a total acquisition time of about 13 minutes. The
PRESS volume was angulated parallel to the long axis of
the hippocampi as seen from the sagittal scout images and
positioned on the axial plane to cover both hippocampi in
their entire length and adjacent sections of the midbrain
and the temporal lobes. The MRSI field of view was 210 x
210 mm2 and was sampled using a circular k-space scheme
equivalent to a maximum of 24 X 24 phase encoding
steps,24resulting in a nominal voxel resolution of 1.1mL.
The spectral sweep width was 1,000 Hz. Figure 1 shows
axial T1-weighted MR images from an 80-year-old AD patient (figure 1A) and a 74-year-old control subject (figure
1B) at the position of the hippocampus and the corresponding NAA images, restricted to the sensitive area of the
PRESS volume. Also shown are representative ‘H MR
spectra selected from the hippocampal body of the AD patient and control subject (location and approximate size of
the MRSI voxel is indicated by a circle in the corresponding MRI). The three prominent resonances in the ‘H MR
spectrum are from NAA, and Cho- and creatine (Crk
containing compounds.
MRI segmentation and “voluming.” Tissue segmentation on the whole brain and voluming of the hippocampus
was performed using software developed in house (GF).
The semiautomated segmentation software uses both T1weighted MP-RAGE and T2-weighted spin-echo images.
The first-pass segmentation procedure automatically removes the skull and meninges from the images, coregisters

the cluster analysis, seeds for each tissue category. i.e.,
gray matter [GM], white matter [WMJ, and CSF are first
defined based on regions around the peaks in the T1 pixel
intensity histogram. These regions represent conservative
estimates of the appropriate tissue category. If desired, the
initial process is followed by manual editing of the data to
separate cortical from subcortical GM, ventricular CSF
from sulcal CSF, and to reclassify pixels incorrectly classified as GM into a category of WM signal hyperintensity.
The number of pixels for each tissue category is expressed
as a percentage of total intracranial volume (TIV), which
equals the total number of pixels.
Quantitative estimates of the volumes of the right and
left hippocampus were obtained using coronal T1-weighted
MP-RAGE images, resliced perpendicular to the long axis

of the hippocampus. Boundaries of the hippocampus were
drawn following specifically the guidelines of Watson et
aI.lhThe areas of all regions of interest were then automatically calculated and the total volume derived by multiplying t h a t value by t h e slice thickness. All volume
measurements were performed by the same rater (D.A.),
who was blinded to the subject's diagnosis. To evaluate
reliability of volume measurements, data from 16 arbitrarily selected subjects were independently volumed a
second time by another experienced operator. The correlation coefficient between these two measurements was
'4.92. To adjust for interindividual variations in head
size, each subject's hippocampal volume, H P ' , was normalized to hislher intracranial volume index, TZVITIV'"',
where TIV represents the mean total intracranial volume
of the control group and TZV'" is each subject's total intracranial volume, computed from the segmented images.
This procedure maintains the dimension of the normalized
hippocampal volumes, in contrast to t h e normalization by
ZITIV'", and is justified as long as the mean TIV values of
the study groups are not significantly different. In this
population, patients and control subjects had comparable
TIV values (difference < l%,p >0.96 by ANOVA), although
others'!' found a modest correlation between reduced TIV
sizcs and deficits of some cognitive functions.

for coil loading, receiver gain, and metabolite TI and T2
relaxation rates, using T 1 and T2 values from a p-reviously
reported 'H MRS study in healthy elderly." It was nssumed t h a t metabolite relaxation rates were the same for
AD patients and normal elderly, and for GM and WM.
To obtain atrophy-corrected metabolite intensities and
to verify t h a t metabolic changes were not an artifact of
partial voluming, all MRSI data in this study were analyzed for variations of voxel compositions in terms of GM,
WM, and CSF using software developed in house (F.E..
G.F.). This computation used the tissue segmented images
coregistered with the MRSI data to estimate the coniposition of MRSI voxels and was performed with consideration
of the MRSI point spread function, chemical shift displacement effects, and signal sensitivity across the PRESS volume, which was determined experimentally on a headsized phantom. Assuming t h a t no metabolites are observed
in CSF, t h e composition of each MRSI voxel can be characterized by two parameters: tissue content, p = (GM +
W M ) , and gray matter index, f = G M / ( G M + W M ) . Then,
atrophy-corrected metabolite intensities (i.e., of NAA) were
computed according to

with NAA" being the uncorrected intensity, and f as the
covariate for the statistical analysis to determine the extent to which the tissue composition contributed to metabolite differences.
Typically, MRSI spectra obtained from the hippocampal
body exhibited a better spectral resolution than spectra
from the hippocampal head, which often were degraded
from poor B,-field homogeneities in this region and f ~ i r thermore contained more GM than voxels from the tail,
reflecting the brain anatomy in this region. We c.oncludcd
that MR spectra from the hippocampal body would best br

@AS, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, "2)was used to test group
differences of hippocampal volumes and gross atrophy
measures. ANCOVA (BMDP, Statistical Solutions Inc.,
Cork, Ireland) with tissue composition f as the covariate
was used to test, by group and by side, differences of metabolite concentrations in the right and left hippocampus.
To determine the extent that hippocampal NAA and volume were independent of each other, NAA was used a s the
independent variable and volume a s covariate, and vice

versa, to determine group membership by ANCOVA. Results are expressed as mean i- SE unless otherwise indicated. The level of significance for differences is p (0.05.

Results. Demographics. The demographic data are
summarized in table 1. Patients and elderly control subjects were comparable in age ( p >0.5 ANOVA) and had a
similar gender distribution (67% and 82% women in the
patient and control groups, respectively). The AD patients
had a mean MMSE score of 18.4 -+ 5.2 (SD) with a range
from 12 to 28, and an average duration of symptoms of
4.2 ? 1.8 (SD) years. Elderly control subjects had MMSE
scores of a t least 28 or better.

In both groups, NAA, Cr, and Cho concentrations were not
significantly higher in the left than in t h e right hippocampus ( p >0.7). p reveals that MRSI voxels from AD patients
contained on average 10% less tissue than control subjects,
reflecting the increased atrophy in AD patients. Accordingly, the difference of hippocampal NAA between t h e
groups without atrophy correction (which reflects both
NAA and volume changes) was about 40% larger than with
correction of atrophy. This emphasizes the importance of
correcting MRS and MRSI data for partial volume effects.

in hippocampal NAA, volume losses in AD remained significant ( p <0.001). Taken together, these results reveal that
hippocampal NAA and volume each provide independent
information relevant to the discrimination of AD patients
from control subjects. Neither NAA, nor volume, nor the
combination of both (NAA x volume) could distinguish
possible from probable AD ( p > 0.7 by ANOVA). This
suggests that the MRI and MRSI differences between AD
patients and control subjects were not skewed by including
the patients with possible AD. Finally, we tested whether
the discrimination between AD patients and control subjects by the hippocampal NAA X volume index remains
significant after adjusting for variations of age and dementia severity (as measured by MMSE) using ANCOVA. We
found that neither age ( p = 0.27) nor MMSE ( p = 0.96)
contributed significantly to the difference of the NAA x
volume index between the groups, suggesting that the index is to a large extent independent from the patients’ age
and dementia severity.
Figure 3 shows the distribution of atrophy-corrected
hippocampal NAA (right and left averaged) from each AD
patient and control subject as a function of hisher hippocampal volume (right and left averaged). To determine
the classification power of hippocampal NAA and volume
when combined, we performed a stepwise linear discriminant analysis with hippocampal NAA being the first variable entered. Alone, hippocampal NAA correctly classified
80% (8 of 10) of the AD patients and 75% (12 of 16) of the
control subjects. When hippocampal volume was entered,
the two measures combined increased classification of AD
patients and control subjects to 90% (9 of 10) and 94% (15

Discussion. The major findings of this study were
( 1) atrophy-corrected NAA concentrations were significantly lower in the hippocampus of AD patients
compared with control subjects of comparable age,
(2) MRI-measured hippocampal volume was also
lower in AD patients compared with control subjects,
(3) reductions of atrophy-corrected hippocampal
NAA were not an artifact of partial volume effects,
and (4)reductions of hippocampal NAA and volume
losses provided independent information regarding
the discrimination of AD from control subjects, and
when used together classified AD better than either
measure alone. In conclusion, these findings suggest
that measurement of hippocampal NAA by ‘H MRSI,
when employed in conjunction with MRI, may provide improved discrimination between AD patients
and control subjects, and ultimately may be useful to
detect AD in the early stages of the disease.
The first major finding of this study was that NAA
was reduced in the hippocampus of AD patients compared with control subjects of comparable age. This
result is consistent with a previous ‘H MRSI study
in the hippocampus of AD patientsL1that measured
reduced hippocampal NAAlCho and NAAlCr, suggesting diminished NAA levels. However, the
present experiment quantitatively measured absolute NAA in hippocampus and, furthermore, combined NAA and volume measurements to improve
discrimination between AD patients and normal elderly. There is a considerable body of evidence concerning reduced NAA in the brain of AD patients.
Kwo-On-Yuen et al.,”’ performing in vitro NMR measurements of AD brain tissue a t post mortem demonstrated reduced NAA, consistent with neuron loss.
Since then there have been several reports, including
those from this l a b ~ r a t o r y , ~
indicating
,~
reduced
NAAlCr andfor NAAlCho in AD, and a few quantitative ‘H MRS measurements documenting unambiguously lower NAA in A D . ” ’ ” Reports of reduced
metabolite ratios have inferred that the reductions of
NAAlCr and N M C h o cannot simply be attributed to
volume loss, because simple atrophy would result in
reductions of both NAA as well as Cho and Cr. Most
previous single-volume ‘H MRS and ‘H MRSI studies of AD have been performed in supraventricular
brain regions involving frontal, parietal, and occipital cortex, and white matter. These studies did not
include hippocampus, even though it is a major site
of AD pathology, including neuron loss specifically:”
This is probably because technical problems, including difficulties in obtaining sufficient homogeneity of
the local static magnetic field and contamination
from lipid resonances have complicated acquisition of
spectra from medial temporal lobe and hippocampal
regions. Our previous experience obtaining ‘H MRSI
spectra from the hippocampal regions in patients

with temporal lobe epilepsyI8 indicated t h a t 'H
MRSI of the hippocampus was feasible.
The second major finding of this report is that
hippocampal volumes were reduced in AD patients
compared with control subjects of comparable age.
This finding is similar to several previous MRI reports, which have shown volume reductions in AD
patients up to 48%' when compared with normal
elderly. In contrast to the initial MRI studies of hippocampal atrophy, which reported a complete separation between AD patients and control subjects,'
the present results are similar to those of
which found considerable overlap. One possible explanation for this overlap is that neuron loss in the
hippocampus of AD patients is accompanied by reactive gliosis, ' j which attenuates tissue atrophy, resulting in an underestimation of volume loss by MRI
and consequently in the failure to discriminate between AD patients and normal elderly.
The third major finding of this study is that reductions of hippocampal NAA corrected for atrophy are
not an artifact of differences in tissue composition of
the MRSI voxels between groups. In an earlier study
MacKay et al.") from this laboratory, using a combined analysis of coregistered MRI and 'H MRSI
data, demonstrated that NAA differences measured
111 supraventricular regions of AD patients and control subjects existed independent of variations of the
tissue characteristic in MRSI voxels. The current results demonstrate that this observation can be extended to the hippocampus. The current analysis
was made possible by the development of semiautomated segmentation and voluming software with accurate coregistration of the MRI and 'H MRSI data.
There have been few attempt^'^ I5 to measure quantitatively metabolic changes by 'H MRSI with consideration of partial volume effects. Aside from the
previous report by MacKay et al.,'" there have been
no attempts to determine statistically the extent to
which metabolic changes in AD are independent
from variations of the tissue characteristic in MRSI
voxels.
The most important finding of this study is that
hippocampal NAA and volume provide independent
information regarding the discrimination between
AD patients and normal elderly. This result led us to
attempt to use both measures to improve discrimination between AD patients and control subjects. Figure 3 depicts the distribution of hippocampal NAA as
a function of hippocampal volume from each subject
and demonstrates that the combination of the two
measures provided better correct classification of AD
patients and control subjects in this study population
than either measure alone. However, this result does
not imply clinical applications for the diagnosis of
AD. Further studies on a larger population, especially with unselected subjects, are necessary to assess the diagnostic value of the NAA X volume index
in comparison with that available with current clinical methods. In a strict sense, this can be achieved
only with longitudinal studies that culminate in the

pathologic confirmation of AD in each patient. Figure 3 also shows an overlap between patients and
control subjects for both hippocampal NAA and volume measures. There are several explanations for
this finding. Increasing neurofibrillary tangle burdenj6 and neuronal lossj7 with age are commonly
found in hippocampal regions of nondemented elderly individuals, which could explain the low NAA
levels and small hippocampi of some control subjects.
Another explanation for the overlap includes the possibility that the control group may have included
individuals with preclinical AD, Finally, the lack of a
complete separation between AD patients and control subjects could also be interpreted in the sense of
a neurobiological continuum between norm a1 aging
and dementia, a view supported by findings of several recent ~ t u d i e s . ' ~Nevertheless,
"~
the finding of
this study that hippocampal NAA and volume provide independent information regarding the discrimination between AD patients and control subjects
supports our hypothesis that 'H MRSI in conibination with MRI may be helpful in providing improved
diagnosis and early detection of AD.
There are several limitations to this study. First,
the AD patients have not yet been followed to autopsy, so it is not absolutely certain that the patients
have AD. Second, data from elderly patients with
dementias due to causes other than AD (such as
vascular dementia) were not included. Therefore, it
is not clear whether the reduction of hippocampal
NAA found in AD is specific for this condition. However, previous 'H MRSI studies in AD and in vascular dementia found metabolic abnormalities in WM
regions of vascular dementia but not in AD,HI', raising the possibility that 'H MRSI may be useful to
distinguish between these two forms of dementia.
Third, the major technical limitation of this study
was that the spatial resolution of 'H MRSI is coarse,
and nonhippocampal structures were probably included within the MRSI voxel, especially other structures in the limbic lobe. However, these structures
are also involved with AD. Furthermore this '13
MRSI study was restricted to the hippocampal region and did not obtain MR spectra from other areas
of the brain, including the frontal, parietal, and temporal cortices, which are also affected by AD. Greater
brain coverage can be accomplished by using multislice 'H MRSI"" instead of volume preselection methods as applied in this study. Recently, Tedeschi et
al.17 employed multislice 'H MRSI to measure metabolite ratios from large sections of frontal, parietal,
and temporal lobes and thalamus in AD, but not
from mesial temporal lobe and hippocampus. This
laboratory has also developed a version of multislice
'H MRS14" that should be useful for the assessment
of AD.
Fourth, increased levels of myoinositol inversely
correlated with NAA changes have been rcbported in
AD using single 'H MRS a t relatively short spinecho times (TE <30 ms).41The current study was
performed a t TE = 135 ms and does not permit the

detection of resonances from myoinositol, which exhibits T2 values in the order of 60 m s or less.”
Development of multislice ’H MRSI with short spinecho times to accommodate simultaneous measurements of NAA, myoinositol, and other metabolites
are currently under development. Finally, we did not
attempt to measure metabolite relaxation times T 1
and T2 because of the prohibitively long duration of
the data acquisition. Instead, we used T1 and T2
values for NAA, Cr, and Cho documented in a previous report of MRS in healthy elderly” and applied
these values to obtain approximations for t h e metabolite concentrations in AD patients and control subjects. This analysis is limited in that it ignores the
possibility of T 1 and T2 alterations with regions
and/or disease. To our knowledge, there is no evidence of abnormal T 1 values in AD. Christiansen et
al.I3 using single-volume MRS, reported prolonged
T2 times for NAA in frontal WM of AD subjects
compared with control subjects. If T2 for NAA was
also prolonged in the hippocampus, the current measurements would have overestimated NAA in AD,
and thus underestimated the differences with control
subjects.
In conclusion, this report demonstrates reductions
of volume-corrected NAA, a measure of neuronal
density, in the hippocampus of patients with AD
compared with control subjects of comparable age.
These NAA reductions are statistically independent
from hippocampal volume losses, and NAA taken together with volume provides better discrimination
between AD patients and control subjects than either measure alone. These findings suggest t h a t
measurement of NAA by ‘H MRSI provides complementary information about loss or damage of neurons in AD t h a t is not available from measurements
of atrophy by MRI. Ultimately, ‘H MRSI together
with MRI may be helpful in providing improved diagnosis and early detection of AD.

An alphabetical ‘WORLD’
A new version of an old test
Norman A. Leopold, DO; and Andrew J. Borson, PhD

Article abstract-The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a standardized test used by neurologists 1.0 screen
patients for impaired cognition. Despite its ease of use, one major limitation of t h e MMSE is a possible ceiling et‘fect or a
lower sensitivity in patients with advanced education. Patients ( n = 97) undergoing diagnostic neuropsychologicd testing
also completed one subtest of the MMSE, the spelling of “world.” I n addition to its forward and backward spelling, patients
were asked to reorder these letters in alphabetical sequence. Our preliminary data indicate that our modified WORLD test
is a rapid and simple test to identify patients with cognitive impairment. When measured against the diagnosis of
dementia as determined by neuropsychological testing, t h e modified WORLD test has a sensitivity of 85%, a specificity of
88%, and a positive predictability value of 95%. Other variables examined include patient age, sex, education, and cutoff
scores on the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale.

The Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) is a
standard tool used by neurologists in clinical practice
to rapidly detect cognitive impairment.’ This test is a
series of tasks that assess orientation, immediate
and short-term recall, attention and calculation, language, and visual construction. The MMSE examines
attention by asking patients to subtract serial 7’s o r
spell “world” backwards. Both tasks have high diagnostic sensitivity but low specificity. The WORLD
subtest is often favored because it de-emphasizes
mathematical skills.
The major limitation of the WORLD test is a possible ceiling effect or a lower sensitivity in patients
with advanced education. Improved sensitivity and
specificity can be achieved by using more sophisticated neuropsychological tests (e.g., Wisconsin Card

Sorting test),’ but their methodologic or scoring complexities render them impractical as bedside screening procedures. To improve the accuracy of bedside
cognitive testing, we modified the standard WORLD
test by asking patients to reorder the letters in
“world in alphabetical sequence. We present the results of a pilot study to determine the validity of this
simple and rapid test as a potential marker of cognitive dysfunction.
Methods. Consecutive physician-referred patients ( n 97) undergoing neuropsychological evaluation for possible
dementia or depression completed a series of standitid
tests administered by one author (A.J.B.). These tests included the Mattis Dementia Rating Scale (DRS),< Boston
