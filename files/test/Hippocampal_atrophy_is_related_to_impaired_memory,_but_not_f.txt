WE investigated the neuropsychological correlates of
hippocampal atrophy in Parkinson’s disease (PD)
patients. The memory impaired PD patients had smaller
hippocampi than other PD patients. The performance of
PD patients in spatial working memory and attentional
set-shifting correlated with the severity of motor defect,
and not with hippocampal atrophy. Our results suggests
that failure of verbal/visual memory may be related to
hippocampal atrophy in Parkinson’s disease. On the
contrast, the defect in spatial working memory and
attentional set-shifting may be sensitive to dysfunction
of ‘fronto-striatal’ systems in PD patients NeuroReport

Introduction
Parkinson’s disease (PD) even at an early stage
impairs performance in tests measuring functions
mediated by the ‘fronto-striatal’ systems, such as
spatial working memory (SWM) and attentional setshifting.1–3 This impairment may reflect the severity
of striatal dopaminergic loss2,3 and impaired functions
of ‘fronto-striatal’ loops.4 However, in PD the
frontal dopamine projections are also adversely
affected,5 suggesting that the progressive dysfunction
of striatal and frontal dopamine transmission may
both contribute for the impaired performance in
‘frontal’ tests.2 It is relevant to note that more
severely disabled PD patients are also less accurate
in tests sensitive to dysfunction of hippocampus and
anatomically related medial temporal lobe cortical
structures, such as delayed matching to sample test
(DMTS).3 Dopaminergic defect may not contribute
for impaired DMTS memory accuracy, since L-dopa
withdrawal did not further aggravate DMTS defect
in PD patients.3
We designed the present study to investigate the
hypothesis that impaired declarative memory performance in non-demented PD patients is associated
with hippocampal atrophy6,7 and that hippocampal

atrophy is not related to the degree of ‘fronto-striatal’
cognitive defects. Therefore, we compared the
volumes of hippocampi of PD patients that had intact
or impaired memory performance in two tests that
are sensitive to dysfunction of the medial temporal
lobe memory systems, DMTS and primacy component of the list learning test.8 To study the selectivity
of the association between hippocampal atrophy and
impaired performance in DMTS and list learning
tests, we also measured spatial working memory and
attentional set-shifting functions of these patients.

Patients and Methods
We included 43 non-demented9 patients with a
diagnosis of idiopathic PD in the study (Table 1).
All exhibited a typical akinetic rigid syndrome with
rest tremor. The patients were rated while on
dopaminergic medication (L-dopa in combination
with peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor).10 Twenty
patients were rated I–II (mild PD group) and 23
patients were rated III–IV (severe PD group). None
of the patients showed clinical signs of depression
(Geriatric Depression scale; GDS), dementia, psychosis or focal cortical pathology. All of the study
patients had received dopaminergic medication and

had shown adequate clinical anti-parkinsonian
response. The PD patients were on optimal dopaminergic medication during testing that had been stable
for at least 2 months. No subjects received anticholinergic medication during the study period or for
12 months before the initiation of the study. In addition to cognitive testing and routine clinical MRI
analysis, the investigation of the subjects included
clinical neurological examination and laboratory tests
to exclude medical conditions that could impair cognitive functioning.
Cognitive testing included computerized neuropsychological tests (SWM, intra- dimensional/extra
dimensional (ID/ED) attentional set shifting, DMTS,
motor screening).11 A computerized system with a
touch sensitive video screen was used. These tests
provide non-verbal stimuli and record responses
using the touch sensitive screen. The subjects were
first familiarized with the testing procedure by letting
them perform a motor screening task in which they
were trained to point accurately at the screen. A standard ‘paper and pencil’ word list learning test was
alsi assessed. SWM12 is a self ordered test of working
memory, which also incorporates a strategic search
component to tax central executive function. Subjects
had to search through a number of boxes (four, six
or eight) tor a hidden token without returning to a
box which they had already examined on the same
trial (to avoid within-search errors) or which had
already contained a token on the previous trial (to
avoid between-search errors). Tokens were hidden
one at a time, and were never hidden in the same box
twice. The main measure of this test was betweensearch errors at each level of the test, as this has been
shown to separate mild and severe PD patients.
ID/ED13 is a test of attentional set-shifting based
in part on the Wisconsin card sort test (WCST).
There are nine stages in which a subject has to learn
a visual discrimination to criterion (six consecutive
trials correct). The first two stages required a simple
1508 Vol 9 No 7 11 May 1998

visual discrimination (SD), followed by a reversal
of this discrimination upon reaching criterion
(SDR). Another visual dimension is then introduced
which the subject must learn is irrelevant (compound
discrimination with stimuli separated (C–D) or
superimposed (CD)), even in the face of a reversal of
the original discrimination (compound discrimination
reversal; CDR). An intra-dimensional shift is then
introduced, at which point new exemplars of the two
dimensions are given, and the subject must now learn
a new discrimination to criterion (intra-dimensional
shift; IDS) followed by a reversal of this rule (intradimensional reversal; IDR). The penultimate stage of
the test introduces an extra-dimensional shift (EDS),
where again new exemplars of the two dimensions
are presented, but this time the subject must shift
his or her attention to the dimension which was
previously irrelevant (EDS), followed finally by a
reversal of this rule (extra-dimensional reversal;
EDR). The EDS is akin to a category shift in the
WCST. For each stage of the test, the main measure
was the stage successfully attainted. The main
measures were the IDR and EDS stages that cannot
and can separate, respectively, the performance accuracy of mild and severe PD patients.
Visual memory was tested with the DMTS.14 In
the DMTS, the subject must match patterns in either
a delayed or simultaneous condition. In the simultaneous condition the sample and all of the choice
stimuli are present on the screen simultaneously, and
the subject must select the choice pattern that matches
the sample exactly. In the final condition there are
delays of 1, 4, 8 and 16 s between the 40 presentations of the sample pattern and the choice stimuli.
The subjects must touch the choice stimulus that
exactly matches the sample. If the first response is
incorrect, the subject may choose again until the
correct answer is reached or all choice stimuli have
been selected. There are three practice trials, and then
40 test trials during which delay condition (0, 4, 8 or

16 s delay) are counterbalanced. A short break is
allowed after 20 test trials. To discourage subjects
from encoding the sample pattern on the basis of one
quadrant only, all four choice patterns have one
quadrant in common with the sample. The outcome
measure is the percentage of correct responses at
different delays.
Verbal memory was measured with a list learning
test. The list learning test consisted of a nine-word
list that was read aloud to patients three times.
Immediately after the tester had finished reading the
words, the patient repeated as many words as possible
(immediate recall). This was repeated three times and
a maximum correct score was 27 (9 words ´ 3 repetitions = 27 words). The patient was asked to again
repeat the words 6 min later (delayed recall,
maximum correct score nine words). During this
break other cognitive tests were assessed. The number
of total correct and false words was measured.
Furthermore the word list was divided into three
parts to study the serial position effect (primacy
words 1–3; intermediate words 4–6 and recency
words 7–9) and to examine in detail what component of word list learning is affected by PD.
The subjects were scanned with a 1.5 T Magnetom
(Siemens, Erlagen, Germany) using a standard head
coil and coronal 3D gradient echo sequence (MPRAGE: TR 10sms, TE 4 ms, TI 250 ms, flip angle
120°, FOV 250 mm, matrix 256 ´ 192, one acquisition).8 This resulted in 128 T1-weighted partitions
with slice thickness of 1.5–1.8 mm. The partitions
covering the hippocampus were reformatted into
1 mm contiguous slices perpendicular to the long axis
of the hippocampus. The term hippocampus included
the dentate gyrus, the hippocampus proper and the
subicular complex. The uncal portion of the rostral
hippocampus that is located ventral to the caudal
amygdala was included into the hippocampus. The
caudal end of the hippocampus was determined from
the section in which the fornices were still detectable
in their full length. The fornices were not, however
included in the volume of the hippocampus. We used
standard anatomical atlases of the human brain as
guidelines to determine the boundaries of the amygdala auld hippocampus on oblique coronal MRI
sections. The boundaries of the region of interest
were outlined by a trackball-driven cursor. The
number of voxels within the region was integrated
by using a program developed in-house for standard
work console. Every second 1 mm slice was included
in the analysis, which reduced the number of slices
to 20–23 for hippocampus. We calculated the results
using normalized volumes of the amygdala and
hippocampus (volume of the hippocampus/the area
of both hemispheres in MRI taken at the level of the
anterior commissure).

The group and task difficulty effects and group ´
difficulty interaction were analyzed with repeated
measures ANOVA. The t-test, one-way ANOVA
and Bonferroni post hoc test, x2 and Wilcoxon signed
ranks tests were used.

Results
Eight PD patients performed > 1 s.d. below the mean
of all the patients at the longest delay of DMTS test
and at the primacy component of the list learning
test measured after a 6 min forgetting interval. These
patients were called memory impaired (MI) PD
patients and all of them were suffering from severe
PD (III–IV). The rest of the patients (n = 35) were
called memory unimpaired (MU) PD patients (20
mild PD: I–II; 17 severe P; Fig. 1A,B).
The performance of MI PD patients was at long
delays impaired compared with the MU PD patients
(delay ´ group interaction: F(1.41) = 12.1, p < 0.001;
Fig. 1A). The MI PD group was not impaired at
simultaneous matching, or at a 0 or 4 s delay
(p > 0.1) but they scored less well at 8 and 16 s delays
(p < 0.001). In the list learning test, MI PD patients
after 6 min forgetting interval recalled fewer primacy
words (p < 0.001), but were as accurate as the MU
PD patients in recalling intermediate and recency
words (p > 0.1, for both; Fig. 1B).
The number of between-search errors at the level
of 6 and 8 boxes did not differ between the MI and
MU PD patients (group: F(1.41) = 1.0, p > 0.1; difficulty: F(1,41) = 95.1, p < 0.001; group ´ difficulty:
F(1.41) = 3.3, p = 0.08; Table 2). Furthermore, the
number of MU and MI PD groups that reached IDR,
EDS or EDR stages did not differ (x2 > 1.0, p > 0.1;
for all).
We also compared the performance of severe and
mild PD patients in SWM and ID/ED tests. The
severe PD group was impaired at the arduous 8
box level of SWM test compared with the mild PD
(20 MU patients) group (group: F(1,41) = 2.8, p = 1.0;
difficulty: F(1,41) = 139.8, p < 0.001; group ´ difficulty: F(1,41) = 11.8, p < 0.001; Table 2). The ID/ED
set-shifting performance of the mild and severe PD
was as accurate at easy IDR level (x2 = 0.15, p > 0.1),
but the proportion of the severe PD patients that
solved the difficult EDR and EDS levels was lower
(x2 = 10, p < 0.01; for both). Importantly, comparison
of the MU and MI severe PD patients showed no
difference in SWM (group: F(1,21) = 3.3, p = 0.5;
difficulty: F(1,21 = 91.4, p < 0.001; group ´ difficulty:
F(1,21) = 0.18, p > 0.1) or attentional set-shifting
performance (IDR, EDS, EDR stages: p > 0.1 for all).
The MU and MI severe PD patients were older,
had suffered from the disease for a longer period
and had higher GDS scores than mild PD patients

between the mild and severe PD groups (F(2,40) < 1,
p > 0.1 for both comparisons).
The normalized right and left hippocampal volumes of the MI severe PD group were smaller than
those of the MU mild or severe PD patients (F(1.42)
> 5.9, p < 0.019 for both comparisons; p < 0.05 vs
the other two groups of PD patients; Table 1). The
volume of right and left hippocamppi correlated with
DMTS accuracy at 16 s delay (r > 0.7, p < 0.001 for
both analyses), but not at shorter delays (r < 0.2.
p > 0.1 for all). Hippocampal volume correlated
nearly significantly with recall of primacy words after
the 6 min forgetting interval (r = 0.26, p = 0.088).
Hippocampal volumes, and DMTS or list learning
accuracy did not correlate with measures of SWM or
ID/ED set shifting tests, age, disease duration, dose of
dopaminergic medication and GDS scoring (r < 0.15,
p > 0.05 for all analyses).

Hippocampal atrophy correlated with impaired
memory scoring in PD patients. We also confirmed
previous evidence suggesting that dopaminergic dysfunction may cause impaired SWM and attentional
set-shifting accuracy, as the severity of motor symptoms correlated with these fronto-striatal functions.2,3
Previous clinical and experimental results support
our finding that impaired memory performance in
DMTS and list learning tests in PD patients is at least
partly due to hippocampal dysfunction. First, humans
may employ verbal strategies to perform in the
DMTS test and actually form associations between
verbal cues and the sample figures employing a paired
associates learning strategy that requires hippocampal
processing.15,16 Second, a supra-span list learning
test and recall of these memory items after a delay
filled with distracting activity (other cognitive tests)
depends on hippocampal processing.8 Indeed, surgical
excision of the medial temporal lobe structures
during epilepsy surgery17 and neurodegeneration in
Alzheimer’s disease18 disrupts list learning and
impairs the ability to retrieve the words from the
beginning of the list.8,19 However, the defective
DMTS and word list test scoring may not be only
due to degeneration of the hippocampus, as several
neurotransmitter systems are affected during the
progression of PD.5 For example, dysfunction of
cholinergic cells of the basal forebrain or noradrenergic locus coeruleus may impair attention and certain
forms of declarative memory functions in more
advanced PD patients.5
Some non-specific factor, such as disease duration,
depression, medication or age is unlikely to explain
the inferior delayed memory performance, as the MI
severe PD patients did not differ in these measures

from the MU severe PD patient. Furthermore, no
correlation was observed between depression scoring,
dopaminergic medication, disease duration or age and
memory performance.
In conclusion, our present data described that
some PD patients that suffered from a severe motor
disability also had a delay-dependent visual and
verbal memory failure that was associated with mild
atrophy of the hippocampus. On the contrary, the
defect in fronto-striatal measures did not correlate
with the hippocampal atrophy, but was related to the
severity of motor dysfunction. This and earlier
evidence suggests that the dopamine cell loss in the
midbrain contributes for the defect in fronto-striatal
functions in PD patients. Furthermore, failure of
memory retention occurs less frequently in PD
patients and this is at least to some extent due to
hippocampal dysfunction.

Conclusion
Parkinson’s disease is characterized by impaired
function of fronto-striatal loops that results from
loss of dopaminergic cells in the substantia nigra.
Impaired activity of the fronto-striatal systems
disrupts spatial working memory, planning and attentional set-shifting at an early stage of the disease.
However, some PD patients suffer from a retention

delay-dependent impairment (i.e. the longer the delay
is, the worse memory) of memory that is not likely
to result from dopaminergic dysfunction. Our results
found that the severity of hippocampal atrophy
correlated with impaired memory accuracy in PD
patients.
