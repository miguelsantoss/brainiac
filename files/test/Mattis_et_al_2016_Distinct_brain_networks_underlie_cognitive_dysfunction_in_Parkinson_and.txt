ABSTRACT

Objective: To determine whether cognitive impairment in Parkinson disease (PD) and Alzheimer
disease (AD) derives from the same network pathology.

Methods: We analyzed 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scans from 40 patients with AD and 40 agematched healthy controls from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and scanned an
additional 10 patients with AD and 10 healthy controls at The Feinstein Institute for Medical
Research to derive an AD-related metabolic pattern (ADRP) analogous to our previously established PD cognition-related pattern (PDCP) and PD motor-related pattern (PDRP). We computed
individual subject expression values for ADRP and PDCP in 89 patients with PD and correlated
summary scores for cognitive functioning with network expression. We also evaluated changes in
ADRP and PDCP expression in a separate group of 15 patients with PD scanned serially over a 4year period.

Results: Analysis revealed a significant AD-related metabolic topography characterized by covarying metabolic reductions in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and parietal and temporal association regions. Expression of ADRP, but not PDCP, was elevated in both AD groups and
correlated with worse cognitive summary scores. Patients with PD showed slight ADRP expression, due to topographic overlap with the network underlying PD motor-related pattern degeneration, but only their PDCP expression values increased as cognitive function and executive
performance declined. Longitudinal data in PD disclosed an analogous dissociation of network
expression.
Conclusions: Cognitive dysfunction in PD is associated with a specific brain network that is
largely spatially and functionally distinct from that seen in relation to AD. Neurology®

Cognitive impairment is commonly observed in patients with Parkinson disease (PD), even early
in the clinical course,1,2 but its cause remains unclear. The postmortem observation of
amyloid-b plaques and tau neurofibrilliary tangles, pathologic hallmarks of Alzheimer disease
(AD), in individuals with PD and dementia has led to the hypothesis that the cognitive changes
in PD are caused by comorbid AD.3–5 Many patients with PD have substantial cognitive loss
without forming plaques and tangles, however, and the severity of neuropsychological deficits in
patients with PD with coexisting cortical Lewy body and AD-like pathology correlates only with

the former.6 Whether AD contributes to the
cognitive deficits in PD thus remains an unsettled question.
The fact that neuronal dysfunction in neurodegenerative diseases is propagated along
discrete networks makes such questions amenable to neuroimaging approaches. We and
others have used 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose
(FDG)–PET and fMRI to identify diseasespecific networks in PD, AD, Huntington disease, and other conditions.7–13 We have shown
that akinesia-rigidity in PD correlates with the
expression of a PD motor-related pattern
(PDRP)10,11 such that more severe symptoms
are reflected in higher PDRP scores; tremor is
mediated by a distinct cerebello-thalamocortical network14; and the expression of a distinct PD cognition-related pattern (PDCP),
characterized by diminished metabolism in
the medial frontal and parietal regions, rises
as cognitive function deteriorates.15–18 Similarly, in AD, neuropsychological test performance correlates with the expression of an
AD-related pattern (ADRP) characterized by
covarying reductions in hippocampal, superior
temporal, and parieto-occipital resting-state
activity.7 To determine whether patients with
PD, with or without cognitive deficits, express
ADRP, we compared ADRP and PDCP
expression in patients with AD and those with
PD. We also analyzed changes in ADRP and
PDCP over time in a separate longitudinal
cohort of patients with PD.
METHODS Participants. Patients with AD. To ensure the
most rigorous comparison, we used the same spatial covariance
analysis approach we previously used to characterize PDRP10,19
to identify and validate a reliable ADRP topography for prospective use. We analyzed metabolic images from 40 patients with AD
(23 men and 17 women, mean 6 SD age 75.9 6 5.6 years,
Mini-Mental State Examination [MMSE] score 22.6 6 3.3)
and 40 age-matched healthy controls (23 men and 17 women,
age 76.0 6 4.7 years) who had been scanned with FDG-PET as
part of the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI;
see table e-1 at Neurology.org for demographic and neuropsychological data).
Using a random number generator (http://www.r-project.
org/), we assigned the patients with AD and controls to 1 of 2
groups. The first group comprised 20 patients with AD (AD1; 13
men and 7 women, age 76.0 6 6.2 years, MMSE score 23.6 6
2.4) and 20 normal controls (NL1; 10 men and 10 women, age
76.6 6 5.2 years). We used scans from these AD1 and NL1
participants to identify a significant ADRP topography and scans
from a second group of 20 patients with AD (AD2; 10 men and
10 women, age 75.8 6 5.2 years, MMSE score 21.6 6 3.8) and
20 normal controls (NL2; 13 men and 7 women, age 75.5 6 4.2

years) for testing. A third group constituting an additional validation set, consisting of 10 additional patients with AD (AD3; 6
men and 4 women, age 74.5 6 5.3 years, MMSE score 23.9 6
4.2) and 10 age-matched healthy volunteers (NL3; 4 men and 6
women, age 73.4 6 4.8 years), were scanned with FDG-PET on
the GE Advance tomograph (General Electric, Milwaukee, WI)
at The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research (FIMR; Manhasset, NY) as described elsewhere.19,20 One of the investigators
(M.L.G.) made the diagnosis of AD in the AD3 cohort on the
basis of published criteria.21
Patients with PD. We quantified ADRP expression values
and subject scores for the previously characterized PDCP network
topography in a cross-sectional sample of 89 patients (61 men and
28 women, age 61.6 6 9.0 years, MMSE score 28.0 6 2.3) who
were recruited at the Movement Disorders Center of Northwell
Health (Great Neck, NY) and diagnosed according to the UK
Brain Bank criteria for idiopathic PD.22 These patients had pure
parkinsonism without a history of known causative factors (such
as encephalitis or neuroleptic treatment and without supranuclear
gaze abnormalities or ataxia); patients with Lewy body dementia
were excluded. Table e-2 summarizes the demographic and
neuropsychological data for these participants.
We classified patients with PD as having dementia or not having dementia according to the Dementia Rating Scale23: 11 had
scores ,127, classifying them as having PD dementia (PDD); the
remaining 78 were classified as not having dementia. Using the
neuropsychological battery (see e-Methods), we assigned patients
with PD without dementia to 3 previously defined cognitive
categories: cognitively intact [PD-MCI(2); n 5 18], mild cognitive impairment (MCI) involving a single cognitive domain
[PD-MCI(s); n 5 30], and MCI involving multiple cognitive
domains [PD-MCI(m); n 5 30]. The neuropsychological testing
criteria for MCI in patients with PD are described elsewhere.2,18
In addition, we compared the progression of ADRP and
PDCP in a previously published longitudinal imaging cohort of
15 patients with PD (11 men and 4 women, age 58.0 6 10.2
years) who were scanned with FDG-PET at baseline (within 2
years of diagnosis) and again 24 and 48 months later.24 All participants in the cross-sectional and longitudinal PD cohorts
underwent FDG-PET at FIMR according to the same protocol
used for the AD3 group.

Standard protocol approvals, registrations, and patient
consents. For the patients with AD and healthy volunteers participating in ADNI protocols, written informed consent was
obtained after approval was granted by the Institutional Review
Board of the collaborating institutions. For participants scanned
at FIMR, we obtained ethics permission from the Institutional
Review Board of Northwell Health and written consent from
each participant after a detailed explanation of the procedures.

Image analysis. FDG-PET scans were preprocessed with SPM5
(Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging, Institute of
Neurology, London, UK) running on Matlab 6.0 (Mathworks
Inc, Natick, MA). Scans were spatially normalized to a standard
PET brain template and smoothed with a 3-dimensional
gaussian kernel (full width at half maximum 5 10 mm).
Spatial covariance analysis10,19,20 identified a distinct ADRP
topography in the combined AD1 (n 5 20) and NL1 (n 5 20)
ADNI derivation sample. (The computational procedures used to
identify and validate this pattern are detailed in e-Methods.) We
computed ADRP expression values (subject scores) for each
member of the ADNI (AD2/NL2, n 5 40) and FIMR (AD3/
NL3, n 5 20; PD, n 5 89) testing samples using an automated
algorithm available at http://www.feinsteinneuroscience.org. The
resulting measures were z scored with respect to corresponding

measures from the NL1 normal reference sample used in pattern
identification. We used analogous procedures to quantify PDCP
expression in the same scans in each of the testing cases. To
accord with previously published results, PDCP expression values
were z scored with respect to values from the group of normal
controls (NL4; 8 men and 7 women, age 56.7 6 12.3 years) used
for reference in prior studies.18,25,26

Network correlates of neuropsychological test performance.
We evaluated the relationship between network expression and cognitive performance in the combined ADNI (AD1/AD2) patient
cohort and the FIMR PD sample. For the ADNI participants, we
used the summary score data for memory and executive functioning
provided in the database.27 Because the ADNI database does not
provide a summary score for language function, we constructed
a language index score based on the measures that were available
for each participant, standardized (z scored) with respect to agecorrected normative values, and averaged individual scores to form
a language summary index. We used a similar approach to compute
summary scores for memory, executive function, and language in
members of the cross-sectional PD sample.

Data analysis. We assessed differences in ADRP expression
between patients with AD and controls separately for the ADNI
(AD2/NL2) and FIMR (AD3/NL3) testing sets and for the PD
and age-matched normal reference (NL4) groups scanned at
FIMR. Subject scores computed in each of the subgroups
within this PD sample, PD-MCI(2), PD-MCI(s), PD-MCI
(m), and PDD, were separately compared to corresponding
control values. Differences in ADRP expression between
patients and controls in each testing sample were assessed with
Student t tests, and differences in ADRP expression across the PD
subgroups were assessed with 1-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA), followed by post-hoc Dunnett tests for multiple
comparisons. We used identical statistical procedures to assess
group differences in PDCP expression in each testing sample.
Potential network 3 subgroup interaction effects in the PD
data were evaluated with 2-way repeated-measures ANOVA
(RMANOVA), with network as the within-subject variable and
subgroup as the between-subject variable.
We used a similar approach to evaluate the neuropsychological summary scores for the 2 disease groups. We constructed separate 1-way ANOVA models for each cognitive domain to
identify differences across the PD subgroups; p values were
adjusted for multiple comparisons with the Dunnett correction.
Relationships between individual subject ADRP and PDCP
expression values and the neuropsychological summary scores
were evaluated separately in the AD and PD groups by calculating
the Pearson product-moment correlations.
To compare changes in ADRP and PDCP expression over
time in the longitudinal PD cohort, we analyzed the subject
scores using 2-way RMANOVA with network and time as
within-subject variables. If a significant network 3 time interaction effect was evident in the data, we used 1-way RMANOVA to
assess changes over time in the expression of each network. All
statistical analyses were performed with SAS 9.3 for Windows
(SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC) and considered significant at
p , 0.05 (2-tailed).
RESULTS ADRP, but not PDCP, expression was

consistently elevated in patients with AD. Spatial covariance analysis of metabolic scans from the combined
AD1/NL1 derivation sample revealed a distinct
ADRP topography characterized by metabolic reductions in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus,

and temporal and parietal association regions, along
with an increase in activity in the sensorimotor cortex
and cerebellum (figure 1A, top and table). The voxel
weights on the pattern, reflecting local contributions
to overall network activity, were found to be stable by
bootstrap estimation (absolute value of the inverse
coefficient of variation range 5 [22.822 to 2.814],
p , 0.005, 1,000 iterations). The ADRP was topographically unrelated to the PDCP (r2 5 0.013, voxel
weight correlation, figure 1B, top). It is worth noting
that the ADRP exhibited some correlation with
the PDRP, although the relationship did not reach
significance (r2 5 0.123, voxel-weight correlation);
there are shared regional metabolic reductions
involving the inferior parietal lobule bilaterally,
which are more salient for ADRP than PDRP11 (see
e-Methods). ADRP subject scores (figure 1A,
bottom), which measure pattern expression in
individual cases, were consistently elevated in
patients with AD relative to their healthy
counterparts (p , 0.0003, permutation test).
For validation, we used an automated algorithm to
quantify ADRP expression in the ADNI (AD2 and
NL2) and FIMR (AD3 and NL3) testing sets on a prospective single-scan basis. As in the derivation sample,
ADRP subject scores (figure 1A, bottom) were markedly elevated in patients relative to controls in both
AD testing sets (AD2, p , 0.0001; AD3, p , 0.004,
Student t tests). In contrast to the ADRP, expression
values for the PDCP (figure 1B, bottom) did not differ
from normal in the derivation set (p 5 0.74) or in
either of the testing sets (AD2, p 5 0.14; AD3, p 5
0.63). There was no discernible correlation between
ADRP and PDCP expression values in the AD patient
sample (p . 0.34) or between ADRP or PDCP
expression and subject age (p . 0.18).
In patients with AD, neuropsychological scores correlated
with ADRP but not PDCP expression levels. We used

the summary score data for memory, language, and
executive functioning provided by the ADNI database,27 which included data from a variety of measures, depending on which tests were administered
(e-Methods). Summary scores for each of the 3 cognitive domains correlated with ADRP expression in the
combined AD cohorts: the worse the summary score,
the more elevated the expression of ADRP (memory:
r 5 20.32, p , 0.05; language: r 5 20.45, p ,
0.004; executive function: r 5 20.34, p , 0.03,
Pearson correlations, figure 2, left). There was no such
correlation between neuropsychological summary scores
and PDCP expression (p . 0.12, figure 2, right).
Cognitive impairment in patients with PD correlates
with expression of PDCP but not ADRP. As expected,18

the PD cohort showed PDCP expression (p ,
0.0005) that increased as cognitive impairment

(A) Top, ADRP, identified by spatial covariance analysis of 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose–PET scans of 20 patients with AD (AD1) and 20 normal controls (NL1)
from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), was characterized by reduced activity in the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and parietal
and temporal association regions, with relative increases in the cerebellum, sensorimotor cortex, and supplementary motor area (represented by the second
principal component, which accounted for 12.8% of the subject 3 voxel variation in the data). Voxel weights on the pattern, reflecting local contributions to
overall network activity, were found to be stable by bootstrap estimation (absolute value of the inverse coefficient of variation range 5 [22.822 to 2.814],
p , 0.005, 1,000 iterations). Bottom, In the derivation sample, which comprised 20 patients with AD (AD1) and 20 normal controls (NL1) selected randomly
from the ADNI database (see supplemental data), ADRP expression values (subject scores) accurately discriminated patients from healthy controls (p ,
0.0003, permutation test). Prospectively computed ADRP subject scores achieved comparable group separation (p , 0.004, Student t test) in 2 separate
testing samples. The first testing set comprised the 20 patients with AD (AD2) and 20 normal ADNI participants (NL2) not used for pattern derivation. The
second testing set comprised 10 patients with AD (AD3) and 10 normal controls (NL3) scanned separately at the Feinstein Institute. (B) Top, PDCP was
previously identified by spatial covariance analysis of metabolic images from 15 patients with PD with varying levels of cognitive dysfunction.15 PDCP is
characterized by reduced activity in the presupplementary motor area, premotor, and prefrontal regions and in parietal associative cortex, with relative
increases in the cerebellar vermis and dentate nuclei. Bottom, PDCP expression did not differ (p . 0.14) between patients with AD and controls in the
derivation sample or in the ADNI and Feinstein validation samples. (The covariance maps shown on the top in A and B were overlaid on T1-weighted magnetic
resonance template images. For each pattern, the display was thresholded at jZj 5 1.64 [p , 0.05]. Voxels with positive region weights [relative increases] are
color-coded red; those with negative region weights [relative decreases] are color-coded blue. Error bars shown on the bottom of A and B represent 1 SEM.)

(p , 0.05, Student t tests), but there was no
association with the degree of cognitive impairment
(F3,85 5 1.61, p 5 0.19, 1-way ANOVA). Indeed,
ADRP levels were similarly elevated (p , 0.02,

increases in PDCP expression corresponded with
more severe cognitive dysfunction but without
corresponding differences in ADRP. PDCP and
ADRP expression values did not correlate in the PD
subgroups with dementia (p 5 0.67) or without
dementia (p 5 0.66).
If ADRP expression is present in patients with PD
but does not correlate with cognitive deficits, what
does it represent? Given the aforementioned overlap
in the parietal association cortex between ADRP and
PDRP topographies, we computed expression values
for a modified ADRP topography, called ADRP’,
which was defined by masking the overlapping regions
in each brain before forward application of the native

ADRP pattern (figure e-1A). ADRP’ expression (figure 3C) did not differ from normal in any of the PD
subgroups (p . 0.05, Student t tests) but remained
elevated in each of the AD patient samples (p , 0.01,

thus largely reflects changes in PDRP due to PD
rather than an AD-associated disease process.
PDCP, but not ADRP, expression levels correlate with
neuropsychological measures in patients with PD. We

text). Significant negative correlations (r , 20.32, p , 0.05) were seen between ADRP expression and summary scores for

performance in all 3 domains across the PD patient
subgroups. Summary scores for memory differed across
the PD subgroups (F3,81 5 13.7, p , 0.0001, 1-way
ANOVA), with worse performance in the PD-MCI
and PDD subgroups [p , 0.001 for each subgroup
relative to PD-MCI(2); post hoc Dunnett tests].
Executive function (F3,83 5 5.4, p , 0.002) and
language (F3,82 5 5.3, p , 0.003) showed similar
trends. PD-MCI(m) and patients with PDD exhibited
clear deficits in executive performance compared with
PD-MCI(2) (p , 0.01); language deficits were more
pronounced in the PDD group [p , 0.005 relative to
PD-MCI(2), post hoc Dunnett test].
Higher PDCP expression values reflected
worse summary scores for executive performance
(r 5 20.34, p 5 0.001, figure 3D, left). There

and memory impairment (r 5 20.22, p , 0.04)

did not correlate with cognitive performance in
any of the 3 domains (p . 0.56, figure 3D, right).
Thus, in patients with AD, individual differences
in memory, language, and executive function were
reflected in ADRP but not PDCP expression. In
patients with PD, in contrast, executive function
had a clear relationship with PDCP expression but
not with ADRP expression.

(ADRP: F2,23 5 2.21, p 5 0.13, 1-way
RMANOVA), nor did it correlate with age (p .
0.31). Moreover, although ADRP expression in
these patients was elevated relative to control values
(p , 0.02, Student t test) at all 3 time points, the
expression of ADRP’ did not reach significance at
any time point (p . 0.05, Student t test).
DISCUSSION In this study, we used the distinct network topographies of AD and PD to investigate
whether the cognitive deficits that commonly occur

in patients with PD are more likely attributable to
PD itself or to comorbidity with AD. Our analyses
indicate that, despite overlapping regions of pathology, cognitive dysfunction in PD is largely distinct
from that which occurs in AD.
This is not to say, however, that some patients
with PD may not also have AD. Although most of
the 11 patients with PD with the most severe disease
(PDD) had ADRP expression levels tightly clustered
around the mean, 2 participants showed relatively
high ADRP expression that remained elevated even
after masking regions of ADRP/PDRP overlap in
the parietal association cortex (ADRP: 2.63 and
2.00, subject score 5 0.98 6 0.76 for the remaining
9 PDD cases; ADRP’: 1.40 and 1.85, subject score 5
0.29 6 0.86 for the remaining 9 cases). Even more
strikingly, the patient with PDD with the highest
ADRP’ expression was also exceptional in expressing
almost normal PDCP levels; this patient most likely
has true comorbid AD. It is worth noting that our

STUDY FUNDING

Mean ADRP (squares) and PDCP (triangles) expression in a longitudinal early-stage PD
cohort (see text). PDCP expression values (gray line) increased over time in this group (p ,
0.004, repeated-measures analysis of variance [RMANOVA]), while concurrent ADRP
changes (blue line) did not reach significance (p 5 0.13, RMANOVA). ADRP expression in
these patients was elevated relative to control values (p , 0.02, Student t test) at all time
points; PDCP expression, in contrast, reached abnormal levels (p , 0.001) only at the final
time point. (Error bars represent 1 SE at each time point. *p , 0.05, **p , 0.01, ***p ,
0.001, Student t tests compared to normal controls.)

metabolic network findings complement structural
imaging data showing AD-like volumetric changes
in the cerebral cortex of patients with PD.28 The
pattern of volume loss seen with structural MRI in
patients with AD29 exhibits some topographic homology with ADRP but not with PDCP; it is possible
that Lewy- and Alzheimer-type pathologies affect cognition differently in individuals with PD.6
From a clinical standpoint, it is important for
physicians and patients to recognize that cognitive dysfunction in PD is likely not caused by comorbid AD.
Furthermore, the disease specificity of ADRP and
PDCP provides a distinct contrast with resting-state
networks found in healthy controls such as the default
mode network that show progressive attrition in both
disease populations.30 To fully articulate the relationship of the observed imaging changes with the underlying disease process will require multimodal imaging
in conjunction with molecular genetic analyses and
thorough postmortem assessments. In the meanwhile,
having objective imaging biomarkers to differentiate
between underlying pathologies will help with prognosis, selection of participants for clinical trials, and
choice of treatments when they become available.
