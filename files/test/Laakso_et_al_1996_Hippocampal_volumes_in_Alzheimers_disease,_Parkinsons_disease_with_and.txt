Article abstract--Hippocampal atrophy detected by volumetric MRI is a sensitive feature of early Alzheimer's diueasc
(AD), but there are no studies evaluating hippocampal atrophy by MR volumetry in other dementing diseases. Wc
therefore compared hippocampal volumes in a total of 113 subjects: 50 patients with mild to moderate AD, 9 patients with
vascular dementia (VaD), 12 patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease (PD) without dementia, 8 patients with PD and
dementia (PDD), and 34 elderly control subjects. Thin, coronal, contiguous images were obtained by a 1.5-T M.R imager.
All patient groups had significantly smaller ,volumes of the hippocampus compared with the control group. In the PDL)
group, the absolute volumes were even smaller than in the AD group. In the PD group, the volumes were diminished to a
lesser but significant extent. The volumes in the VaD group varied: of nine patients, two had no atrophy, three had
unilateral, and four had bilateral atrophy. We postulate t h a t hippocampal atrophy does not seem to be a specific
phenomenon of dementia in AD but also occurs in VaD and PDD, and even in PD when no dementia is present. However,
coexistence of AD pathology in our PD and VaD patients cannot be ruled out. Further studies with access to neuropathologic data are needed.
NEUROLOGY 1996;48:678-681

In clinical practice, the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is based on typical features o f t h e disease
and exclusion of' other conditions causing dementia.
In AD, the hippocampus is atrophied early in the
course of the disease,' and the atrophy can be reliably detected by volumetric MRI for diagnostic purposes. ' I With this technique, AD patient:; can be sensitively separated not only from cognitively normal
control subjects, but also from subjects suffering
from differentially important conditions, such as ageassociated memory impairment5 and depressive
pseudodementia." However, the specificity of MRI
volumetry in the evaluation of hippocampal atrophy
in dementing diseases other than AD has not been
determined.
In the diagnostic process of dementias, AD and
vascular dementias (VaD) constitute the largest and
thus differentia Ily most important groups of dementias. These two types of dementia together account
for as much as 90%)of all d e m e n t i a ~ .Moreover,
~
one
of the most common diseases in the elderly that may
be associated with dementia is Parkinson's disease
(PD). In PD, the proportion of demented patients

varies from 40 t o 7091, the percentage increasing
with age.'
In this study, we investigate the specificity ofhippocampal atrophy by comparing hippocam pal volumes of AD patients and cognitively normal control
subjects with volumes of patients with VaD and PD
with dementia (PDD) and without dementia. Our
working hypothesis was that the volume loss of hippocampus would be most pronounced in AD and not
present in PD.
Methods. We evaluated the volumes of hippocampus i n
113 subjects: 50 patients with early probable A11 according
to National Institute of Neurological and Communicative
Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer's Disease a n d Related
Disorders Association criteria"'; 9 patients with VaD according to the DSM-111-R criteria"; 20 patients with idiopathic PD, of whom 8 were demented; and 34 cognitivcly
and neurologically normal subjects (table 1).In addition lo
the MRI, the investigation of the patients and t h e control
subjects included clinical neurologic examination, EEG,
and a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological and
laboratory tests to exclude other causes of dementia and

parkinsonism or other CNS pathology. The complete test
battery that has been described elsewhere4 also included
tests of verbal and visual memory functions such as list
learning test and story recall a s well as the Heaton Visual
Reproduction test. The degree of cognitive decline was
evaluated by using the Mini-Mental Status Examination
(MMSE)." The Webster scale1( was used to estimate the
severity of extrapyramidal signs. The modified ischemic
score'l was also included. The study was approved by the
local ethics committee, and the study subjects gave their
informed consent for participation in t h e study.
The study subjects were scanned with a 1.5-T imager
using a magnetization prepared rapid gradient echo (TR
10 ms, TE 4 ms, TI 250 ms, flip angle 12") resulting in
sagittal TI-weighted contiguous partitions with slice thickness of 1.5 to 2.0 mm, perpendicular to the long axis of the
hippocampus. The hippocampus included the dentate gyrus, the hippocampus proper, and the subicular complex.
The uncal portion of the rostra1 hippocampus that is located ventral to the caudal amygdala was included into t h e
hippocampus. The caudal end of the hippocampus was determined from the section in which the fornices were still
detectable in their full length. The fornices were not, however, included in the volume of the hippocampus. The
boundaries of the hippocampus were outlined by a tractball driven cursor, and the number of voxels within the
region creating the volume was calculated by using a n
in-house developed program. To exclude individual size
variability, the volumes were normalized to coronal intracranial area measured at the level of anterior commissure
(the volumes were multiplied by 100 and divided by intracranial area). All measurements were performed by the
same rater without any knowledge of the clinical data and
diagnostic category of the subjects. The methodology and
reproducibility of the method have been described in detail
elsewhere.'
Statistical analysis. The data were analyzed by SPSSPC+ V.4.1 software (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). ANOVA
with Duncan post-hoc analysis was used to compare the
means over the study groups. Volumes normalized for the
intracranial area were used in all statistical analyses. Correlations were calculated by using two-tailed Pearson's correlation test. The results are expressed as mean 5 SD. The
level of statistical significance of differences is p < 0.05.

Results.

The clinical data of t h e study groups are presented in table 1. ANOVA showed a significant difference
in age (FL4,107l = 2.7, p < 0.05); the VaD patients were
older than AD and PD patients (Duncan p < 0.05). Duration of dementia did not differ in the demented patient
groups. Duration of PD was slightly longer in the PDD
group than in the PD group but not significantly. As expected, the MMSE scores differed significantly (F14,1051 =
49.4, p < 0.0001) across the study groups; the control and
PD groups had higher scores t h a n AD, VaD, and PDD
patients ( p < 0.05), and t h e VaD group had lower scores
t h a n the AD and PDD groups ( p < 0.05). The ischemic
scores also differed significantly (ANOVA p < 0.0001): the
VaD and PDD groups had higher scores than AD, PD, and
control groups ( p < 0.05). However, none of the PDD patients received an ischemic score higher than 4. The Webster scores were significantly higher in PD and PDD than
in AD and VaD groups (ANOVNDuncan p < 0.05).
Seven VaD patients had a history of cerebral infarctions, but at the time of the neurologic examination, right
hemiparesis was present in one VaD patient and left hemiparesis in a second VaD patient. Two AD patients also had
a history of cerebral infarction. The frequency of coronary
heart disease was 19/50 3 8 9 in AD (19/50), 75%)in VaD
( 6 / 8 ) ,38%'in PDD (3/8),
17% in PD patients (2/12), and 3 4
in control subjects ( 1/34). The frequency of hypertonia was
24% in AD, 100% in VaD, 0% in PDD, 8%)in PD, and 12%
in control groups.
In the hippocampal volumes, ANOVA showed significant differences over the study groups both on the right
and left ( p < 0.0001) (table 2, figure, A and B). The control
subjects had larger volumes on both sides than the other
study groups ( p < 0.05).The right hippocampal volumes of
VaD patients were also larger t h a n those of AD, PD, and
PDD patients ( p < 0.05). On the left side, the AD patients
had significantly smaller volumes than VaD and PD patients. The raw volumes i n the PDD group, although not
significantly, were even smaller than in t h e AD group. In
the VaD group, of the nine patients, two had no atrophy at
all, four had bilateral atrophy, and three had unilateral
atrophy. The limit of atrophy was taken as the average
volume of the control group -1 SD, that is, 2,952 mm8 on
the right and 2,700 mmy on the left. These patterns of

atrophy could not be explained by other findings in the

MRI such as location infarcts.
The correlations between hippocampal volumes a n d
performance on memory test scores were significant in AD
and PDD groups but not in VaD, PD, or control groups.
The left hippocampal volume correlated with delayed story
recall ( r = 0.43, n = 48, p < 0.01) in AD and with immediate list learning scores (r = 0.93, n = 7, p < 0.01) in PDD.

Discussion. A noninvasive method for the diagnosis of early AD is urgently needed. Hippocampal
volumetry using MRI has shown potential as a promising and sensitive method for diagnosing early
but this study indicates that hippocampal atrophy is not a specific finding to AD as also occurs in
VaD and PDD as well as, to a lesser degree, in PD
without dement; a. Thus, hippocampal atrophy may
be a common phenomenon to some dementias and
not restricted only to AD. Atrophy of the hippocampus also occurs in amnestic conditions of temporal
lobe pathology.':' The volume of hippocampus correlates with memory functions as measured by tests
assessing delayed reca114J6that are sensitive to dementia and spared by ageing.17J"In this study, left

hippocampal volumes correlated with verbal memory
scores in AD and PDD, although the number of PDD
patients was small. In VaD, PD, or control subjects,
there were no significant correlations between memory scores and hippocampal volumes. Yet, classical
dementia in PD is not regarded as temporal but as
subcortical.'9 In addition, vascular lesions should not
necessarily affect the temporal lobe.
The dementia occurring in PD is not a single concept but consists of a variety of dementia syndromes,
in which the clinical picture depends on separate
pathogenetic mechanisms in different neurotransmitter systems. The typical dementia in PD is a mild
subcortical dementia resulting from dopaminergic insufficiency. The most severe type of disease is PDD
combined with AD pathology, which is present in 10
to 60% of the patients with PD.19 Moreover, AD and
PD share some neurochemical abnormalities in the
brain such as deficits in the cholinergic, serotonergic,
noradrenergic, and dopaminergic systems.") 22 In AD,
the disturbances in the medial temporal lobe structures, the hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, ,and adjacent cortical regions are a central phenomenon.'
Neurofibrillary tangles are present in the entorhinal
region in PD and AD.23,24
The entorhinal cortex is a
major relay station between the hippocampus and
the isocortex, and its bilateral destruction isolates
the hippocampus from isocortical inputs. Thus, the
hippocampal atrophy in our PD and PDD patients
may be explained by the neuropathologw changes
resulting from PD on its own or coexisterice of PD
and AD, particularly in PDD patients.
The patterns of atrophy in the VaD group are
more difficult to explain. In a previous study with
aged rats, chronic vascular insufficiency, without infarctions, mimicked AD-type changes, including high
signal intensities in the hippocampal region predominant on the right side, MR spectroscopic changes,
alterations in local cerebral blood flow, spatial memory dysfunction, and CA1 neuron damage.25Yet, this

does not explain our findings where of the nine VaD
patients, four had bilateral atrophy, two had no atrophy, and three had unilateral atrophy. In three of
the four patients with unilateral atrophy, the right
hippocampus was larger. Other findings in T,weighted axial MRI could not clarify the nature of
these findings. There were no large or strategic infarcts or other lesions in the temporal lobes or in the
area of the posterior cerebral artery responsible for
the circulation to the hippocampus. However, these
patterns of atrophy probably represent the results of
different vascular lesions or etiologies. In the two
VaD patients without atrophy, the lesions causing
the dementia probably did not affect the size of hippocampus. Likewise, in cases with unilateral atrophy, the lesions affect the hippocampus on only one
side. The cases with bilateral atrophy have vascular
lesions affecting the hippocampus bilaterally, or alternatively they may present mixed dementia, that
is, the combination of AD and VaD. In a previous
autopsy study, the presence of mixed dementia was
surprisingly high: three of four patients considered
to have VaD had also AD, and 5 of 16 patients considered to have mixed dementia had AD alone.26
We conclude that hippocampal atrophy is a sensitive feature of AD, but specificity of this atrophy
seems to limit its use in clinical practice.
