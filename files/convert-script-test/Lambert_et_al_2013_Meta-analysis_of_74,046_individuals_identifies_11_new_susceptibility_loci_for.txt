Meta-analysis of 74,046 individuals identifies 11 new
susceptibility loci for Alzheimer’s disease
Eleven susceptibility loci for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease
(LOAD) were identified by previous studies; however, a large
portion of the genetic risk for this disease remains unexplained.
We conducted a large, two-stage meta-analysis of genomewide association studies (GWAS) in individuals of European
ancestry. In stage 1, we used genotyped and imputed data
(7,055,881 SNPs) to perform meta-analysis on 4 previously
published GWAS data sets consisting of 17,008 Alzheimer’s
disease cases and 37,154 controls. In stage 2, 11,632 SNPs
were genotyped and tested for association in an independent
set of 8,572 Alzheimer’s disease cases and 11,312 controls.
In addition to the APOE locus (encoding apolipoprotein E),
19 loci reached genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8) in the
combined stage 1 and stage 2 analysis, of which 11 are newly
associated with Alzheimer’s disease.
Alzheimer’s disease is a devastating neurological disorder primarily
affecting the elderly. The disease manifests with progressive deterioration in cognitive functions, leading to loss of autonomy. The APOE
gene (encoding apolipoprotein E) is a major genetic risk factor for
Alzheimer’s disease1,2. Previous GWAS in individuals of European
ancestry identified nine other genomic regions associated with
LOAD3–7. Recently, a rare susceptibility variant in TREM2 was identified8,9. The search for additional genetic risk factors requires largescale meta-analysis of GWAS to increase statistical power. Under the
banner of I-GAP (International Genomics of Alzheimer’s Project), we
conducted a meta-analysis of 4 GWAS samples of European ancestry
totaling 17,008 cases and 37,154 controls (stage 1) followed up by
genotyping of 11,632 SNPs showing moderate evidence of association
(P < 1 × 10−3 in stage 1) in an independent sample that included 8,572
cases and 11,312 controls (stage 2).
In the stage 1 meta-analysis, we used data from four consortia: the
Alzheimer’s Disease Genetic Consortium (ADGC), the Cohorts for
Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE)
Consortium, the European Alzheimer’s Disease Initiative (EADI) and
the Genetic and Environmental Risk in Alzheimer’s Disease (GERAD)
Consortium (Table 1, Online Methods, Supplementary Table 1 and
Supplementary Note). We used European population reference (EUR)
haplotype data from the 1000 Genomes Project (2010 interim release
based on sequence data freeze from 4 August 2010 and phased haplotypes from December 2010) to impute genotypes for up to 11,863,202
SNPs per data set. We excluded SNPs that did not pass quality control
in each study (Supplementary Table 2 and Supplementary Note).

Our meta-analysis included SNPs either genotyped or successfully
imputed in at least 40% of the Alzheimer’s disease cases and 40%
of the control samples across all data sets (7,055,881 SNPs; Online
Methods). In each data set, genotype dosages were analyzed as
described in the Supplementary Note (Supplementary Table 2). We
performed meta-analysis of the results after applying genomic control
correction to each study. The genomic control inflation factor for the
meta-analysis was 1.087 for the full set of SNPs and 1.082 after excluding SNPs within the APOE locus (chr. 19: 45,409,039–45,412,650) and
within 500 kb of SNPs associated with Alzheimer’s disease at a prespecified level of genome-wide significance (P < 5 × 10−8) in stage 1
(see Supplementary Fig. 1 for quantile-quantile plots).
In addition to the APOE locus, 14 genomic regions had associations that reached the genome-wide significance level (Fig. 1). Nine
had been previously identified by GWAS as genetic susceptibility
factors3–7, and five (HLA-DRB5–HLA-DRB1, PTK2B, SORL1,
SLC24A4-RIN3 and DSG2) represent newly associated loci (Table 2).
SORL1 had previously been identified as an Alzheimer’s disease gene
through candidate gene approaches and in a GWAS combining ADGC
and Asian samples10. Genes attributed to a signal were those closest
to the most significantly associated SNP. However, we are aware that
these are potentially not the causative genes. Detailed results for each
region are given in Supplementary Figures 2–7.
In stage 2, we selected for genotyping all stage 1 SNPs with a
P value less than 1 × 10−3, excluding SNPs flanking APOE (chr. 19:
45,409,039–45,412,650) (n = 19,532; see URLs for database access).
From the initial set of SNPs, 14,445 could be genotyped using Illumina
iSelect technology. After quality control procedures (Online Methods),
we considered 11,632 SNPs for association analysis. The stage 2 sample
included 8,572 cases and 11,312 controls of European ­ancestry originating from Austria, Belgium, Finland, Germany, Greece, Hungary,
Italy, Spain, Sweden, the UK and the United States (Table 1 and
Supplementary Note). We observed 116 SNPs showing the same
risk allele and direction of association in stages 1 and 2 that were
significantly associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk in stage 2 after
a strict Bonferroni correction for multiple testing (P < 4.3 × 10−6).
Of these 116 SNPs, 80 had been associated at genome-wide signi­
ficance with Alzheimer’s disease risk in stage 1. Additionally, in analyses in stage 2, 2,562 SNPs were associated with Alzheimer’s disease at
a nominal level of significance (P < 0.05), having the same risk allele
and direction of association as in stage 1.
The results from stages 1 and 2 and from the combined stage 1
and stage 2 data sets, which represent a secondary discovery effort,

signals regulating neuronal activity such as mitogen-activated protein

long-term potentiation in the hippocampal CA1 (cornu ammonis 1)
region, a central process in the formation of memory17. We cannot,
however, exclude the possibility that there are multiple signals in the
PTK2B-CLU region that are functionally connected to a single gene.
For instance, two SNPs associated with genome-wide significance in
the PTK2B-CLU region are eQTLs for the gene DPYSL2 that has been
implicated in Alzheimer’s disease18 (Supplementary Table 3).
The fourth locus was SLC24A4 (encoding solute carrier family 24

the risk of developing hypertension19,20. SLC24A4 is also expressed
in the brain and may be involved in neural development21. Of note,
in the vicinity of the most strongly associated SNP is another gene
called RIN3 (encoding Ras and Rab interactor 3), and its gene product
directly interacts with the BIN1 gene product22, a protein that may be
connected to tau-mediated pathology23.
In addition to these four loci reaching genome-wide significance
in stage 1, seven new loci reached genome-wide significance in the
combined analysis.
The strongest association at one of these new loci was intronic

domain 1), whose corresponding protein modulates epigenetic regulation24. However, the region defined by all the SNPs associated with
Alzheimer’s disease risk in our data is large and contains about ten
genes (Supplementary Fig. 9b). Another interesting possible candidate gene in the ZCWPW1 region is NYAP1, as disruption of the
corresponding gene in mice affects brain size, neurite elongation and,
more generally, neuronal morphogenesis25. Our data do not resolve
which gene in this region may be causal.
A second locus was within the CELF1 gene (encoding CUGBP, Elavlike family member 1), whose gene product is a member of the protein family that regulates pre-mRNA alternative splicing26. As with the
ZCWPW1 locus, the region of interest is large and contains about ten
genes (Supplementary Fig. 10a). Among these genes is MADD (encoding MAP kinase–activating death domain), the reduced expression of
which may affect long-term neuronal viability in Alzheimer’s disease27.
A discrete signal was observed adjacent to NME8 (encoding NME/
NM23 family member 8), which is responsible for primary ciliary
dyskinesia type 6 (ref. 28).
The FERMT2 gene (encoding fermitin family member 2) is
expressed in the brain. Its corresponding protein localizes to cell
matrix adhesion structures, activates integrins, is involved in the
orchestration of actin assembly and cell shape modulation, and is
an important mediator of angiogenesis 29. An association between
the Drosophila melanogaster ortholog of FERMT2 (fit1/fit2) and
tau-mediated toxicity was recently described30.
We identified a fifth signal on chromosome 20 at CASS4 (encoding Cas scaffolding protein family member 4). Little is known about
the function of the encoded protein. However, the Drosophila CASS
family ortholog (p130CAS) binds to CMS, the Drosophila ortholog
of CD2AP (CMS), a known Alzheimer’s disease susceptibility gene
(Table 2) that is involved in actin dynamics31.
Another locus was identified at INPP5D (encoding inositol
polyphosphate-5-phosphatase, 145 kDa) on chromosome 2. INPP5D
is expressed at low levels in the brain, but the encoded protein has
been shown to interact with CD2AP, whose corresponding gene is one
of the Alzheimer’s disease genes previously identified by GWAS32, and
to modulate, along with GRB2, metabolism of APP33.
We identified a seventh signal adjacent to MEF2C (encoding myocyte
enhancer factor 2). Mutations at this locus are associated with severe
mental retardation, stereotypic movements, epilepsy and cerebral malformation34. The MEF2C protein limits excessive synapse formation
during activity-dependent refinement of synaptic connectivity and thus
may facilitate hippocampal-dependent learning and memory35.
	

In summary, our Alzheimer’s disease GWAS meta-analysis has
identified 11 new susceptibility loci in addition to the already known
ABCA7, APOE, BIN1, CLU, CR1, CD2AP, EPHA1, MS4A6A-MS4A4E
and PICALM genes. However, we were not able to replicate association of CD33 in our stage 2 analysis (P = 0.61). We did not detect any
biases in terms of imputation in our discovery data sets or genotyping
in our replication data sets (data not shown), suggesting a potential
statistical fluctuation across our populations as an explanation for
the lack of replication. However, recent data suggest that genetically
determined decreased CD33 expression might reduce Alzheimer’s
disease risk and interfere with amyloid β peptide clearance36, a dysfunction thought to be central in late-onset forms of Alzheimer’s disease37. Further investigations in independent case-control studies will
thus be required to confirm or refute the association of CD33 with
Alzheimer’s disease.
The newly associated loci reinforce the importance of some previously suspected pathways such as APP (SORL1 and CASS4) and
tau (CASS4 and FERMT2) in pathology. Several candidate genes at
these loci are involved in pathways already shown to be enriched
for association signal in Alzheimer’s disease GWAS38,39, such as
immune response and inflammation (HLA-DRB5–DRB1, INPP5D
and MEF2C), which is also supported by the described association
of Alzheimer’s disease with CR1 (ref. 3) and TREM2 (refs. 8,9), cell
migration (PTK2B) and lipid transport and endocytosis (SORL1).
Our results also suggest the existence of new pathways underlying
Alzheimer’s disease. These pathways could include hippocampal synaptic function (MEF2C and PTK2B), cytoskeletal function and axonal
transport (CELF1, NME8 and CASS4), regulation of gene expression
and post-translational modification of proteins, and microglial and
myeloid cell function (INPP5D).
Examining the genetic effect attributable to all the associated
loci, we demonstrated that the most strongly associated SNPs at
each locus other than APOE had population-attributable fractions
(PAFs) or preventive fractions between 1.0–8.0% in the stage 2
sample (Supplementary Table 6). Strong efforts in sequencing
and post-GWAS analyses will now be required to fully characterize the candidate genes and functional variants responsible for the
association of these GWAS-identified loci with Alzheimer’s disease
risk and to understand their exact roles in the pathophysiology of
Alzheimer’s disease40,41.

All case-control studies are described in Table 1, in the Supplementary Note
(see full description of the I-GAP data sets) and in Supplementary Tables 1, 7
and 8. Written informed consent was obtained from study participants or, for
those with substantial cognitive impairment, from a caregiver, legal guardian
or other proxy, and the study protocols for all populations were reviewed and
approved by the appropriate institutional review boards.
Imputation and SNP selection for stage 1 analysis. After quality control
criteria were finalized for each individual and each sample collection (SNPs
with call rates of <95% were excluded; Supplementary Note), IMPUTE2
(ref. 42) or MaCH/Minimac43 software (Supplementary Table 2) was used
to impute the genotypes of all participants with haplotypes derived from samples of European ancestry in the 1000 Genome Project (2010 interim release
based on the sequence data freeze from 4 August 2010 and phased haplotypes
from December 2010). In each data set, SNPs with R2 or info score quality
estimates of less than 0.3, as indicated by MaCH or IMPUTE2, respectively
(with these two quality estimates described to be equivalent), were excluded
from analyses. Similarly, SNPs with a MAF of <1% were also excluded. After
these procedures, a maximum of 8,133,148 SNPs were retained that were
present in at least 1 data set.
In each case-control data set, the association of LOAD with genotype dosage was analyzed by a logistic regression model including covariates for age,
sex and principal components to adjust for possible population stratification
(Supplementary Table 2). For the three CHARGE cohorts with incident
Alzheimer’s disease data, Cox proportional hazards models were used. The four
consortia used different but analogous software for these analyses (PLINK 44,
SNPTEST45, ProbABEL46 or R; Supplementary Table 2). Three of these tools
were applied to the EADI data set for quality control, and very similar results
were observed. After the exclusion of SNPs showing logistic regression coefficient |β| > 5 or P value equal to 0 or 1, the maximum number of SNPs in any
data set was 8,131,643. Each consortium uploaded summarized results for each
SNP to an internal I-GAP website for access by members of each consortium.
SNPs genotyped or imputed in at least 40% of Alzheimer’s disease cases and
40% of control samples were included in the meta-analysis. This threshold
represented the best compromise between maximizing the total number of
SNPs and maximizing the number of samples in which the given SNP was
present. Indeed, analyzing all SNPs available in at least one study could have
greatly increased the risk of false positives. On the other hand, studying SNPs
only present in all studies could have led to the removal of SNPs of potential
interest, even if those SNPs could have reached adequate statistical power in
a more limited number of data sets (false negatives). This approach allowed
us to increase homogeneity between studies for some SNPs by excluding poor
quality data present only in a limited number of data sets of small size. This last
selection step led to a final number of 7,055,881 SNPs in stage 1 analysis.
iSelect microarray design and stage 2 SNP quality control. SNPs associated with Alzheimer’s disease risk and exhibiting P value < 1 × 10−3 in stage 1
analysis were selected for replication. A list of 19,532 SNPs was submitted to
a devoted Illumina website to develop an iSelect microarray. A total of 16,732
SNPs exhibiting an Illumina score superior or equal to 0.4 were selected for
microarray production. During the Illumina production process, 2,287 SNPs
failed oligonucleotide synthesis, leading to a final number of 14,445 SNPs
for which genotyping was attempted. Genotyping failure led to the further
exclusion of an additional 1,999 SNPs as a result of the SNPs (i) having no
intensity signal (n = 559), (ii) not being polymorphic (n = 1,176), (iii) only
being found in a heterozygous state (n = 248) or (iv) having mismatched alleles
compared to 1000 Genomes Project data (n = 16). Finally, several quality control measures were applied to the remaining 12,446 SNPs to detect potential
biases in genotyping. We first tested for discrepancies in allelic frequency
between the 1000 Genomes Project EUR reference panel and stage 2 data.
Allele frequencies for stage 2 data were estimated on 10,750 controls (see
“Stage 2 sample quality control”) and after exclusion of Finnish individuals.
The allelic test was performed with PLINK, and P values were computed
by performing 4,500,000 permutations to avoid an assumption of HardyWeinberg equilibrium. In total, 798 SNPs showed a highly significant
difference in terms of allele frequency between the 1000 Genomes Project

Nature Genetics

EUR reference panel and stage 2 data (P < 1 × 10−5; Supplementary Fig. 18)
and were excluded from the analysis.
Other SNP quality control steps were performed separately in data for each
country. A SNP was considered of low genotyping quality in a country data
set if it had missing genotype data for more than 10% of the individuals, if
the P value for the Hardy-Weinberg test in controls was lower than 1 × 10−6
or if the P value for the test for differences in missingness between cases and
controls was lower than 1 × 10−6 (see Supplementary Table 9 for differences
in missingness assessed for suggestive and significant hits across European
populations). These quality control steps led to the removal of 16 SNPs with
low genotyping quality in data from all countries.
After SNP quality control, 11,632 SNPs were considered to be of high genotyping quality in at least 1 country and were analyzed in stage 2. For imputed
data sets, SNPs were considered to be of low imputation quality if their info
score was <0.3.
Of note, of the 7,086 SNPs that we were unable to successfully genotype,
only 471 were not tagged by another successfully genotyped variant (±100 kb)
and associated with a P value at least 10 times higher than that of the missing SNP. Because the vast majority of the untagged SNPs exhibited stage 1
P values between 1 × 10−3 and 1 × 10−4 (92%), the likelihood of missing a true
association was considered to be low.
Stage 2 sample quality control. The iSelect microarray contained 33,368 SNPs,
of which 11,632 were devoted to stage 2. These supplementary SNPs included
various genetic data that allowed us to further refine our quality control processes. On the basis of data for all of these SNPs, we excluded individuals who
had more than 3% missing genotypes, showed a discrepancy between reported
sex and sex estimated on the basis of genetic data (genetic sex) or showed
evidence of non-European ancestry. Duplicated and related individuals were
identified (Supplementary Table 10). Briefly, discrepancies in sex were examined using genetic sex as estimated by PLINK on 40 SNPs on chromosome X.
We also removed 93 individuals from a single plate for whom an abnormal
number of discrepancies in sex were observed, suggesting that sample mixing
had occurred. Using a panel of 261 ancestry-informative ­markers (AIMs), we
performed a principal-component analysis (PCA) on HapMap 2 data with the
function SMARTPCA from EIGENSOFT 4.2 software 47. For each country,
individuals were projected onto the first two PCA axes to define their genetic
ancestry. Individuals with evidence of non-European ancestry were then identified by applying a Bayesian clustering approach 48 to their coordinates on
the first two axes. Identity by descent (IBD) was computed for all pairs of
individuals using PLINK, and individuals in a pair with IBD greater than 0.98
were considered to be duplicates. If clinical data for duplicated individuals
were discordant, both individuals were excluded. Otherwise, the individual
with the greater proportion of missing genotype was excluded. Similarly, IBD
was computed for all pairs of individuals in data from each country separately,
using 6,764 autosomal SNPs with MAF of >1% and selected to minimize LD.
Individuals in pairs with IBD greater than 0.2 were considered to be related
and were iteratively removed so as to obtain a sample of unrelated individuals
within each country data set.
Finally, individuals with missing clinical data and controls less than
25 years of age were excluded from the analysis. After sample quality
control (Supplementary Table 10), 19,884 individuals (8,572 cases and 11,312
controls) were available for analysis in stage 2.
Statistical analysis. For the stage 1 meta-analysis, we undertook fixed-effects
inverse variance-weighted meta-analysis with the standard errors of the
β-coefficient scaled by the square roots of study-specific genomic inflation
factors estimated before combining the summary statistics across data sets.
Each consortium performed an independent stage 1 meta-analysis after downloading the data files available on the I-GAP website. Two software packages were used for meta-analysis: METAL49 and GWAMA50. Very similar
results were generated independently of the software used and as expected,
perfect matching was observed between the analyses undertaken by each of
the 4 consortia.
For stage 2, association tests were performed for each country for all highquality genotyped SNPs under an additive model, using logistic regression
as implemented in PLINK. Analysis was adjusted for age, sex and principal

c­ omponents, when necessary. Using SMARTPCA, PCA was performed on
individuals from each country separately. Difference in PCA coordinates
between cases and controls were tested for the first four principal components,
and analysis was further adjusted on principal components if the P value of this
test was lower than 0.05. PCA for Bonn stage 2 samples was based on GWAS
data. For imputed data sets, association tests were performed using likelihood
score tests for missing data as implemented in SNPTEST. Genotyped and
imputed German samples were analyzed separately, and results were then
combined by fixed-effects meta-analysis using the inverse variance approach
as implemented in METAL. Using this approach, a fixed-effects meta-analysis
was then performed to combine stage 2 results from the different countries.
We also performed the analysis separately for each center in stage 2 and combined the results by fixed-effects meta-analysis. Results were similar to those
obtained when analysis was performed by country (data not shown).
We finally generated fixed-effects inverse variance–weighted meta-analyses
by combining summary statistics across ADGC, CHARGE, EADI, GERAD
and stage 2 data by country. At this point, we performed Cochran’s Q test for
heterogeneity and generated I2 estimates with METAL to evaluate the possible
effect of study heterogeneity on the results.
A graphic representation of the association signal in the stage 1 data was
generated with LocusZoom software51 for all the loci of interest reaching a
genome-wide significant level after combined stage 1 and stage 2 analyses.
PAF was calculated using the Levin equation52.
Annotation of I-GAP top SNPs for eQTLs. To gain further biological insights,
we explored reported associations between SNPs in the top I-GAP loci and
gene expression. We first selected all SNPs that reached genome-wide signi­
ficance (P value ≤ 5 × 10−8) in the combined stage 1 and stage 2 analysis
and were located in a 500-kb window upstream or downstream of the top

doi:10.1038/ng.2802

SNP at each locus (Table 2). We then searched for published data on gene
expression associated with each of these SNPs in the eQTL database from the
Pritchard laboratory (see URLs). For each reported eQTL gene and each type
of eQTL association as defined in this database, we then counted the number
of reported eQTL SNPs and selected the one with the lowest P value.
