Article abstract-Magnetic resonance imaging (MR1)-based volumetric measurements of medial temporal lobe (MTL)
structures can discriminate between normal elderly control subjects and patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) of
moderate to advanced severity. In terms of clinical utility, however, a more important issue concerns the ability of the
technique to differentiate between normal elderly control subjects and AD patients with the very mildest form of the
disease. We performed MRI-based volumetric measurements of the hippocampus, parahippocampal gyrus, and amygdala
in 126 cognitively normal elderly control subjects and 94 patients with probable AD. The diagnosis of AD was made
according to NINDS/ADRDA criteria, and disease severity was categorized by Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) scores.
Patients with CDR 0.5 were classified as very mild, CDR 1 as mild, and CDR 2 as moderate disease severity. Volumes of
each structure declined with increasing age in control subjects and did so in parallel for men and women. The volume of
each measured MTL structure also declined with age in patients with AD. The volume of each MTL structure was
significantly smaller in AD patients than control subjects ( p < 0.001). Of the several MTL measures, the total hippocampal volumetric measurements were best at discriminating control subjects from AD patients. The mean hippocampal
volumes for AD patients relative to control subjects by severity of disease were as follows: very mild AD (CDR 0.5) -1.75
SD below the control mean, mild AD (CDR 1) -1.99 SD, and moderate AD (CDR 2) -2.22 SD. Age- and gender-adjusted,
normalized MRI-based hippocampal volumetric measurements provide a sensitive marker of the MTL neuroanatomic
degeneration in AD early in the disease process.

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is the most common cause
of dementia in individuals older than 60 years of
age.1-3A well-accepted biological concomitant of AD
is cerebral a t r ~ p h y The
. ~ rationale for quantitative
MRI of medial temporal lobe (MTL) atrophy in the
diagnosis of AD is: (1)a memory impairment is usually the earliest and most severe clinical manifestation of AD, (2) MTL limbic structures are central to
the integrity of declarative memory f ~ n c t i o n ,(3)
~
MTL limbic structures are involved earliest and
most extensively in the pathology of AD,6,7and (4)
several principal MTL limbic structures are amenable to accurate volumetric quantitation by MRI-the
hippocampal formation, amygdala, and parahippocampal gyrus (PHG).8-12Based on initial studies,
MRI-based volumetric measurements of the MTL
have been proposed as a clinically useful test for the
diagnosis of AD.13-21Some limitations of the published data include: (1) anatomic boundary criteria
for the various MTL structures varied significantly
among the different studies, (2) different structures
or combinations of MTL structures were evaluated in
the various studies, (3) relatively small numbers of

subjects were included in individual studies, and (4)
rigorous definitions of the severity of AD often were
not employed. Most previous studies have primarily
included subjects with AD of moderate severity. Consequently, the differences between the AD patients
and control subjects with regard to MTL atrophy
have been dramatic. The most important test of the
utility of the technique would be in patients with
very mild AD in whom the diagnostic decisionmaking process is difficult.
We report a large series of carefully evaluated and
longitudinally followed subjects with AD and a large
group of prospectively studied normal elderly control
subjects. The AD patients were categorized on basis
of severity and include a large sample of individuals
with very mild AD. As such, we are able to evaluate
the utility of volumetric MRI in assisting in the clinical diagnosis of AD at its most mild stages. The
goals of this study were (1)to characterize volumetric changes in the hippocampus, amygdala, and PHG
in normal aging and in AD; and (2) to estimate the
ability of these measures to discriminate between

The posterior boundary of the PHG was defined in a
manner identical to that for the hippocampal formation.
The superior boundary of the PHG was defined as the
gray-white matter interface between the subiculum and
the PHG white matter. Medially the PHG was demarcated
by CSF in the uncal cistern. Laterally and inferiorly its
boundary was the collateral sulcus. The imaging slice immediately preceding that in which the hippocampal intralimbic gyrus first appeared when progressing from posterior to anterior was defined as the anterior boundary of the
PHG. In some patients a clearly identifiable collateral sulcus was not present along the entire anteroposterior extent
of the PHG. For this reason, PHG measurements were not
possible in 16 control subjects and 14 AD patients.
The posterior, superior, medial, and lateral boundaries
of the amygdala were defined by gray-white matter borders or, where appropriate, CSF in the uncal cistern. The
inferior border of the amygdala was either the uncal recess
of the temporal horn or the alveus covering the hippocampal head. The anterior boundary of the amygdala is ill
defined in nature, and we defined it operationally to be the
most anterior slice on which the head of the hippocampus
was present.
Statistical methods. Individual MTL structure volumes were normalized for intersubject variation in head
size by dividing structure volume (in cubic millimeters) by

were evaluated using stepwise regression, including evaluation of nonlinearity and interactions. Stepwise regression
was also used to determine if variability was associated
with age or gender.
Volumetric percentiles in controls specific for age and
gender were obtained using the algorithm described by
O'Brien and D y ~ k Age. ~ ~ and gender-specific volumetric
percentiles among AD patients were determined and converted to W scores (normal deviates) using the inverse of
the standard normal distribution (a percentile value of 95
corresponding to a W score of 1.645, for example).38The W
score value is a covariate-adjusted Z score relative to the
control group. Comparison of W values among MTL anatomic structures for AD patients was performed using
ANOVA for repeated measures and paired t-tests. To identify the MTL limbic structures that best distinguish between AD and control subjects, we performed a stepwise
discriminant analysis including normalized volumes, age,
and gender as predictor variables.

Results. Two hundred twenty subjects are included in
this report-126 control subjects and 94 AD patients (table
1). The control and AD patients were well matched on
education and gender distribution with approximately a
2:l female-to-male ratio in both groups. The age range of
control subjects was 51 to 89 years and of AD patients was
50 to 89 years. Forty-four of the 126 control subjects were
men, 16 of the 36 CDR 0.5 Alzheimer disease patients
were men, 10 of the 43 CDR 1 patients were men, and
seven of the 15 CDR 2 patients were men. As expected,

Control subjects. Normalized MTL volumes declined
with age in a linear fashion (table 2, figure 2). The segment of the hippocampus that demonstrated the greatest
decline with age was the head. No significant hemispheric
differences in volume loss with age were observed in any
MTL structure, except the PHG where the age-related volume loss was greater on the left than the right side ( p =
0.024). The mean unnormalized volumetric decline with
age was 45.63 mm3 per year for the total hippocampus,
27.43 mm3 for the hippocampal head, 8.84 mm3 for the
hippocampal body, 9.68 mm3 for the hippocampal tail,
46.65 mm3 for the PHG, and 20.75 mm3 for the amygdala.
Mean total intracranial volume in control subjects was
1,393cm3 t- 133 cm3 (SD).
The unnormalized MTL structure volumes of men were
generally larger than those of women, while the normalized MTL volumes of women were generally larger than
those of men (see table 2 and figure 2 ) . That is, these MTL
limbic structures occupied a larger percentage of TIV in
women than in men. The decline in volume associated with
age did not differ significantly between men and women.
These associations were used to estimate age- and genderspecific normal percentiles for TIV-normalized MTL volumes (table 3).

jects over the age range studied (see table 2 and figure 2 ) .
As with controls, unnormalized volumes were generally
larger among men than women, while larger normalized
volumes were observed among female AD patients. Associations between MTL volume and age were linear, and did
not differ between men and women. The segment of the
hippocampus showing the greatest decline with age was
the head.
Age- and gender-specific percentiles for normalized volumes were computed for each of the AD patients, and
these were converted to W scores (corresponding to a normal distribution; table 4).Thus, values of W < 0 indicate
that volume is less than the mean value expected for a
normal subject after adjustment for age and gender. A
value of -1.96 corresponds to a value that is at the 2.5
percentile among normal controls.
We assessed the extent to which patients differed from
control subjects, and for each anatomic structure W scores
were significantly < O among AD patients ( p < 0.001). As
would be expected from table 2, the deficit in volumes
relative to controls was not associated with age or gender.
We also assessed whether the magnitude of the volumetric
deficit in cases relative to controls was greater in some
structures than others. The differences among the hippocampus, PHG, and amygdala were significant ( p I
0.001, ANOVA), and all pairwise comparisons (paired
t-tests) were also significant (hippocampus versus amygdala, p < 0.001; hippocampus versus PHG, p < 0.001;
amygdala versus PHG, p = 0.006; see table 4). Within the
hippocampus, volumes differed significantly among the

Discrimination between controls and A D patients of
varying severity. Using stepwise linear discriminant
analysis (including age, gender, and TIV-normalized volumes as independent variables) to predict AD, the only
variables that appeared in the final model were hippocampal volume, hippocampal volume squared, and age. Although all these terms were significant a t the 0.02 level,
the prediction equation was dominated by the linear hippocampal volume term, and the accuracy of the prediction
was identical to that obtained using hippocampal W scores
alone. The sensitivity of hippocampal volumes to distinguish AD patients from control subjects was assessed by
computing the percentage of AD patients with W scores a t
selected percentiles among control subjects (table 5). For
example, at a fixed specificity of 80%, the sensitivity of
hippocampal volumetric measurements in discriminating
control subjects from patients was 77.8% for CDR 0.5,
83.7% for CDR 1, and 86.7% for CDR 2. Discrimination
between control subjects and AD patients was roughly
equivalent among the three AD severity groups at the 50th
and 20th percentiles of normal. Discrimination was
greater for CDRs 1 and 2 than CDR 0.5 patients at the
10th and fifth percentile of normal. At the first percentile
of normal, discrimination improved as the patient’s disease
severity (CDR score) increased.

Discussion. In this study involving a large group
of well-characterized AD patients and elderly control
subjects we have demonstrated that MR volumetric

measurements of the hippocampal formation are
useful in discriminating between very mild AD and
elderly control subjects. The very mild AD subjects

The apolipoprotein E €4 allele is not

Article abstract-The objective of our study was to examine the relationship between the presence of the apolipoprotein
E (apo E) €4 allele, psychiatric symptoms, and extrapyramidal signs (EPS) in probable Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The apo
E €4 allele modifies the risk and age a t onset of AD. However, it still needs t o be determined whether it is a marker for
specific clinical subgroups. The frequency of clinical signs and symptoms was examined in 194 AD patients with the apo E
€313 (N = 791, €314 (N = 96), and €414 (N = 19) genotypes participating in a longitudinal study of dementia. Each patient
was assessed with semistructured psychiatric and neurologic examinations. Patients with the €414 genotype had an earlier
age a t onset of dementia ( p = 0.03). However, no individual psychiatric symptom or neurologic sign was associated with
the presence of the apo E €4 allele, including major depression (odds ratio [OR], 1.14; GI, 0.50 to 2.45; p = 0.781, psychosis
(e.g., delusions and hallucinations) (OR, 0.66, GI, 0.35 to 1.25; p = 0.20), and EPS (in neuroleptic-free patients) (OR, 0.82,
GI, 0.45 to 1.49; p = 0.52), after controlling by age at onset, duration of the symptoms, education, and severity of
dementia. The presence of the apo E €4 allele has limited utility in the characterization of neurologic and psychiatric
subgroups in probable AD patients. The apo E €414 genotype appears to be related to age a t onset of AD, consistent with
previous findings.
NEUROLOGY 1997;49:794-797

The apolipoprotein E (apo E) €4 allele has been
shown to modify risk and age at onset of Alzheimer’s
disease (AD).1-3 Neuropathologic studies have found
more severe AD pathology in subjects carrying the
apo E €4 allele than in those without the allele. This
includes more cortical neurofibrillary tangles and senile (neuritic) plaques (SP),4and a more severe cholinergic deficit in the frontal lobes5 Moreover, neuroimaging studies have shown greater atrophy in

medial temporal structures in AD patients carrying
the apo E €4 allele.6
The development of psychiatric symptoms appears
t o be related t o more severe neuropathologic
change^^-^ and to specific neurotransmitter imbalances, notably acetylcholinelO and serotonin.ll Consequently, given that patients carrying the apo E €4
allele have more severe structural and neurochemical abnormalities, psychiatric symptoms should be
