ABSTRACT
Accurate and timely diagnosis of dementia is important
to guide management and provide appropriate
information and support to patients and families.
Currently, with the exception of individuals with genetic
mutations, postmortem examination of brain tissue
remains the only deﬁnitive means of establishing
diagnosis in most cases, however, structural
neuroimaging, in combination with clinical assessment,
has value in improving diagnostic accuracy during life.
Beyond the exclusion of surgical pathology, signal
change and cerebral atrophy visible on structural MRI
can be used to identify diagnostically relevant imaging
features, which provide support for clinical diagnosis of
neurodegenerative dementias. While no structural
imaging feature has perfect sensitivity and speciﬁcity for
a given diagnosis, there are a number of imaging
characteristics which provide positive predictive value
and help to narrow the differential diagnosis. While
neuroradiological expertise is invaluable in accurate scan
interpretation, there is much that a non-radiologist can
gain from a focused and structured approach to scan
analysis. In this article we describe the characteristic MRI
ﬁndings of the various dementias and provide a
structured algorithm with the aim of providing clinicians
with a practical guide to assessing scans.

There are an estimated 36 million people with
dementia worldwide, with this ﬁgure expected to
double every 20 years as the population ages.1 In
response to this challenge a number of countries have
committed to long-term national dementia strategies,
which include improving timely diagnosis.2–5 For
many patients there are delays in diagnosis of dementia, preventing them from accessing relevant care services, information and treatment.6–8 Patients with
unrecognised cognitive impairment present in a range
of clinical settings often with health concerns unrelated to dementia: in one study 42% of those aged
over 70 years admitted to an acute medical admissions unit had dementia, with only half having been
diagnosed prior to admission.9
The most common causes of dementia are
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), vascular disease (in several
forms), dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD), but there are
many others.10 11 Accurate and early diagnosis has
considerable implications for the patient in terms of
prognosis and management and will be increasingly
important if and when disease modifying treatments
become available. Currently, postmortem examination of brain tissue remains the only deﬁnitive

means of establishing diagnosis in most cases.
Molecular biomarkers are now available to provide
support for a diagnosis of AD in life, for example,
amyloid imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) and cerebrospinal ﬂuid (CSF) analysis
of amyloid-β (Aβ1–42) and tau,12 13 however, these
markers are mainly research tools and deﬁnitive
blood tests are still lacking. Until these techniques
become widely available, structural neuroimaging, in
combination with clinical assessment, offers the
greatest utility in improving diagnostic accuracy
during life.
The UK National Institute of Health and Care
Excellence (NICE), European and US diagnostic
guidelines14–17 recommend that structural imaging
(non-contrast enhanced CT or ideally MRI) should
be performed in the evaluation of patients with suspected dementia. In recognition of advances in
imaging research, the justiﬁcation for this has
shifted from the exclusion of surgical pathology
(eg, cerebral tumours), although still relevant, to
the inclusion of features that help to support a clinical diagnosis of the underlying cause(s) of the
dementia. MRI offers a number of advantages over
CT18 and is the imaging modality of choice in identifying diagnostic imaging features.14 15 17 While
no structural imaging features have perfect sensitivity
and speciﬁcity for any given diagnosis, there are a
number which provide positive predictive value and
help to narrow the differential diagnosis to the most
likely underlying pathologies. By describing these
characteristic MRI ﬁndings in the context of a structured algorithm, this article aims to provide clinicians
with a practical means of extracting useful imaging
features of common dementias in order to improve
diagnostic accuracy. While neuroradiology expertise
is invaluable in accurate scan interpretation, there is
much that a non-radiologist can gain from a focused
and structured approach to scan analysis.

SYSTEMATIC ASSESSMENT OF STRUCTURAL
IMAGING
Beyond the exclusion of surgical pathology, structural
MRI in patients with suspected dementia should be
assessed in terms of signal change on MRI and cerebral atrophy in a systematic fashion.19 The assessment
of signal change using T2-weighted imaging or ﬂuid
attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) can be used to
help identify vascular damage, but can also indicate
inﬂammatory, metabolic, toxic or infective processes
which may be contributing to cognitive deﬁcits. The
presence and topographical pattern of cerebral
atrophy has (pathologically proven) positive predictive value for dementia.20 Based on these two broad

categories, a systematic approach to identifying diagnostically relevant imaging features, which provide support for clinical diagnosis,
is presented in ﬁgure 1 and discussed in detail below and
expanded in ﬁgures 2 and 3. Using the predominant imaging features of the most common causes of dementia, the diagnosis with
the greatest likelihood is presented. Figure 4 presents (mostly
pathologically proven) imaging examples of many of the features
described.

THE ALGORITHM
Exclusion of surgical pathology
The exclusion of a structural brain lesion potentially amenable
to surgical intervention should be the starting point when
reviewing structural imaging. These include tumour (eg, meningioma, glioma), subdural haematoma, arteriovenous malformation and hydrocephalus. Idiopathic normal pressure
hydrocephalus should also be considered, although imaging
markers have not yet proved sensitive enough for reliable
diagnosis.21 22

Assessment of ‘signal change’
Signal intensity within a single tissue type should be reasonably
uniform on MRI. The presence of regions of hyperintensity or

hypointensity within the tissue typically reﬂects pathology. In
the context of a suspected dementia, punctate or conﬂuent
regions of signal change within white matter or deep grey
matter are most commonly associated with vascular pathology,
but rarely (and in the correct clinical context) may also indicate
inﬂammatory, metabolic or infective processes. The prevalence
of vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) is second only to AD.
They share many risk factors, including an increasing prevalence
with age, and therefore, in many patients vascular and degenerative pathology coexist.23 The exact interaction between neurodegenerative and vascular pathology is debated but critically for
the patient, it is important that vascular risk factors are
managed and treated. Differentiating the relative contribution of
vascular from neurodegenerative pathology as the cause of a
patient’s cognitive problems is a common clinical problem
where MRI plays a central role. If MRI is not possible, CT can
also be used relatively effectively to evaluate the presence and
extent of cerebrovascular disease, with changes in white matter
appearing hypodense.
Clinical and research guidelines require imaging evidence of
cerebrovascular disease for a diagnosis of vascular dementia
(VaD) or VCI to be made.23 24 In the absence of evidence of
vascular damage on MRI a vascular cause for cognitive impairment is very unlikely; conversely, extensive vascular changes are
very likely to produce signiﬁcant cognitive deﬁcits.25 The clinical difﬁculty lies in determining whether a mild or moderate
degree of vascular changes is sufﬁcient to explain the clinical
picture, particularly in older people where mixed vascular and
neurodegenerative pathology is more common. While it remains
important to address treatable vascular risk factors, treating a
potential neurodegenerative condition, for example, with cholinesterase inhibition should not be overlooked. Serial imaging
may help identify the relative contributions and there is some
evidence that the rate of cognitive decline may provide further
evidence of the underlying pathology, with patients with VaD
typically declining at a slower rate than patients with neurodegenerative pathology.26
T2-weighted images including FLAIR are most useful in
detecting ischaemic changes while T2* or susceptibility
weighted imaging can identify microbleeds suggestive of cerebral
amyloid angiopathy or arteriosclerotic small vessel disease
(SVD). Diffusion weighted imaging may be useful in cases of
rapid cognitive decline suggestive of prion disease. Figure 2
describes a systematic assessment of MR signal changes in the
context of dementia.

FLAIR/T2 hyperintensity

Figure 1 Algorithmic assessment of MRI in dementia.

▸ Located in cerebral white matter: Hyperintensities in cerebral
white matter on T2-weighted or FLAIR imaging, and less
prominently on T1-weighted imaging, are more likely to be
vascular in origin. If deep grey matter and brainstem hyperintensities are also apparent the term subcortical hyperintensities of presumed vascular origin should be used.27 The
severity of hyperintensities can be visually quantiﬁed by
application of an established rating scale such as the
age-related white matter changes scale28 or the Fazekas
scale.29 Conﬂuence of hyperintensities in at least two
regions, and the beginning of conﬂuence of hyperintensities
in a further two regions, is considered to represent the
involvement of at least a quarter of the total white matter
and is sufﬁcient to assume SVD is the cause of VCI or
VaD.30 However, even in cases of extensive white matter
hyperintensities, the existence of mixed pathology should be
considered, although it may be difﬁcult to conﬁrm or refute.

Figure 2 An approach to signal change assessment in cognitive impairment.

Extension of conﬂuent hyperintensities into the temporal
poles is rare and may indicate that the pathology is not of
‘conventional’ vascular origin. If the patient has a positive
family history of dementing illness and is known to have suffered previously from strokes and/or migraines, cerebral
autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts
and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) should also be

considered and genetic testing may be appropriate19 31 (see
ﬁgure 4). Although a relatively rare form of dementia,
CADASIL is included here due to this fairly speciﬁc (but not
entirely sensitive) feature of non-enhancing hyperintensities
extending in to the temporal poles, with white matter
changes often appearing relatively more severe than expected
from the patient’s clinical appearance. While temporal lobe

extension raises the question of CADASIL it may also feature
in demyelinating conditions such as multiple sclerosis.32 If
demyelinating disease is a diagnostic consideration then contrast enhanced axial T1-weighted brain scanning with
Gadolinium may demonstrate active/new lesions.33 Less often,
multifocal/conﬂuent regions of hyperintensity in a patient with
suspected dementia may result from a number of other conditions, including infections, inﬂammatory demyelinating diseases, leukodystrophies or leukoencephalopathies.19 34
Infective processes may need consideration in immunocompromised patients at risk of opportunistic infections, including
cerebral toxoplasmosis.35
▸ Strategic Infarcts: T2/FLAIR hyperintensities with corresponding T1 hypointensity in strategic locations such as
arterial territories, association areas and watershed carotid
territories may be sufﬁcient to produce cognitive symptoms
which can be termed VaD due to large vessel disease.30 36
Hyperintensities with CSF-like signal intensity on all MRI
sequences (dark on T1 and FLAIR, bright on T2) in the
region of a single deep perforating arteriole are likely to represent recent small deep brain infarcts.27 The inclusion of a
rim of hyperintensity on FLAIR images (thought to reﬂect
gliosis) is sufﬁcient to indicate a lacune of vascular origin,
and is useful to help distinguish them from prominent perivascular spaces.27 Additionally, prominent perivascular
spaces will typically appear linear when imaged parallel to
the course of the vessel, and round or ovoid, with a diameter
generally smaller than 3 mm, when imaged perpendicular to
the course of the vessel.27 Bilateral thalamic lesions are sufﬁcient to imply VaD due to SVD.30 It should be noted that
T2-weighted images are more sensitive to signal change in
the thalamus than FLAIR images.37
▸ Striatum and/or neocortex: Although rare, Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease is included in the algorithm as it has very characteristic MRI features: hyperintensities in the cortex and/or basal

ganglia, particularly in the putamen, best seen on FLAIR
imaging. Diffusion weighted imaging sequences have greater
sensitivity to hyperintensities within these regions38 (see
ﬁgure 4), which may be especially prominent in the early
stages of the disease when vacuoles are small resulting in
restricted diffusion.19 In rapidly progressive dementia where
there is doubt over the diagnosis of Creutzfeldt-Jakob
disease, contrast enhanced MRI scanning is recommended to
rule out alternative causes.
▸ No Regions of Hyperintensity: The absence of hyperintensities on T2 or FLAIR imaging indicates the patient’s symptoms are very unlikely to be vascular in origin.
Neurodegenerative pathology therefore remains the most
likely cause of cognitive impairment and structural imaging
should be assessed for atrophy.

T2* hypointensity
T2* gradient-echo (or susceptibility weighted imaging) is required
in order to detect cerebral microhaemorrhages or microbleeds
(CMBs). Radiologically these are deﬁned as small, rounded,
homogeneous hypointense lesions,39 while pathologically they
have been found to represent focal leakage of blood-breakdown
products from abnormal (small) blood vessels.40 The location of
CMBs broadly reﬂects their underlying cause, with CMBs associated with hypertension developing in deep brain regions (basal
ganglia, thalamus and brainstem), while the distribution of CMBs
associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (eg, in AD) is mostly
cortical-subcortical (lobar)19 (see ﬁgure 4); although the two conditions often coexist in elderly subjects.41 42 A conservative estimate from a large population based study suggests the incidence
of microbleeds in the general population is approximately 10%.43
T2* hypointensities may also result from calciﬁcation, iron
deposits (from causes other than CMBs), haemorrhagic metastasis or diffuse axonal injury. Care should also be taken to exclude
MR artefacts such as ﬂow voids or signals from temporal bones.

Neurodegeneration
Cerebral atrophy assessment
Atrophy is the principal imaging ﬁnding in neurodegenerative
dementias and is typically best identiﬁed on T1-weighted images
and assessed on a combination of axial, sagittal and coronal
views. Despite a degree of overlap among disease subtypes,
some patterns of atrophy are indicative of speciﬁc underlying
pathology, however, such ﬁndings should be considered in the
context of the patient’s age and clinical examination. Figure 3
sets out an approach to the assessment of cerebral atrophy.

Focal lobar atrophy
Atrophy with a focal lobar predominance is a useful starting
point to help narrow the differential diagnosis in patients with
cognitive decline. In particular, an asymmetrical pattern of
atrophy (left greater than right or vice versa) or more anterior
than posterior atrophy, is more suggestive of underlying FTLD
pathology rather than AD pathology.
▸ Frontal lobe: Disproportionate frontal lobe atrophy is associated with FTLD pathology but does not differentiate
between different FTLD histopathologies (eg, Pick’s disease
or corticobasal degeneration (CBD)). Patients with behavioural variant FTD (bvFTD) may have symmetrical or asymmetrical frontal atrophy with or without additional temporal
lobe atrophy.44–46 Despite a typically asymmetric clinical
presentation, symmetrical frontal lobe atrophy is the predominant imaging ﬁnding in patients with dementia due to CBD
pathology.47–49 However, many patients with a clinical diagnosis of corticobasal syndrome are found to have pathology
other than CBD at postmortem,50 which may account for
some of the variability reported in the literature. Currently
imaging features are not included in the diagnostic criteria
for CBD.51 Left-sided posterior frontoinsular atrophy, which
may be limited to a subtle widening of the left sylvian ﬁssure,
is typically found in cases of progressive non-ﬂuent
aphasia44 52 (see ﬁgure 4).
▸ Temporal lobe: Asymmetric temporal atrophy is most commonly due to FTLD pathology but can also be due to AD.
The semantic dementia variant of FTD has a characteristic
pattern of loss: typically, left greater than right focal anterior
temporal atrophy particularly involving the temporal pole
(which progresses to ‘knife edge’ atrophy), the amygdala and
anterior hippocampus and often selective loss of anterior
fusiform gyrus, with relative preservation of more posterior
structures.44 45 52–54 Asymmetrical atrophy of the right temporal lobe with a similar distribution to SD may also occur,
most commonly presenting as bvFTD and often with additional features of prosopagnosia and/or topographical
memory impairment.55 While the asymmetry is usually dramatic in SD and the right temporal variant of bvFTD, both
temporal lobes usually become involved and over time the
pattern of atrophy may start to look more symmetrical (see
ﬁgure 4).45 56 57 Logopenic aphasia (LPA) is also associated
with greater left-sided atrophy in the temporal lobe although
in contrast to SD the pattern of atrophy extends more posteriorly than in SD, predominantly affecting the posterior perisylvian and temporoparietal areas (angular gyrus, posterior
middle temporal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus and superior
temporal sulcus) 44 58 (see ﬁgure 4). Unlike the majority of
clinical syndromes associated with an asymmetrical pattern of
atrophy, LPA is typically found to be a result of AD pathology.49 Nonetheless the presence of an anterior/posterior
atrophy gradient in the temporal lobe is suggestive of FTLD
rather than AD and can usefully be assessed by scrolling
696

posterior to anterior through coronal T1 slices of the temporal lobe.
▸ Parietal/Occipital lobe: Posterior cortical atrophy (PCA)
involving the parietal/occipital cortex is usually the result of
underlying AD pathology (see ﬁgure 4), however the differential diagnosis includes CBD, DLB and other less common
causes. PCA with additional medial temporal lobe (MTL)
atrophy supports AD as the most likely cause however the
MTL may initially be (relatively) spared in posterior variant
AD (PCA), especially in early-onset cases.59 Visual rating of
posterior atrophy in combination with MTL atrophy rating
has been reported to help discriminate AD from FTD and
AD from normal ageing with a sensitivity of 73% and speciﬁcity of 87%.60 Gross frontoparietal atrophy (extending into
the temporal lobe) conﬁned to a single hemisphere has been
described in patients with progranulin mutations and should
be considered in the presence of a strong family history.61–63

Focal hippocampal atrophy
Hippocampal atrophy is the most established imaging biomarker
of AD and as a result has now been incorporated in to diagnostic criteria.14 16 17 The sensitivity and speciﬁcity of visual rating of
MTL atrophy are approximately 80% when mild AD cases are
compared with elderly control subjects.64 Relative preservation of
the MTL is suggested as a means of distinguishing DLB from AD
at a group level,65 however this may not be true of older patients
or patients with advanced DLB and may not be reliable in individual cases66 (see ﬁgure 4), particularly as many patients with DLB
pathology also have AD pathology at postmortem.67 Dopamine
transporter imaging offers greater utility in distinguishing DLB
from AD.68 Hippocampal atrophy is also a feature of hippocampal sclerosis and hyperintensity of the hippocampus on T2 or
FLAIR images makes this diagnosis more likely. Focal (and often
severe) atrophy affecting the anteromedial temporal lobes has
been described in tau mutation (microtubule associated protein
tau (MAPT)) carriers, with striking loss of the amygdala, parahippocampus and hippocampal heads bilaterally62 63 69 (see ﬁgure 4).
Although more often asymmetrical, bvFTD may also demonstrate
symmetrical MTL atrophy and/or frontal lobe atrophy.45 56 57

Infratentorial atrophy
Progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) can present as a dementia,
often with frontal features or occasionally with progressive nonﬂuent aphasia. Midbrain atrophy is characteristic of PSP and has
been described as having a ‘hummingbird’ appearance in midsagittal slices (see ﬁgure 4), with axial slices demonstrating the so
called ‘mickey mouse’ sign. Other imaging features in PSP
include dilation of the third ventricle and atrophy of the red
nucleus.70 Frontal atrophy may be subtle or marked in PSP.
Pontocerebellar atrophy may indicate other neurodegenerative
conditions such as multiple system atrophy, which in rare cases
may present with a cognitive phenotype.19

Generalised atrophy
Global volume loss without focal lobar atrophy is a common
and non-speciﬁc ﬁnding on structural MRI studies in normal
ageing and dementia, and it can sometimes be difﬁcult to determine where normal ageing ends and pathological atrophy
begins. Symmetrical generalised atrophy (ie, left=right, anterior=posterior) is typically seen in AD and DLB, and may also
accompany white matter changes in patients with vascular
disease.

Neurodegeneration
No imaging abnormality demonstrated
When all stages fail to reveal any abnormalities, beyond what is
expected for age, the scan is reported as within normal limits.
This does not of course exclude dementia, nor does it rule out a
neurodegenerative cause particularly if the clinical syndrome is
mild. If clinical suspicion persists, a SPECT (single photon emission computed tomography) or PET scan can be helpful to look
for changes in cerebral perfusion/metabolism, or repeat MRI
scanning in 6–12 months. Normal imaging particularly with
repeat imaging after (greater than) 6 months should however
prompt consideration of a non-neurodegenerative cause including psychiatric conditions. In the future molecular diagnostic
indices such as CSF Aβ1–42 or amyloid PET scanning may
increasingly be used to conﬁrm or exclude the presence of AD
(amyloid) pathology in these cases.

CONCLUSION
Clinical diagnosis of the cause of cognitive complaints or
decline can be difﬁcult. Nonetheless accurate and timely diagnosis is increasingly important to guide management and to
provide appropriate information and support. As reﬂected in
current diagnostic guidelines, structural imaging can provide
valuable positive as well as negative predictive information and
the algorithm described here, based on reported imaging features with greatest diagnostic value, is designed to provide a systematic aid to help differentiate between the different causes of
dementia. It is of course important that imaging ﬁndings are
interpreted in the correct clinical context and that the limitations of making an individual diagnosis on the basis of imaging
ﬁndings are recognised.
While the diagnostic approach we describe here is based on
visual assessment of structural imaging, techniques such as volumetric quantiﬁcation of brain structures and automated classiﬁer
algorithms may play a complementary role in future clinical
practice. Brain volumetry is already used extensively in research
studies71 and clinical trials72 and has the potential to be used at
the single patient level to help support diagnosis and monitor
disease progression.73
In the meantime, structural imaging in cognitive cases can
provide easily accessible, clinically useful information that can
be realistically assessed by the non-specialist. Using a systematic
approach such as set out in this article may help clinicians in
evaluating their own scans, rather than relying on radiological
reports alone, and ultimately support the diagnostic process.
Further work is, however, required to evaluate the sensitivity
and speciﬁcity of imaging signatures for neurodegenerative
pathology.
