Abstract: Patients with Parkinson’s disease (PD) may present
impairment in cognitive functions even at early stages of the
disease. When compared with the general population, their
risk of dementia is ﬁve to six times higher. Recent investigations using structural MRI have shown that dementia in PD is
related to cortical structural changes and that speciﬁc cognitive dysfunctions can be attributed to atrophy in speciﬁc structures. We review the structural MRI studies carried out in PD
using either a manual region of interest (ROI) approach or
voxel-based morphometry (VBM). ROI studies have shown
that hippocampal volume is decreased in patients with PD
with and without dementia; in addition, hippocampal atrophy
correlated with deﬁcits in verbal memory. VBM studies have

demonstrated that dementia in PD involves structural changes
in limbic areas and widespread cortical atrophy. Findings in
nondemented patients with PD are less conclusive, possibly
because cognitively heterogeneous groups of patients have
been studied. Patients with PD with cognitive impairment
and/or visual hallucinations present greater brain atrophy than
patients without these characteristics. These ﬁndings suggest
that cortical atrophy is related to cognitive dysfunction in PD
and precedes the development of dementia. Structural MRI
might therefore provide an early marker for dementia in
PD. Ó 2009 Movement Disorder Society

Parkinson’s disease (PD) has traditionally been considered as a motor disorder. However, cognitive dysfunctions are known to occur even at early stages1 and
most patients develop dementia over the course of the
disease.2 Dementia in PD was initially described as
subcortical, and cognitive dysfunctions in nondemented
patients have been attributed to dopaminergic depletion
affecting the fronto-striatal circuit3 or the dopamine-acetylcholine synaptic imbalance.4 Nevertheless, recent
investigations using MRI suggest that speciﬁc cogni-

tive deﬁcits, such as memory deﬁcits, and dementia in
PD may also be explained by cortical structural
changes. The methods most widely used to assess
structural MRI changes in PD have been region of interest (ROI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM).
The ROI method consists in measuring manually
delineated and anatomically deﬁned regions within the
brain based on an a priori hypothesis. ROI approach
takes into consideration the variability across subjects,
but as it also depends on the subjective criteria of the
investigator, time-consuming inter and intrarater validations are mandatory. VBM is a fully automated
whole brain measurement technique that maps the statistical probability of differences in regional tissue volume or density between groups.5 It provides a nonbiased measure of regions that may be neglected in
hypothesis-based studies using ROI. However, the normalization stage within the VBM analysis, which is
required to ensure that the same brain regions can be

compared between subjects, transforms the shape of
the brain image and may distort the abnormal tissue
and artiﬁcially inﬂate the atrophied areas.6 Other structural techniques that have proved successful in detecting atrophy are surface-based and 3D-modeling analyses,7,8 but they have not been used to date in PD.
In this study, we review structural MRI ﬁndings
using manual ROI and VBM in patients with PD with
dementia, patients with PD without dementia, and nondemented patients with PD with neuropsychological
impairment and/or hallucinations who are therefore at
risk of developing dementia.
MRI STUDIES IN PATIENTS WITH PD WITH
DEMENTIA
Manual ROI studies in patients with PD have mainly
focused on medial temporal lobe structures because
these areas are known to present atrophy in other
dementias such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and because differences in the degree of atrophy between dementias may
have important implications for diagnosis.9,10 Atrophy
of the hippocampus11–14 and amygdala13,14 has been
reported in PD with dementia, remaining statistically
signiﬁcant after controlling for global cerebral volume.
In addition, reduced entorhinal cortex volume has been
reported in patients with PD with dementia when compared with controls.15 Medial temporal lobe atrophy is
encountered in AD,16 but studies in PD with dementia
show that atrophy in medial temporal lobe areas may
also underlie dementia in PD.
In a previous study using VBM, we observed that
patients with PD with dementia showed gray matter
loss in hippocampus, parahippocampus, and anterior
cingulate gyrus as well as the basal ganglia in comparison with healthy controls.17 Interestingly, the hippocampus18,19 and cingulate gyrus20,21 are known to be
major targets for Lewy body (LB) inclusions in PD.
Another VBM study with a large number of patients
provided further evidence of medial temporal and basal
ganglia atrophy, but also reported greater widespread
neocortical atrophy.22 In that study, atrophy of the
medial temporal lobe structures was more pronounced
in AD than in demented PD and there were no differences between DLB and PD with dementia. However,
another group has recently reported that patients with
DLB showed greater neocortical atrophy than patients
with PD with dementia in the temporal, parietal, and
occipital lobes.23
The degree of atrophy in demented patients with PD
may vary depending on the time of the occurrence of

S749

dementia in the course of the disease (i.e., early or
late).24 Early development of dementia has been associated with more severe degeneration of cortical and
subcortical structures in neuropathological25 and neuroimaging studies.24 Overall, neuroimaging studies are in
agreement with ﬁndings in postmortem neuropathological studies in demented PD, which report morphological changes in limbic18,19 and neocortical areas19–21
and have the advantage of assessing these changes in
vivo. The fact that changes in medial temporal lobe
areas are common to dementia in PD and to other neurodegenerative diseases such as AD and DLB raises
the question of whether AD or cortical LB type
changes underlie cognitive dysfunctions in PD26;
unfortunately, the structural MRI neuroimaging techniques reviewed in this work are still some way from
resolving this matter.
MRI STUDIES IN PATIENTS WITH PD
WITHOUT DEMENTIA
The ﬁrst study using a manual ROI approach11 to
assess the hippocampus in nondemented patients with
PD reported decreased hippocampal volume in patients
with PD without dementia when compared with controls. However, these results should be viewed with
caution, because some patients may have met criteria
for mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but it was not
detected. Another study12 looked for differences in
several structures including the hippocampus, parahippocampus, temporal lobe, frontal lobe, and parietooccipital areas, ﬁnding that only corrected hippocampal
volumes differed in nondemented patients with PD and
controls (P 5 0.004), even though the effect size for
nondemented patients with PD was only 0.66 when
compared with effect sizes of 1.22 and 1.81 for
demented PD and AD groups, respectively. It has also
been reported that nondemented patients with PD presented volume reductions of 11% in the amygdala and
10% in the hippocampus when compared with controls; volumes of both structures in nondemented
patients with PD had values between those of
demented patients and controls, although the differences did not reach statistical signiﬁcance.13 In addition,
signiﬁcant age-associated hippocampal atrophy in PD
was found in one study in which hippocampal volumes
in old (>70) nondemented patients differed from controls, but not in younger cases.14
Studies using visual evaluation of atrophy27 in PD,
in which a score of zero represented absence of atrophy and a score of four high severity, reported that
early stage nonmedicated patients with PD had atrophy

in the bilateral prefrontal cortex and hippocampus. The
right hippocampus atrophy score was 1.15 in PD versus 0.45 in controls, and the left hippocampus score
was 1.05 in PD versus 0.64 in controls.28 Another
study from the same group29 in a sample of nondemented patients with PD but at a more advanced stage
of the disease and with impairment in several cognitive
domains also reported atrophy in the hippocampus and
the prefrontal cortex when compared with controls.
Rated visually, more severe medial temporal atrophy
has also been reported in patients with PD versus controls, but less than in subjects with DLB and AD.30
Results of VBM studies in patients with PD without
dementia are heterogeneous, but most ﬁndings suggest
the involvement of neocortical areas. In these patients,
atrophy has been reported in caudate nucleus,31 frontal
areas and insula,22 prefrontal cortex and parahippocampus,32 hippocampus and anterior cingulate,17 left intraparietal sulcus,33 superior temporal and frontal
gyrus,34,35 and cerebellum.36 A possible explanation
for this high variability might be the heterogeneous
characteristics of patients with PD who are often considered as one uniform group, without differentiating
between cognitively intact patients and those with neuropsychological deﬁcits or with hallucinations.
MRI IN PATIENTS WITH PD WITH
COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT AND
HALLUCINATIONS
Cognitive impairment is common even in newly diagnosed patients with PD, occurring in 25 to 30% of
cases.1 Patients with cognitive deﬁcits have an increased
risk of developing dementia.37,38 One study found that
patients with PD with MCI diagnosis according to the
criteria proposed by Petersen et al.39 had gray matter
reductions in temporal and frontal areas when compared
with patients without MCI.35 Another imaging study that
identiﬁed MCI subtypes before conversion to various
kinds of dementia found that the subtype most closely
associated with conversion to dementia in PD was characterized by third ventricular enlargement and similar,
though less severe, atrophy of the medial temporal lobe
when compared with patients with MCI who converted
to AD. Corrected hippocampal volumes in patients with
MCI converting to AD were 0.084 mm3 (left) and 0.078
mm3 (right) when compared with values of 0.109 mm3
(left) and 0.099 mm3 (right) in patients with MCI converting to PD.40 Unfortunately, MCI criteria for PD are
not well deﬁned and modiﬁed criteria used for AD39
have mainly been used for the diagnosis. New criteria
have recently been proposed for the diagnosis of demen-

Movement Disorders, Vol. 24, Suppl. 2, 2009

tia in PD,41 and similar efforts should be made to create
standardized criteria for MCI diagnosis in this condition.
Patients with visual hallucinations (VHs) present
greater neuropsychological impairment in domains such
as verbal memory, language, semantic ﬂuency, and
visuoperceptive functions than those without.42–44 Longitudinal studies have pointed out the presence of VH as
a predictor of dementia in PD.45–47 We found that nondemented patients with PD with VH had gray matter
loss in occipito-parietal regions when compared with
patients without VH34 and also presented hippocampal
atrophy when compared with healthy controls.48 These
results suggest that pathological changes occurring in
PD with VH are more marked and severe than those
occurring in nonhallucinating patients with PD. As in
AD,7 hippocampal atrophy mainly affected the head of
the structure and correlated with verbal memory.48
Smaller hippocampal volumes and speciﬁcally the
involvement of the hippocampal head have been identiﬁed as predictors of conversion to dementia in AD.8 The
same may apply to PD; in this initially nondemented
sample of patients with PD with VH, nearly half met the
criteria for dementia after 1 year follow-up.49
Manual ROI studies also provide evidence that speciﬁc cognitive deﬁcits are related to speciﬁc structural
changes in PD. Hippocampus volumes have been
reported to correlate with memory scores12–14,28,29 and
overall cognitive performance scores,12,13 but not with
frontal functions.50 In addition, amygdalar volumes
have been reported to correlate with scores on these
cognitive tests.13,14 The atrophy of medial temporal
structures probably runs in parallel and may underlie
the memory dysfunctions associated with PD.
LONGITUDINAL MRI STUDIES IN PATIENTS
WITH PD
The progression of regional brain atrophy with
VBM in PD has only been investigated in two studies.51,52 The ﬁrst study showed limbic and temporooccipital areas of gray matter reduction after a 25month follow-up,51 but the other study found no areas
of gray matter loss in patients with PD after a followup period of 1.4 years.52 The differences in these
results may be explained by longer disease duration,
increased age of patients, more prolonged follow-up,
and use of uncorrected P values in the study in which
atrophy was documented. In agreement with the ﬁrst
study, an earlier report by Hu et al.53 found that annual
brain volume loss was greater in patients with PD than
in controls and these changes correlated with cognitive
decline. However, other serial MRI studies using meas-

MRI AND COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT IN PD
ures of global atrophy for monitoring disease progression reported no differences in atrophy rates between
controls and nondemented patients with PD,54,55 but
found signiﬁcantly increased atrophy in patients with
PD with dementia when compared with nondemented
patients with PD and controls.54
Longitudinal MRI studies should focus on tracking
regional cortical changes in PD. Neuropathological
studies in PD have proposed a six-stage system56 of
brain pathology to indicate a predictable sequence of
ascending lesions that correlates with neurological deﬁcits in the majority of patients with early onset and
long duration of the disease, but this classiﬁcation often fails to correlate with clinical severity and dementia in PD.57 MRI studies permit assessment of morphological changes in vivo, allowing us to establish where
morphological changes begin, and for which kind of
patients these changes become more marked and which
ones remain stable over time. Furthermore, if the areas
that suffer the most atrophy over time are related to
cognitive dysfunctions that lead to dementia, we would
be able to determine objective markers for the development of dementia and provide evidence of therapeutic
effect when modifying treatments related to the onset
of dementia are available.
CONCLUSIONS
MRI studies have reported cortical atrophy in PD.
ROI imaging studies have shown reduced hippocampal
and amygdala volumes even in nondemented patients,
and atrophy in these structures has been related to
overall cognitive performance and memory deﬁcits in
PD. VBM studies have demonstrated that patients with
PD with dementia present limbic and widespread neocortical gray matter loss, whereas patients with PD
without dementia mainly present atrophy in frontal and
temporal areas. Nondemented patients with PD with a
higher risk of developing dementia, for example those
with cognitive impairment and/or VHs, show greater
atrophy than patients who do not present these risk factors. The involvement of the hippocampus in patients
with PD with cognitive deﬁcits has been identiﬁed in
both ROI and VBM studies. Evidence of neocortical
involvement is currently available only from whole
brain VBM studies because to date no ROI studies
have focused on the relationship between speciﬁc neocortical regions and cognitive domains. Overall, these
ﬁndings suggest that cortical atrophy is related to cognitive dysfunction in PD and precedes the development
of dementia. Cortical atrophy assessed by MRI may
therefore be a useful early marker for the development

S751

of dementia in PD. The imaging ﬁndings reviewed
here suggest that the term ‘‘subcortical dementia’’ is
not adequate to describe the dementia occurring in PD.
However, it should be borne in mind that the results
from MRI structural studies in PD vary widely. The
main problems are as follows: (1) the heterogeneity of
samples studied; it is not always well deﬁned whether
the patients with PD included present cognitive deﬁcits
and/or psychiatric symptoms, and in fact the criteria
used to diagnose dementia vary from study to study;
(2) the inconsistency in applying correction for global
cerebral volume in whole brain VBM and ROI studies;
and (3) the inconsistency in the protocol used in VBM:
optimized versus classical protocols, use of modulated
versus unmodulated images, and the size of the Gaussian kernel in the smoothing.
To overcome these difﬁculties, we make the following recommendations: (1) cognitive and psychiatric
symptoms in the sample should be deﬁned using the
criteria proposed by the Movement Disorder Task
Force for the diagnosis of dementia in PD; (2) both
raw and corrected volumes of the selected structures
should be reported in ROI studies; (3) the standard
guidelines58 for reporting VBM studies should be followed, and a modulation of gray matter volume should
be used based on the warping applied during normalization so as to minimize the danger of distortion. We
also favor the use of the recently developed Diffeomorphic Anatomical Registration Through Exponentiated Lie Algebra (DARTEL) algorithm, a nonlinear
warping technique to minimize structural variation
between subjects.59
Major challenges that remain in the ﬁeld of MRI
structural studies in PD are the need to establish patterns
of atrophy that can predict different disease outcomes
and to combine their use with other approaches, such as
PET studies, using different tracers (FDG, MPPF, and
FDDNP) to determine the etiopathogenesis of PD.
