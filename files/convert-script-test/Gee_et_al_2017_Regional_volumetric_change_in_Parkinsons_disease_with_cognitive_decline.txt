Background: Parkinson's disease (PD), characterized by motor dysfunction and cognitive decline, may demonstrate speciﬁc patterns of brain atrophy. Although cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies
show correlation between regional brain volume loss and cognitive impairment, there is only scarce evidence
from longitudinal studies validating the link between cognition and brain anatomy in PD.
Objective: To test the relationship between magnitude and spatial extent of atrophy in PD patients with progressive, signiﬁcant cognitive decline and dementia (PDD).
Methods: We followed thirty-three initially non-demented patients with prevalent PD for three years while monitoring cognitive function and brain atrophy. Longitudinally acquired T1-weighted magnetic resonance images
were analyzed in the voxel-based morphometry framework of SPM.
Results: Groups did not differ signiﬁcantly with respect to age or gender. More males developed PDD (7 males, 3
females) compared to those remaining intact (12 males, 11 females). Clusters of lower grey matter volume were
found in PDD compared to PD in left uncus at baseline and an expanded region that included the left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus at 36 months. The cognitive status by scan interaction showed differential
changes between groups in the right insula. At a more liberal statistical threshold we observed changes in the
right insula and bilateral hippocampi as well as the right cuneus additional to the lower brain stem.
Conclusions: Region speciﬁc atrophy, consistent with the pattern of cortical Lewy body deposition seen in autopsy
studies, can be detected with MRI in PD patients with signiﬁcant cognitive decline. MRI may be useful for tracking
cognitive decline in PD.

1. Introduction
Parkinson's disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative
movement disorder, and is characterized by loss of dopaminergic
nigrostriatal projections; however, over time more generalized pathology leads to widespread neurodegeneration [1], which leads to signiﬁcant loss of motor response to dopamine replacement, cognitive
decline and dementia [2,3,4]. The latter are the major determinants on
nursing home placement and increased mortality [5,6]. The neurologic
bases for these changes are not fully understood. Imaging biomarkers
might assist in tracking pathological changes, in predication of dementia
and in development of treatments. Magnetic resonance imaging may be
one such approach that is readily available [7,8].

Patients with PD with dementia (PDD) have progressive atrophy on
MRI [9,10] that likely begins with mild cognitive impairment, which occurs in at least 24% of patients [11] prior to signiﬁcant cognitive decline.
Recent studies show that longitudinal cortical grey matter changes
occur in incident/early Parkinson's disease cases [12,13,14,15,16].
These ﬁndings are consistent with prior studies that suggest that subtle
changes occur prior to overt cognitive decline [17,18] and can be detected in prevalent cases [19]. Grey matter atrophy rates may depend on
duration of disease [20] and can complement other biomarkers of
change [21].
We have shown that whole brain atrophy and ventricular enlargement occur in older patients with PD developing incident dementia or
signiﬁcant cognitive decline [22] and might be accelerated in patients
with hyper-homocysteinemia [23]. In the current study we analyze
this same cohort for regional changes in brain atrophy using state-ofthe-art optimized voxel-based morphometry to test for more focal
changes driving the previously observed whole-brain atrophy and ventricular dilations. We hypothesized that atrophy is localized in a pattern

consistent with reported pathological Lewy body changes in the anterior cingulate, insula and medial temporal lobes [24].
2. Methods
Subject selection and follow up has been described in detail previously [22]. In brief, 33 subjects with PD, meeting criteria consistent
with UK brain bank criteria according to a movement disorders specialist [25] achieving 36-month follow up are included here. All subjects
were assessed at 0, 18 and 36 months.
Baseline age, sex, education and other demographic features were
measured. As previously described, at baseline and every 18 months
Mini-Mental Status Examination (MMSE), Frontal Assessment Battery
(FAB), Dementia Rating Scale (DRS-II), the 15-item Geriatric Depression
scale (GDS) were scored [22]. The short Blessed-Orientation-Concentration Test, FAB and a general and neurological examination (including
rating the Uniﬁed Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS), Part III)
were performed by a neurologist (RC) who recorded co-morbid medical
conditions (Cumulative Illness Rating Scale (CIRS)) [22]. Levodopa
equivalent doses were calculated as previously described. Assessments
of PD patients were performed in the ON state.
2.1. Dementia classiﬁcation
Patients were classiﬁed as previously described [22]. Subject and
caregiver-derived Clinical Dementia Ratings scores (CDR, and CCDR)
were obtained as previously described [26]. Dementia was deﬁned as
cognitive impairment in two domains with functional impairment due
to cognitive decline based on all available information, independent of
neuro-imaging. Memory impairment was not necessary (i.e., modiﬁed
from DSM-IV which was available at the time of study inception) [27].
Participants with signiﬁcant cognitive or functional decline (on the
MMSE, DRS or CDR or CCDR) were considered impaired (PDD). Subjects
with questionable changes in cognitive function, or without functional
impairment, were grouped with non-impaired subjects (PDND).
2.2. MR imaging
Images were acquired on a Siemens Sonata 1.5T system between December 2004 and August 2009. T1-weighted images were obtained
using a 3-D magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo sequence (MPRAGE) (TR = 1800 ms, TE = 3.2 ms, TI = 1100 ms, 1 average, ﬂip angle = 15°, ﬁeld of view (FOV) = 256 mm, image matrix =
256 × 256, 128 slices, 1.5 mm slices) with image slices oriented perpendicular to the AC-PC line. Native spatial resolution was 1 × 1 × 1.5 mm
which was zero-ﬁlled to 0.5 × 0.5 × 1.5 mm. Standard axial FLAIR images (TR = 8000 ms, TE = 99 ms, 2 averages, FOV = 220 mm, 25 slices,
5 mm slice thickness) oriented to the inferior margin of the corpus
callosum were used to examine white matter changes and exclude
pathological lesions as previously described [22].
2.3. Intracranial volumes
Intracranial volumes (ICV) were measured from the T1-weighted images using the program DISPLAY (Montreal Neurological Institute, Quebec,
Canada (http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/ServicesSoftwareVisualization/
HomePage) as previously described [22]. The intracranial volumes were
used to correct the grey and white matter volumes for individual
differences.

2.5. Voxel-based morphometry
Image processing was done using the VBM8 (r435) toolbox (http://
dbm.neuro.uni-jena.de/vbm/) for longitudinal data in SPM8 running in
Matlab 7.8.0. In VBM8 toolbox, the 18 month and 36 month volumes
were initially realigned to the baseline volume, then a mean image
was created and the three volumes realigned again to the mean
image. All three volumes were then bias corrected and segmented
into GM, WM and CSF. Spatial normalization parameters were obtained
from the baseline image using the DARTEL (Diffeomorphic Anatomical
Registration using Exponentiated Lie algebra) [28] toolbox and applied
to all three volumes. The standard template images provided by the
VBM8 toolbox, based on the MNI152 average brain, were used for spatial normalization. The VBM8 toolbox for longitudinal image processing
produces unmodulated tissue segment volumes, hence changes observed represent tissue concentration and not tissue volumes [29,30].
An 8 mm Gaussian smoothing kernel was applied prior to statistical
analysis. SPM8 was used for both cross-sectional and longitudinal comparisons. The comparisons between PDND and PDD groups at baseline
and 36 months, were modeled using two between group factors, dementia status and gender. To examine changes with respect to time, a
ﬂexible factorial model was used, with dementia status and gender as
between subject factors and scan time (baseline, 18 month, and
36 month) as a within subject factor. The interaction between dementia
classiﬁcation and scan time was examined, to see if and where the two
groups changed differently over time. Baseline age and intracranial volume (ICV) were also included in all models. For cluster-level inference
[31,32], a cluster-deﬁning threshold of uncorrected p b 0.001 was
used, with the non-stationarity adjustment [33], which accounts for differences in smoothness in the images. The threshold cluster size that
corresponded to FWE cluster level corrected p-value b 0.05 was then
used to ﬁlter the results. Only signiﬁcant clusters are displayed in the
ﬁgures. Additionally, to test for more focal but stronger effects a voxelwise family wise error [34] (FWE) corrected p-value b 0.05 was applied.
3. Results
There were no signiﬁcant baseline demographic or clinical differences at baseline between those who became cognitively impaired
and those who remained intact as shown in Table 1. The 36-month
data have been reported previously [22].
3.1. Voxel-based morphometry
Contrasting dementia groups at baseline yielded no between-group
voxel-based differences at a peak FWE-corrected signiﬁcance of
p b 0.05. Examining clusters, we found a signiﬁcant cluster of decreased
grey matter density in the left uncus (Brodmann area 38) (Fig. 1 and
Table 2). At 36 months, a much larger cluster that also included the
left hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus was evident (Fig. 2 and
Table 2).
Examining the dementia by time interaction, a signiﬁcant cluster of
accelerated atrophy in PDD compared to PDND was found on the right
insula with a peak FWE p-corrected threshold of p b 0.05 (Fig. 3). The
maximum t-statistic is located at (33, −21, 19) mm in Talairach space
with a cluster extent of 133 voxels. Using a cluster level threshold at
FWE p-corrected b0.05, signiﬁcant clusters were identiﬁed in the right
insula, and right and left hippocampus as well as low in the brain
stem, indicating accelerated atrophy in these areas for PDD patients
(Table 3 and Fig. 4).

2.4. Statistical analysis of baseline characteristics

4. Discussion

Groups were compared using Chi-square or ANOVA as appropriate
using SPSS 20 (Armonk, NY). Statistical thresholds were set at p b 0.05.

Here we show that there are clear differences in brain volume and
the rate of atrophy progression between PD patients showing

signiﬁcant cognitive decline compared to those remaining cognitively
stable. Our previous study showed that simple to obtain global measures can be used to reliably track decline [22]. Here we demonstrate
that the focal nature of these changes is consistent with regions that
have been shown to be affected at autopsy and correlate with cognitive
status [24]. The summation of these changes likely leads to global
change as reﬂected in ventricular dilatation.
Among the earlier longitudinal studies one showed an increased rate
of atrophy in PDD with no difference in the rate of atrophy between cognitively intact PD patients and controls [9] contrasting with another
study that found atrophy in both PD and PDD using VBM [10]. PD patients with hallucinations, who are at risk for dementia, have been
shown to have focal atrophy [35]. Longitudinal volumetric scans with
patients grouped according to smell abnormalities (another potential
risk factor for dementia) rather than cognitive decline [36] showed
that group with normal olfaction, showed progressive changes in the
right amygdala and bilateral temporal lobes. Recent studies suggest
that progressive cortical thinning is likely accelerated in patients with
mild cognitive impairment, [37] and may be associated with incident
MCI [13]. In addition to areas we show to be involved, progressive
changes can be seen in more widespread cortical areas including the
temporal, parietal and frontal lobes and deep structures such as the
thalamus and basal ganglia [38]. Differences between studies are likely
based on imaging methods and characteristic of the subjects. Our

study highlights the utility of brain MRI to track cognitive decline in a
typical treated patient population in agreement with Melzer et al. [19].
A weakness of our study includes its relatively small sample size with
only 10 incident signiﬁcant cognitive decline/dementia subjects. On the
other hand a strength is the systematic longitudinal follow up. We did
not use currently proposed PD dementia criteria, which are still being validated [39] since they were not available at the time of study inception,
rather we used modiﬁed DSM-IV criteria (not requiring memory impairment). Our grouping is likely clinically meaningful, however, given the
fact that cognitive decline correlated strongly with atrophy in our previous study [22] and that functional decline related to cognitive impairment
was evident in our subjects. It should be acknowledged that the pathological contributions to cognitive decline in Parkinson's disease may be

would include more subjects to allow better matching and include more

we excluded patients with dementia and hence our study, which is clinic
based, is likely a selected group.

The use of cluster level inference limits the ability to be precise about
the affected regions in the brain [32]. In our case, for example, we were
able to specify a particular region in the right insula where GM atrophy
is accelerated in PDD compared to PDND using peak level inference.
When we used cluster level inference, a larger cluster in the right
insula as well as clusters in the hippocampi and brain stem are revealed; however we cannot specify where within these structures
these changes are occurring. We identiﬁed a cluster [41] in the
brainstem that showed atrophy consistent with a previous study, potentially consistent with pathological progression as hypothesized
by Braak et al. [1].
Our study examined subjects who are at high risk for dementia,
by virtue of age and examined incident signiﬁcant cognitive decline
and dementia. This suggests that MRI imaging can be used to track
the onset of meaningful decline. There is some evidence that atrophy
may be reversible with interventions such as mindfulness therapy
[42], suggesting that MRI may be useful as a biomarker in intervention studies. The correspondence of the areas of change with pathologic data gives support to the notion that the ﬁndings are
biologically meaningful. Clearly future studies should follow patients
to autopsy to see if there is a correspondence between imaging ﬁndings and autopsy ﬁndings. Our data add further support to the notion
that MRI detects meaningful changes, which can complement other
biomarkers in predicting and tracking cognitive decline in Lewy
body diseases.
