Abstract.
Background: The influence of neuroinflammation on neuronal function and hippocampal atrophy in Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD) is still unclear.
Objectives: Here we investigated whether microglial activation measured by [11 C]PK11195 PET is associated with neuronal
function measured by cerebral glucose metabolic rate (rCMRGlc) using FDG-PET and hippocampal volume measurements.
Methods: We enrolled 25 subjects (9 PDD, 8 AD, and 8 controls) who underwent PET scans with [11 C](R)PK11195,
[18 F]FDG, and volumetric MRI scanning.
Results: SPM correlation analysis in AD and PDD showed a negative correlation between hippocampal volume and microglial
activation within hippocampus or parahippocampus and with cortical and subcortical areas of projections from hippocampus,
while there was a positive correlation between rCMRGlc in cortical and subcortical areas of projections from hippocampus
and hippocampal volume. Hippocampal volume was significantly reduced in AD compared to controls but not in PDD.
Conclusions: These findings indicate that microglial activation inversely correlated with hippocampal volume and hippocampal rCMRGlc in neurodegenerative diseases with dementia, providing further evidence for the central role of microglial
activation in neurodegenerative diseases.

neuroinflammation plays a significant role in neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease
(AD) and Parkinson’s disease dementia (PDD),
whether neuroinflammation is associated with local
and distant neuronal damage is still not being investigated. Microglial cells are the resident macrophages
of the central nervous system (CNS); they represent around 10% of the CNS population and play a
crucial role in first line of immune defense in case
of any kind of brain injury. They have the capability to phagocyte toxic products, release cytotoxic

factors, and can be antigen-presenting cells [1]. In
absence of foreign stimuli, microglial cells are in a
“resting” state, or inactivated; however, with ramified morphology, microglia can scan close regions
and their environment without interfering with neurons and neuronal activities and can monitor the brain
parenchyma every few hours. When activated, they
go through morphological changes, converting their
shape to an activated amoeboid and mobile one, able
to reach the site of injury [2]. These cells can remain
for a long time in the activated phenotype, releasing
cytokines and neurotoxic agents that can worsen CNS
damage [3]. The acute CNS inflammatory response
to an injury mediated by microglia can be protective;
however, chronic inflammatory activity can be selfsustaining beyond physiological usefulness resulting
in damage to the affected tissues [4]. In AD, ␤-fibrils
activate microglia, and it is supported by the presence of microglia around the plaques, while in PDD,
activated microglia is associated with ␣-synuclein.
Microglial activation, as visualized by PET scans
using the radioligand [11 C](R)PK11195 that targets
the translocator protein (TSPO), is present in patients
with AD and PD [5, 6]. It has also been shown that
there is a strong association with amyloid deposition
in AD [7].
Cerebral glucose metabolic rate (rCMRGlc) measured by [18 F]FDG PET is measure of glucose
utilization, and is suggested to be an indirect measure of synaptic function. Hippocampal atrophy is
a characteristic feature of AD, and it is established
that accelerated hippocampal atrophy is associated
with disease progression [8]. The presence of hippocampal atrophy in PDD is more variable; some
groups have reported hippocampal atrophy in PD at
an early stage of the disease [9–12], while others
were not able to replicate those findings [13]. Here,
we hypothesized that regional and distant microglial
activation is associated with hippocampal volume
loss in subjects with AD and PDD, and this could
be associated with reduction in rCMRGlc. Our aim
was to investigate whether increased hippocampal,
medial temporal lobe, or whole cortex glial activation, where hippocampal neurons projects directly or
indirectly, correlates with hippocampal volume loss
and reduction in glucose metabolism in hippocampus
and medial temporal lobe structures. In this study,
we evaluated glial activation using [11 C]PK11195
PET and rCMRGlc using [18 F]FDG PET with arterial input. Hippocampal volume was measured from
T1 volumetric MRI in patients with AD, PDD and
age-matched control subjects.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
Twenty-five subjects (nine PDD, eight AD, and
eight controls) were recruited from Imperial College London Healthcare NHS Trust and associated
hospitals in London. All subjects had detailed clinical and neurological assessments, including collateral
history as required, bloods and detailed neuropsychometric evaluation, assessing verbal and visual memory, attention, executive functions, visuoconstruction,
language, and recognition memory. Subjects were
diagnosed as clinically probable AD based on the
NINDS-ADRDA criteria [14]. Diagnosis of PDD was
based on the diagnostic algorithm for PDD [15], where
patients had a diagnosis of PD for at least 1 year
before the onset of dementia. The inclusion criteria for
patients were: (1) age 50–80 years, (2) clinical diagnosis of AD or PDD before they enrolled in the study,
(3) adequate visual and auditory acuity to complete
the neuropsychometric testing, (4) a reliable caregiver
who could provide information about the patient’s
clinical symptoms, and (5) ability to provide informed
consent. Exclusion criteria were the presence of: (1)
extensive white matter microvascular disease on MRI
which was over and above the lacunes associated with
normal aging, (2) major depression based on DSMIV criteria, (3) a current or recent history of drug or
alcohol abuse/dependence, (4) any significant disease
or unstable medical condition that could influence
neuropsychological testing, (5) pregnancy, (6) any
contraindications to MRI, (7) a history of schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, bipolar disorder, or any
history of electroconvulsive therapy, and (8) history
of cancer within the past 5 years except localized
skin and prostate cancer. Dementia was excluded in
control subjects by detailed clinical examination and
neuropsychometric tests. None of the enrolled subjects had diabetes or chronic kidney disease stage 3
and above. Two AD and one PDD subjects suffered
from ischemic heart disease. None of the enrolled
volunteers was on treatment for acute or chronic systemic inflammatory diseases. All patients underwent
PET scans with [11 C]PK11195 PET and [18 F]FDG
PET with arterial input as well as volumetric MRI
scanning, after obtaining regulatory approval from
the Ethics Committee of the Hammersmith Hospitals NHS Trust. Permission to administer radiotracers
was obtained from the Administration of Radioactive
Substances Advisory Committee (ARSAC), UK. The
work described has been carried out in accordance

G.D. Femminella et al. / Hippocampal Volume and Neuroinﬂammation

with The Code of Ethics of the World Medical Association (Declaration of Helsinki) and written informed
consent was obtained by all participants. All subjects
were age-matched AD and PDD subjects under 80
years.
MRI and PET scanning
MRI scanning
MRI scans were performed with a 1.5 Tesla GE
scanner. T1 volumetric MRI (3D T1 volume, pulse
sequence RF-Fast, acquisition times TR 30 ms, TE
3 ms, flip angle 30◦ , FOV 25 cm, matrix 156 ×
256, voxel dimensions 0.98 × 0.98 × 1.6 mm) were
acquired for co-registration of PET scans and assessment of atrophy, while T2 weighted images were
acquired to rule out any structural abnormality in AD,
PDD, and control subjects.
Evaluation of hippocampal volume using
FreeSurfer
Automated hippocampal segmentation was
done using FreeSurfer5.1.0 (http://surfer.nmr.mgh.
harvard.edu/). The stages of FreeSurfer’s volumebased subcortical stream are as fully described
before [16, 17]. Briefly, an affine registration with
Talairach space is followed by an initial volumetric
labeling and correction for variation in intensity due
to the B1 biasfield. After this, a high dimensional
nonlinear volumetric alignment to the Talairach
atlas is performed, followed by pre-processing, and
finally the volume is labeled. Hippocampal volume
was calculated by multiplying the number of voxels
by the voxel volume.
PET scanning
[11 C](R)PK11195 PET. All subjects underwent
three-dimensional [11 C](R)PK11195 PET using an
ECAT EXACT HR++ (CTI/Siemens 966) scanner
where a mean dose of 296(±18) MBq was injected,
and 3D emission data was acquired in listmode over
60 min. Parametric images of [11 C](R)PK11195
binding potential (BPND ), reflecting Bmax/Kd, were
generated with a simplified tissue reference two
brain compartmental model (SRTM). As AD and
PDD subjects have a widespread distribution of
pathological changes, no single region free of disease
can be identified as a reference for non-specific tracer
binding. This is due to the fact that (1) immunocytochemical study indicated TSPO is present in the
cerebellum [18]; (2) TSPO is also present in arteries,
meninges, choroid plexus, and in the ependymal

1277

cells, thus specific signal could be affected by the
anatomical reference region even in healthy control
subjects; and (3) with arterial input analysis, we have
demonstrated that there is signal in cerebellum in
AD subjects. Cluster analysis was, therefore, used
to extract and identify a distributed cluster of voxels
that mirrored a normal population cortical reference
input function for each individual subject (controls,
AD, and PDD). We have introduced this computational methodology that enables the extraction of a
reference cluster from [11 C](R)PK11195 dynamic
PET studies [18]. The algorithm matches the time
activity curve (TAC) of each pixel to the kinetics
of six pre-defined tissues (normal grey and normal
white matter, skull, muscle, grey matter with reactive
microglia, vasculature that is rich in the receptor
in endothelial cells and smooth muscles) obtained
from a database of control subjects and patients.
The reference TAC is calculated as the population
average of normal grey matter. The clustering code
is implemented in the software package SUPERPK
(Imperial Innovations, Imperial College London)
written in Matlab (The Mathworks Inc., Natick MA).
The use of an appropriate reference not only increases
the sensitivity of the quantification procedure to the
specific signal from microglia but also minimizes
the sensitivity of the calculated binding potential
(BPND ), obtained by the modeling procedure, to
changes in blood flow. Our unit has validated the use
of the SRTM with a reference input function defined
by cluster analysis as the most reproducible and
sensitive technique for generating BPND maps [19].
[18 F]FDG-PET. All subjects underwent [18 F]FDGPET scans using a Siemens ECAT EXACT HR+
scanner. Subjects were asked to fast for 4 h before
the injection of [18 F]FDG (186 ± 8 MBq). The FDG
dynamic emission scan was acquired over 60 min
with continuous online whole blood sampling for the
first 15 min while discrete whole blood and plasma
samples were taken at 5, 10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, and
60 min. All subjects had radial artery cannulation and
fasting plasma glucose levels were measured at the
beginning and end of the scan. Parametric maps of
absolute rCMRGlc were created by applying spectral analysis to brain time activity curves using an
arterial plasma input function [7].
Region of interest analysis
Region of interest (ROI) analysis was done for
parametric images of [11 C](R)PK11195 BPND and

1278

rCMRGlc. Initially, an individualized object map was
created for all the subjects using the following procedure. Statistical parametric mapping software (SPM8)
was used to spatially transform individual PET images
into their corresponding MRI space by: (1) segmenting individual MRIs into grey matter, white matter
and CSF, (2) thresholding voxels with a >50% probability of containing grey matter to create individual
grey matter binarized images, (3) transforming the
probabilistic atlas in standard MNI space into the individual’s MRI space, and (4) co-registering individual
PET onto the corresponding MRI. The grey matter
binarized image was then convolved with the atlas in
Analyze 11 to create an individualized object map.
Parametric images were then sampled for different
cortical and subcortical regions.
Statistical parametric mapping (SPM) analysis
SPM interrogation to localize mean differences
between patients and controls for [11 C](R)PK11195
BPND and rCMRGlc in AD and PDD was
performed using SPM8 (Wellcome Department
of Imaging Neuroscience, UCL, London, UK;
http:www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm). The between-group
comparison was performed at a voxel level with a
statistical threshold for significance set at p < 0.01
and an extent threshold of 50 voxels, as previously
described [20]. All clusters with a corrected p < 0.05
were considered to be significant.
Statistical analysis
As hippocampal neurons project to the entorhinal cortex, which in turn projects to the whole of
cortex, we anticipate that neuronal degeneration by
microglial activation follows the cortical connection
from hippocampus. Thus, to evaluate the relationship
between hippocampal volume and neuroinflammation in AD and PDD subjects, pixel-by-pixel
correlation between microglial activation, rCMRGlc
and hippocampal volumes was evaluated using SPM
where pixel-wise BPND of [11 C](R)PK11195 PET
and rCMRGlc were the dependent variable and the
hippocampal volume scores or hippocampal rCMRGlc were the covariate of interest.
Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS
22 in Windows 7 (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA).
Continuous variables were expressed as mean ± SD.
Normality was assessed using the KolmogorovSmirnov test. One-way ANOVA was used to compare
the three groups followed by Bonferroni post hoc

correction. The statistical interrogations of the ROI
data for glial activation and glucose metabolism
between AD and PDD versus controls was done with
two-tailed t-test in SPSS22 with a significance of
p < 0.05. We evaluated the major cortical regions like
frontal lobe, temporal lobe, parietal lobe and occipital lobe. As medial temporal lobe and hippocampus
are specifically involved in memory and neuroinflammation, we did a detailed analysis of medial
temporal lobe and hippocampus. As anterior and posterior cingulate are implicated in amyloid deposition
and reduction in glucose metabolism respectively, we
subsequently analyzed anterior cingulate, posterior
cingulate, thalamus and striatum. Categorical variables were compared by χ2 test.
We have evaluated hippocampal volumetric
measurements against [11 C](R)PK11195BPND and
rCMRGlc in hippocampus, medial temporal lobe,
and whole cortex and Spearman’s correlation was
employed by virtue of the limited sample size, and
a p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.
Correlations between Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, [11 C](R)PK11195 BPND ,
rCMRGlc, and hippocampal volume were analyzed
with Spearman’s correlation and a p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

showing no significant differences between AD
(MMSE = 19 ± 5.3) and PDD (MMSE = 21.3 ± 2.8)

assessment revealed global deficits in short and long

with AD subjects showing significantly worse scores
in short and long term memory compared to the PDD
group (Table 1).

Voxel-level correlation between
[11 C](R)PK11195 BPND , rCMRGlc,
and hippocampal volume using SPM
To evaluate the relationship between hippocampal volume, microglial activation, and glucose
metabolism, SPM pixel-by-pixel analysis was used
in AD and PDD. In AD subjects, the biggest clusters of correlation between microglial activation and
hippocampal volume involved the temporal, frontal,
parietal, and occipital cortex, as well as hippocampus
and parahippocampus; in PDD the clusters included
amygdala and parahippocampus, as well as frontal,
temporal, and occipital cortex. Figure 1A and B show
significant clusters of microglial activation using
multiple regression analysis of [11 C](R)PK11195
BPND against hippocampal volume in AD (A) and

PDD (B) at a cluster threshold of p < 0.00005 with
extent threshold of 200 voxels, where microglial activation was inversely correlated with hippocampal
volume in AD and PDD subjects. Details of the cortical regions with [11 C](R)PK11195 BPND inversely
associated with hippocampal volume in AD and PDD
are shown in Table 2. Supplementary Figure 1 shows
the clusters of significant [11 C](R)PK11195 uptake
in AD and PDD subjects compared to controls.
Figure 1C and D shows significant clusters
of increased [11 C](R)PK11195 BPND against hippocampal rCMRGlc in AD and PDD using multiple
regression at a cluster threshold of p < 0.000005 for
AD and p < 0.00005 for PDD with extent threshold
of 200 voxels. In this case, an inverse correlation is observed between hippocampal glucose
metabolism and cortical glial activation in AD and
PDD subjects. Details of the cortical regions with
hippocampal rCMRGlc inversely associated with
[11 C](R)PK11195 BPND in AD and PDD are shown
in Table 3. The clusters of significant correlation
mainly involve frontal, temporal, and parietal cortex
in AD subjects and frontal, temporal, and occipital
cortex in PDD subjects.
Figure 1E and F shows the significant clusters of
reduced rCMRGlc against hippocampal volume in
AD (C) and PDD (D), with regression analysis at a
cluster threshold of p < 0.000005 with extent threshold of 200 voxels. In this case, a direct correlation
is observed between glucose metabolism and hippocampal volume in AD and PDD subjects. Details
of the cortical regions with rCMRGlc inversely associated with hippocampal volume in AD and PDD are
shown in Table 4, with significant clusters involving the temporal and occipital cortex in AD and the
thalamus and temporal cortex in PDD.
Hippocampal volume, [11 C](R)PK11195BPND ,
and rCMRGlc in AD and PDD
The mean hippocampal total volume (left +
right) was 8465.7 ± 639.2 mm3 in control subjects, 6205.9 ± 1425.9 mm3 in AD and 7568.7 ±
1095.4 mm3 in PDD, indicating that hippocampal
volume was significantly reduced in AD compared
to controls (p = 0.001), while it was not significantly
different in PDD subjects compared to controls
(p = 0.324) at pairwise comparisons.
Table 5 shows [11 C](R)PK11195BPND in AD
and PDD at ROI level compared to controls.
[11 C](R)PK11195 BPND was significantly increased
in all cortical ROIs in AD subjects compared to

controls. Similarly, PDD subjects showed increased
levels of microglial activation compared to controls
in all cortical ROIs.
The regional cortical rCMRGlc in all groups is
given in Table 5. PDD subjects showed significant
reduction in glucose metabolism compared with the
control subjects across all the regions; AD subjects
showed reduced rCMRGlc compared to controls in all
brain regions with the exception of anterior cingulate.
ROI correlation between [11 C](R)PK11195
BPND , rCMRGlc, and hippocampal volume
We have evaluated the correlation between hippocampal volume and levels of microglial activation
and glucose metabolism in hippocampus in AD and
PDD patients. Bias corrected and accelerated bootstrap 95% CIs are reported in square brackets. A
significant inverse correlations between hippocampal
volume and hippocampal glial activation was found,
rho = –0.647 [–0.181, –0.893] (p = 0.005), as also
reported in Fig. 3. When AD and PDD were analyzed
separately, no significant correlations were found
between hippocampal volume and [11 C](R)PK11195
BPND in hippocampus, medial temporal lobe, and the
whole cortex at ROI levels. Hippocampal volume did
not show significant correlations with rCMRGlc in
hippocampus and medial temporal lobe in AD and
PDD.
Correlation between Cognition,
[11 C](R)PK11195 BPND , rCMRGlc,
and hippocampal volume
In the present study we found significant correlations between MMSE and [11 C](R)PK11195 BPND
in our predefined ROIs in the whole study population.
In particular, MMSE was negatively correlated with
[11 C](R)PK11195 BPND in hippocampus, rho =
–0.483 [–0.700, –0.086] (p = 0.029), in the medial
temporal lobe, rho = –0.585 [–0.801, –0.241]
(p = 0.002) and in the whole cortex, rho = –0.632
[–0.836, –0.311] (p = 0.001).
Additionally, we have evaluated the relationship
between cognitive function and hippocampal volume,
finding a significant positive correlation between
MMSE and hippocampal volume in the whole study
group, rho = 0.505 [0.118, 0.786] (p < 0.01). MMSE
also correlated with rCMRGlc in hippocampus,
rho = 0.713 [0.457, 0.873] (p < 0.0001) and in the
medial temporal lobe, rho = 0.678 [0.425, 0.834]
(p < 0.0001).

pocampus, measured using [11 C](R)PK11195PET,
were inversely correlated with hippocampal volume
and hippocampal glucose uptake in AD and PDD
subjects. This study provides further credence to the
hypothesis that microglial activation detected with
[11 C](R)PK11195 PET is correlated with markers
of neuronal damage as reduction in hippocampal
volume and glucose metabolism. This finding further supports the role of neuroinflammation and
microglial activation in neurodegenerative diseases
[5, 7, 20–22]. The spatial agreement between local
and distant microglial activation in the cortical projections and atrophy in hippocampus lends credence
to the theory that chronically activated microglial
cells might be one of the effectors of neurodegenerative processes; thus, influencing neuroinflammation
can have potential therapeutic implications in these
diseases. In this study we have found increased
levels of [11 C](R)PK11195 BPND across almost

all predefined brain regions in AD and PDD subjects compared to controls, consistent with previous
reports.
Growing evidence indicates that neuroinflammation contributes significantly to the pathological
process in chronic neurodegenerative diseases, and
this could act independently and along with the
other pathological substrates in neurodegenerative
diseases. In AD, microglial cells are activated by
amyloid deposition, generating a proinflammatory
response leading to neuronal death. The damaged
neurons and neurofibrillary tangles can in turn activate microglia, inducing a vicious cycle of neuronal
damage and reactive gliosis [23]. In PD, findings
from neuropathological studies have shown that
microglial cells are associated with ␣-synucleinpositive Lewy neurites [24], and that misfolded
␣-synuclein released from neurons can directly activate microglial cells. In PDD, according to Braak and
colleagues, the spread of Lewy body pathology starts
from dorsal motor nucleus of vagus and olfactory
nucleus, then reaches substantia nigra, basal forebrain, and ultimately the sensory association areas
and premotor areas of the neocortex. Thus, it could
be implied that neuroinflammation triggered by Lewy
body pathology follows the same temporal-spatial
progression, which in turn could lead to neuronal
damage both in anterograde and retrograde fashion.

Moreover, it has been demonstrated that microglial
activation may lead to synaptic dysfunction and loss
of dopaminergic axonal projections, with retrograde
neurodegeneration [25, 26]. In this study we have
shown that microglial activation locally and in the
cortical projections from hippocampus, could cause
neuronal damage and hippocampal atrophy, which is
novel, and has never been demonstrated before.
It should also be mentioned that microglial cells
in brain express different phenotypes, depending on
the type of proinflammatory stimuli received, either
via paracrine or autocrine manner [27]. The cytokine
stimulation is essential for microglial polarization
into the classically activated M1, or the M2 phenotype, which is activated by the alternate pathway
[28]. In AD, it has also been demonstrated that dysfunctional microglial response could contribute to A␤
accumulation [29]. As AD pathology worsens, there
is a switch from M2 to M1 phenotype consistent with
the idea that microglia become less responsive to M2
induction signals as they age [30–32]. In our study,
we cannot discern whether glial activation detected
by [11 C](R)PK11195 PET might be mainly due to
either of the two phenotypes. However, microglial
activation detected by [11 C](R)PK11195 PET is associated with hippocampal volume loss and correlated
with MMSE, suggesting the putative effect of the
microglial cells as described before.

G.D. Femminella et al. / Hippocampal Volume and Neuroinﬂammation

It is known that other factors can affect neuroinflammation, such as the activity of the central
adrenergic system. As an example, multiple lines
of evidence indicate that the adrenergic neurotransmitter norepinephrine also exerts anti-inflammatory
actions within the CNS. In transgenic AD mouse
models with locus coeruleus (the major source
of noradrenergic projections) degeneration, the
decrease of norepinephrine has shown to induce
the inflammatory reaction of microglial cells in AD
and to exacerbate neuroinflammation induced by the
deposition of amyloid [33–35].
In this study, we have also demonstrated that hippocampal volume in AD and PDD subjects is directly
correlated with reduction in glucose metabolism at
voxel level. This finding is in accordance with previous evidence which have shown that patients with
AD and PDD have extensive areas of cerebral atrophy and hypometabolism in comparison with control
subjects. Vander Borght et al. compared AD and PDD
subjects matched for dementia severity, finding similar metabolic reductions both globally and regionally;
however, PDD exhibited greater metabolic reduction in the occipital cortex but relatively preserved
metabolism in the medial temporal lobe compared
to AD. FDG-PET studies in AD have indicated that
glucose metabolic deficits start from the hippocampus and posterior cingulate cortex, and then involve
the temporo-parietal cortices [36]. In this study we
have been able to demonstrate a similar pattern of
hypometabolism and increase in microglial activation
on those regions.
Recent data have demonstrated that in PD patients
with mild cognitive impairment, hypometabolism
exceeds atrophy in the angular gyrus, occipital, orbital, and anterior frontal lobes [37]. In
PDD patients, the hypometabolic areas observed in
PD patients with mild cognitive impairment were
replaced by areas of atrophy, which were surrounded
by extensive zones of hypometabolism; areas where
atrophy extended more than hypometabolism were
found in the precentral and supplementary motor
areas in both patients with mild cognitive impairment
and with PDD, and in the hippocampus and temporal
lobe in patients with PDD.
These data are also in accordance with our findings.
First of all, while we found significant hippocampal atrophy in AD subjects, we were not able to
detect any significant differences in hippocampal volume between PDD and controls. Previous reports
evaluating hippocampal volume in PD and PDD
patients showed conflicting results. Some authors

have reported hippocampal atrophy even at early
stages of the disease, while others have not found
significant differences compared to age-matched controls [9–13]. Although mixed AD-PD pathology can
be present in our study population, our PDD patients
did not show significant hippocampal atrophy compared to age-matched controls. Our AD group also
showed occipital hypometabolism which more commonly is observed in PDD; however, this finding has
been observed in works from our studies and others
[38–40]. Unlike other studies, our measurement of
rCMRGlc was quantitative and absolute, as we used
the arterial input for the FDG-PET scans.
We evaluated the correlation between microglial
activation in the hippocampus, and cortical regions
where death of neuronal projections (direct and indirect) from the hippocampus could influence the level
of microglial activation due to the death of the neurons in the medial temporal lobe and neocortical
regions, as microglial activation and neuronal death
in the hippocampus could lead to microglial activation in the projected neurons. The hippocampal fibers
are connected directly to the entorhinal cortex, and
from there project on to perirhinal, parahippocampal cortices and widely to the cortex. This correlation
suggests that microglial activation could cause neuronal damage in the immediate vicinity as well as
at distant regions connected indirectly from the hippocampus. It is suggested that this could be due
to the loss of afferent and efferent fibers from the
hippocampal neurons, while cortical microglial activation independent of hippocampal denervation is
also a possibility. This phenomenon is also reported
in stroke [41].
Indeed, in our cohort hippocampal atrophy in AD
group seems to correlate well with neuroinflammation within the hippocampus and in regions of
direct or indirect cortical projections. It is known
that enthorinal cortex within the medial temporal lobe
is connected both via afferent and efferent neuronal
pathways to hippocampus. Moreover, the enthorinal
cortex is also connected to a variety of cortical and
subcortical regions: amygdala, olfactory bulb, cingulate cortex, temporal cortex, and the orbital cortex
(along with other frontal and parietal regions). Thus,
it is conceivable that neuroinflammation in the hippocampus could lead to neuronal dysfunction locally
and remotely in connected cortical areas, possibly
leading to neurodegeneration and atrophy (Fig. 2).
It could also be argued that microglial activation
in cortical areas of hippocampal projection might
lead to neuroinflammation and atrophy within the

G.D. Femminella et al. / Hippocampal Volume and Neuroinﬂammation

hippocampus. It is likely that both these processes
might happen in AD pathology, leading to a vicious
cycle of neurodegeneration. Interestingly, our data
set demonstrated that hippocampal volume correlated
significantly to the reduction in rCMRGlc and to the
increase in microglial activation in AD in wider (in
terms of voxel volume) brain regions compared to
PDD, suggesting that, for comparable cognitive status, the underlying microglial activation and reduction in rCMRGlc is spatially more widespread in AD
than PDD, and accordingly significant atrophy has set
in AD but not in PDD. Similarly, we have found that
the reduction in hippocampal glucose metabolism in
AD is associated with wider areas of increased glial
activation compared to PDD. This could suggest that
cognitive dysfunction in PDD is also contributed by
other factors like presence of ␣-synuclein.
The neuropsychometric assessment of the study
population indicated that the AD group achieved significantly lower scores than PDD in immediate and
delayed memory recall. This is partially in accordance with previous studies that have shown that,
for comparable MMSE levels, AD and PDD patients
perform differently on memory, attention and executive functions, even at early stages of the disease [42,
43]. This could be due to the different neuropathological substrate, which in AD affects primarily the
medial temporal cortex and the neocortical association areas, while in PD neurodegeneration starts
in the brain stem and subsequently spreads to the
cortical areas. In the present study we have also
found significant negative correlations between cognitive profile as measured by MMSE scores versus
[11 C](R)PK11195 BPND ; and a positive correlation
between MMSE score versus hippocampal volume,
and MMSE scores versus rCMRGlc, further suggesting the putative effect of microglial activation in late
stage of the disease [44, 45].
The findings of this study are limited by the small
number of subjects per group and by the crosssectional design, however, this proof of principle
study sheds more light into the role of neuroinflammation, and how this influences the neurodegenerative process. Also, the use of multiple comparisons
might increase the risk of false positive inferences
(type I error); we have reduced this error by applying
correction for multiple comparisons in our regression analysis. [11 C](R)PK11195 PET, though used
for many years as a selective marker of microglial
activation via binding to the upregulated TPSO
protein, shows in vivo binding 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than second-generation TPSO tracers like

1287

[11 C]PBR28. It has been shown that the rate of clearance of [11 C](R)-PK11195 is considerably faster than
many other widely used PET radioligands leading to
a very low ratio of specific to non-specific binding. It
is also suggested that the fraction of non-specifically
bound [11 C](R)-PK11195 in the grey matter is about
60%. However, reproducibility studies with [11 C](R)PK11195 have shown that the tracer binding in large
brain regions was acceptable for applied clinical studies [46]. Future studies with second generation TSPO
markers may be able to extend these results further in
other neurodegenerative diseases. However, secondgeneration tracers are influenced by the TSPO polymorphism. Moreover, although [11 C](R)PK11195 is
generally considered as a specific marker for activated microglial cells, several studies have suggested
that this tracer also binds to reactive astrocytes in
brain [47–49]. Another limitation of the present
study is that the observed correlations between hippocampal volume and [11 C](R)PK11195 BPND at the
ROI level, were not evident when the groups were
analyzed separately. Although we cannot exclude
that this is just simply attributable to differences
between groups, there was no significant difference
between microglial activation between these two
groups. However, we were only able to evaluate small
numbers of subjects, as enrolment of a larger number
of subjects was limited by the intensity of scanning
involved in this study. Previous reports from our
group have shown that a correlation exists between
MMSE scores and cortical microglial activation at a
voxel level using SPM analysis both in AD subjects
and PDD subjects separately [38].
In conclusion, we have shown that glial activation within the hippocampus, as assessed by
[11 C](R)PK11195PET, inversely correlates with hippocampal volume in neurodegenerative diseases with
dementia. These findings provide further evidence
for the central role of microglial activation in
neurodegenerative pathologies like AD and PDD,
and highlights microglial activation as a potential
therapeutic target in combating chronic neuroinflammation and resultant neurodegeneration.
