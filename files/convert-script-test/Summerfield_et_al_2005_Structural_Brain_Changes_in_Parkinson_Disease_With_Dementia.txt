Background: Parkinson disease with dementia (PDD)
results from neuropathological changes in cortical and
subcortical brain regions. Voxel-based morphometric
analysis of magnetic resonance images can contribute to
in vivo identification of the cerebral regions predominantly involved in PDD.
Objective: To identify structural cerebral regions most
closely related to the presence of PDD.
Design: Magnetic resonance images were obtained from
16 patients who had PDD, 13 patients with PD without
dementia, and 13 age-matched healthy control subjects.
Gray matter volumes were compared using optimized
voxel-based morphometric analyses.

Results: Compared with healthy controls, patients with
PDD showed gray matter volume decreases in several of the
following regions: bilateral putamen, accumbens nuclei, left
side of the thalamus, bilateral hippocampus, parahippocampal region, and anterior cingulate gyrus. Patients with PD
also showed gray matter reductions compared with healthy
controls in the right side of the hippocampus, left anterior
cingulate gyrus, and left superior temporal gyrus.
Conclusions: The hippocampus, thalamus, and anterior
cingulate are the regions most affected in PDD. Our results agree with recent neuropathological findings suggesting the involvement of the limbic and cortical areas in PD.

ARKINSON DISEASE (PD) IS
among the most frequent
chronic neurodegenerative
diseases. 1 The estimated
prevalence of PD with dementia (PDD) is approximately 30%2 and the risk
of dementia in patients with PD is almost 6
times higher than in the general elderly
population.3
The neuropathological basis responsible for the presence of PDD remains
controversial. Degeneration in the subcortical structures, notably the medial
part of the substantia nigra4; the basal
ganglia, amygdala, and thalamus 5 ;
nucleus basalis of Meynert6; and locus
coeruleus7 have variously been implicated in PDD. However, recent studies
also emphasize the importance of cortical changes. An association has been
observed between dementia and the
presence of cortical Lewy bodies.8,9 The
presence of Alzheimer-type neuropathology in PD is another likely contributor to
dementia.10,11
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) allows in vivo identification of global and
regional atrophy. Studies have shown PDD

to be associated with volumetric changes
in the substantia inominata,12 the hippocampus,13 and total cerebral volume.14
Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) allows the determination of brain density
and/or volume changes without a priori region of interest selection.15,16 This technique has been used in degenerative disorders such as Alzheimer disease, 17-20
dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB),21 and
mild cognitive impairment.22 In PD, it has
been used to determine the structures involved in the generation of parkinsonian
resting tremor.23
The aim of this study was to use VBM
to examine more closely the structural
brain changes responsible for PDD. We,
therefore, compared brain changes in patients with PDD, in patients with PD without dementia, and in healthy agematched control subjects.

having been in a previously published study.24 Three groups
of patients (16 patients with PDD, 13 patients with PD, and 13
controls) were recruited from the Parkinson Disease and Movement Disorders Unit, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain, during a 9-month period (Table 1). The study was approved by
the local ethics committee. Written informed consent was obtained from the patient or the patient’s caregiver.

DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA AND SELECTION
Idiopathic PD was diagnosed using the criteria of the Parkinson’s Disease Society Brain Bank, London, England.25 All
patients had a good or an excellent initial response to
levodopa treatment. Dementia was assessed using 3 standardized instruments: the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition (DSM-IV),26 the Clinical Dementia Rating scale,27 and the Mini-Mental State Examination.28
Subjects needed a Clinical Dementia Rating scale score of 1, a
Mini-Mental State Examination score of less than 23, and both
DSM-IV items to fulfill dementia criteria. The Clinical Dementia Rating scale and DSM-IV were administered by a trained
clinician (J.M. or Francesc Valldeoriola, MD), and the MiniMental State Examination by an experienced neuropsychologist (C.S.). Where required for the Clinical Dementia Rating
scale, collateral information was drawn from the patient’s
spouse or caregiver. The control group was matched for sex
and age (SD, ±5 years) to the patient with PDD. Three
patients were excluded owing to MRI movement artifacts.
Patients were clinically assessed using the Unified Parkinson’s
Disease Rating Scale.29

MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING
Magnetic resonance imaging was obtained in all subjects using a 1.5-T scanner (GE Medical Systems Co, Milwaukee, Wis)
and the head coil. A strict imaging protocol was used, including a 3-dimensional inversion recovery preparation spoiled gradient recalled echo sequence of the entire brain in the axial plane,
and the following parameters: repetition time, 17 milliseconds; echo time, 5 milliseconds; inversion time, 300 milliseconds; section thickness, 1.5 mm; field of view, 24⫻256 cm;
and number of excitations, 1.

VOXEL-BASED MORPHOMETRY
The MRIs were analyzed using SPM99 (WDCN, London or http:
//www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm).30 All the automated image processing was done by a single masked investigator (C.S.). One
subject with PD was excluded from VBM analysis because visual inspection of the MRI revealed marked hypointensities consistent with basal ganglia calcifications.
All MRI processing was carried out in accord with the optimized VBM protocol.16 Briefly, the processing steps outlined
by this protocol are (1) the creation of a customized anatomical
T1-weighted template and prior probability images separately for
each group, by normalizing the brain images to the default SPM
T1-weighted template, segmenting, averaging, and smoothing
the averaged brains in each group; (2) normalization of the structural brain images in each group using these customized templates, segmenting and cleaning the original T1-weighted images, normalizing the brain images to the customized templates,
segmentation and cleaning of normalized brain images, and modulation of gray matter images by the determinant of the Jacobian
matrix derived from the spatial normalization step. This procedure has been previously described in detail.16
Differences in gray matter were examined using analysis of
variance with post hoc comparisons (controls⬎patients with
PD; controls⬎patients with PDD; patients with PD⬎patients
with PDD). Statistical thresholds were corrected for the 3 post
hoc comparisons used here, using the SPM99 comparepopulations 1 scan per subject. Exclusive masking was used
to determine which voxel differences were specific to one disease process. Results were thresholded for the group being
studied at P⬍.001 (uncorrected for multiple comparisons).
Only those clusters exceeding a size of 10 voxels were
included in the analysis.
Owing to the characteristics of our acquisition protocol and
head size differences among subjects, the most superior and/or
inferior regions were absent in some subjects or not clearly visible after reorientation. Therefore, we restricted the volumetric analysis to a region of interest comprising the temporal lobes,
caudate, lentiform nuclei, cingulate gyrus, anterior cingulate,
thalami, insula, extranuclear region, amygdala, hippocampi, and
parahippocampus gyri. This was achieved by means of the Wake
Forest University–PickAtlas software31 (available at: http://www
.fmri.wfubmc.edu).

RESULTS

PATIENTS WITH PDD VS CONTROLS
When patients with PDD were compared with normal
age-matched controls, several cortical and subcortical areas
showed gray matter differences. Table 2 summarizes the
brain areas in which we observed voxels that differed
significantly between patients with PD and controls, the
size of the cluster of statistically significant voxels, the
Talairach coordinates of the peak voxel, and the z
scores. In the basal ganglia we observed bilateral gray
matter loss in the putamen, nucleus accumbens, and the
left side of the thalamus (Figure, center row). In the
limbic region, both sides of the hippocampus were
reduced in size (Figure, top row), as was the left parahippocampal region. In the cortical region the anterior
cingulate gyrus was also bilaterally decreased (Figure,
bottom row).
PATIENTS WITH PD VS CONTROLS
Patients with PD showed a gray matter reduction in the
following 3 regions compared with the controls: the right
side of the hippocampus, the left anterior cingulate, and
the left superior temporal gyri (Table 2).
PATIENTS WITH PDD VS

COMMENT

This study aimed to identify structural brain changes in
PDD using VBM. Our results showed that volumes of the
following several structures were reduced in patients with
PDD relative to age-matched controls: hippocampus, putamen, accumbens and thalamic nuclei, parahippocampal regions, and anterior cingulate gyrus.

Hippocampal atrophy has been consistently described
as a feature in dementia. In our study, VBM results showed
a bilateral hippocampal reduction in patients with PDD,
which was more pronounced in the right hemisphere. Previous studies have observed hippocampal degeneration in
PD.13,32 Hippocampal reductions may be due to both Lewy
body and Alzheimer-type changes.10,33,34
We also found a relationship between reduction of the
left side of the thalamus and dementia. The thalamus has
also recently been identified as a major target for neuropathological inclusions such as Lewy bodies in patients with PD,35 and an earlier study of neuropathology
and dementia in PD also identified volumetric loss in the
thalamus as a predictor of dementia.5 Because in our study,
the patients with PDD had greater motor impairment than
patients with PD, it is possible that tissue loss observed
in the thalamus and putamen may reflect motor as well
as cognitive impairment in PDD.
Analysis of cortical regions with VBM showed a marked
volume decrease in the anterior cingulate in patients with
PDD compared with controls. The anterior cingulate has
been shown to be particularly vulnerable to Lewy body
inclusions in PDD8,36 and DLB.36 Volumetric reduction
of the anterior cingulate may be involved in the attentional deficits described in PDD.37
We also found extensive volumetric reduction in the
parahippocampal gyrus. In DLB, cases with wellformed visual hallucinations exhibited high densities of
Lewy bodies in the amygdala and parahippocampus.38 Several subjects with dementia in our sample had a history
of visual hallucinations.
Patients with PD but without dementia also differed
from controls in the hippocampus and anterior cingulate, although reductions were less marked than for patients with PDD. Further, the comparison between patients with PDD and patients with PD revealed differences
in the right side of the hippocampus and the left superior temporal regions. Together these results suggest that
there may be a gradient of neuropathology affecting cingulate and medial temporal lobe structures in parkinsonism. Consistent with this idea, postmortem studies
have demonstrated that all patients with PD have some
degree of cortical Lewy body pathology.32
Our study has the limitations implicit to VBM procedures. One should be cautious when using automated image processing packages for investigations in degenerative diseases because the software was not specifically
designed to measure atrophy.39 We attempted to solve
this problem by creating a local template comprising both
patients with PDD, patients with PD, and controls. Also,
our sample was exclusive to patients from a clinical population and may not be representative of patients with PD
and patients with PDD in the wider community. We also
used criteria for enrollment in the PDD group that excluded patients with questionable or early-onset dementia and that focused on memory impairment rather than
visuospatial or attentional deficits. Our results may, thus,
pertain more to patients in the more-advanced stages of
dementia, and further studies with patients exhibiting a
spectrum of dementia severity may be required to establish whether MRI is a useful technique for differential diagnosis of PDD.

CONCLUSIONS

Voxel-based morphometric methods were used to examine structural brain changes in PDD; gray matter loss
at both cortical and subcortical sites was observed. Results revealed volumetric reductions in thalamic, hippocampal, and anterior cingulate regions, corroborating previous neuropathological findings in PDD.
