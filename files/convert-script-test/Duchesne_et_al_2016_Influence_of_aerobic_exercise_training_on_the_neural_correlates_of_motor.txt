Background: Aerobic exercise training (AET) has been shown to provide general health beneﬁts, and to improve
motor behaviours in particular, in individuals with Parkinson's disease (PD). However, the inﬂuence of AET on
their motor learning capacities, as well as the change in neural substrates mediating this effect remains to be explored.
Objective: In the current study, we employed functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) to assess the effect
of a 3-month AET program on the neural correlates of implicit motor sequence learning (MSL).
Methods: 20 healthy controls (HC) and 19 early PD individuals participated in a supervised, high-intensity, stationary recumbent bike training program (3 times/week for 12 weeks). Exercise prescription started at 20 min
(+5 min/week up to 40 min) based on participant's maximal aerobic power. Before and after the AET program,
participants' brain was scanned while performing an implicit version of the serial reaction time task.
Results: Brain data revealed pre-post MSL-related increases in functional activity in the hippocampus, striatum
and cerebellum in PD patients, as well as in the striatum in HC individuals. Importantly, the functional brain
changes in PD individuals correlated with changes in aerobic ﬁtness: a positive relationship was found with increased activity in the hippocampus and striatum, while a negative relationship was observed with the cerebellar
activity.
Conclusion: Our results reveal, for the ﬁrst time, that exercise training produces functional changes in known
motor learning related brain structures that are consistent with improved behavioural performance observed
in PD patients. As such, AET can be a valuable non-pharmacological intervention to promote, not only physical
ﬁtness in early PD, but also better motor learning capacity useful in day-to-day activities through increased plasticity in motor related structures.

1. Introduction
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a progressive disorder of multifactorial
etiology characterized by motor symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia and gait difﬁculties. Motor deﬁcits in PD are due to an abnormal neuronal activity of the motor circuit in the basal ganglia,

predominantly involving the striatum and the putamen (Amano et al.,
2013). Such brain dysfunctions lead to motor functional difﬁculties, including impairments in learning new motor skills (Clark, 2014), hence
adding burden to day-to-day activities and leading sometimes to inactivity and exacerbation of disease manifestation (van Nimwegen et al.,
2011). As a result, both the known striatal pathology in PD and the
lack of physical activity imposed by the disease can jeopardize the patients' capacity to acquire new motor skilled behaviours throughout
the progression of the neurodegenerative process.
Apart from the treatments commonly used to managed PD symptoms (e.g., dopaminergic-derived drug treatments and DBS), alternative

treatments, such as physical activity, have recently been investigated in
PD. Such a new approach is based on an increasing number of studies in
animals and humans, which indicate that physical exercise may attenuate symptoms of the disease, and even exert a neuroprotective effect
(Hirsch and Farley, 2009). In rodents for example, mice model of PD
forced to exercise on a treadmill did not develop behavioural deﬁcits
and signiﬁcantly preserved nigrostriatal neuronal connections as well
as striatal dopamine levels compared to sedentary mice (Pothakos et
al., 2009; Yoon et al., 2007). Petzinger et al. (2007) have also found
that a similar exercise intervention improves efﬁciency of brain dopamine cells more in mice who exercised as compared to those that did
not. Altogether, these results suggest that exercise improves dopaminergic neurotransmission efﬁciency by modifying the areas of the
brain (e.g., the substantia nigra and basal ganglia) where dopamine signals originate (Petzinger et al., 2007). Given that movement is modulated through dopamine, ﬁndings in rodents suggest a possible interaction
between behaviour and neuronal cerebral viability in the striatum after
cardiovascular exercise (Petzinger et al., 2010).
In humans, studies in PD individuals have demonstrated signiﬁcant
improvement in gait and mobility following supervised physical exercise (Beall et al., 2013; Herman et al., 2007; Nadeau et al., 2014; Ridgel
et al., 2011, 2009; van Eijkeren et al., 2008). Among the many different
types of physical training programs (e.g., resistance training, ﬂexibility,
coordination, etc.), aerobic exercise training (AET) has been the most
studied so far, and the one that has shown the most unequivocal beneﬁts on health across the life span (Voss et al., 2011). Although the underlying mechanisms in PD still remain conjectural, it has been
hypothesized that exercise-dependent plasticity following AET acts on
the brain in a similar manner as the dopaminergic-derived treatments,
using the same pathways to produce symptomatic relief (Beall et al.,
2013). It is thus possible that exercise dependent change can have beneﬁcial effects on motor skill learning processes. More speciﬁcally, AET
may restore motor sequence learning (MSL), a capacity that is frequently impaired in PD (Clark, 2014), by improving brain functioning at the
level of the striatum or motor-related associated circuits.
Despite behavioural impairment observed when performing MSL
tasks, studies have demonstrated that similar motor-related brain regions seem to be recruited in individuals with PD (Carbon et al., 2010;
Schendan et al., 2013; Werheid et al., 2003) as in healthy aging controls
(Albouy et al., 2015; Doyon et al., 2003). Speciﬁcally, functional brain
imaging studies with healthy participants have shown that brain plasticity associated with MSL relies on recruitment of striatum and hippocampus, as well as the cerebellum, motor cortical regions, and
prefrontal and parietal cortex (Albouy et al., 2015; Doyon et al., 2009).
Studies with PD individuals yielded similar regions, but different patterns of interaction between them, in the cortico-striatal and mediotemporal lobe networks (Carbon et al., 2010; Schendan et al., 2013;
Werheid et al., 2003). Furthermore, these ﬁndings could be inﬂuenced
by the disease stage and the impact of dopaminergic medication (see
Ruitenberg et al., 2015 for a review). However, studies directly comparing the neuronal substrate involved in MSL in healthy and PD are few
and those directly comparing the effects of aerobic exercise on the
MSL neuronal substrate in healthy and PD are non-existent. In fact,
one study demonstrated that a single bout of high-intensity aerobic exercise facilitates motor sequence learning in healthy individuals (Mang
et al., 2014), but the neural correlates of these effects have never been
investigated at the whole brain level; and furthermore, they have
never been speciﬁc to the chronic effects of exercise.
Thus, to date, there is a lack of evidence regarding the effects of aerobic training exercise on the MSL functional neuronal substrate in both
healthy and PD. In response to this knowledge gap, the principal aim of
the present study was to investigate, with whole brain functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), the neural substrate mediating the effects of cardiorespiratory exercise on MSL in both PD and healthy
control (HC) individuals. We have already presented behavioural evidence that 3-month AET improved MSL capacity in both healthy and

PD individuals, as well as executive functions in PD (Duchesne et al.,
2015). In the current article, we present the neuroimaging data related
to MSL from the same study and we hypothesize that 1) AET will improve MSL capacity through augmented activity in the cortico-striatal
(CS) system in PD, and 2) MSL-related cerebral activity changes observed after AET will be linked to improvement in aerobic ﬁtness in
both PD and HC groups.

2. Methods
2.1. Participants
Forty-two participants (21 PD patients and 23 HC) were eligible for
participation after the completion of the ﬁrst evaluation. However, between the evaluation and prior to the onset of the exercise regimen,
two HC participants decided to withdraw from the project for personal
reasons. One PD participant and one HC were excluded after the beginning for health security. One PD patient was excluded from analysis because of extreme results on several outcomes, even if this person
respected all inclusion criteria. PD patients had to be classiﬁed as stage
1 or 2 according to Hoehn and Yahr's scale (Hoehn and Yahr, 1967)
based upon evaluation of a certiﬁed neurologist. Participants who
were under medication continued their treatment all throughout the
study (testing and training). A total of 39 participants (18 women)
aged between 40 and 80 years old participated in the present study;
19 were diagnosed with PD and 20 were healthy control (HC) subjects.
They were screened for appropriateness for testing in an MR environment (e.g., no metallic implants that could interfere with testing, no
claustrophobia etc.). Then, the Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) (Warburton et al., 2011) was used to verify the
participant's safety in participating in a physical program. To control
for pre-existing experience in tasks requiring highly coordinated ﬁnger
dexterities, PD and HC subjects had to have no previous training in
playing a musical instrument, nor any training as a professional typist.
Other exclusion criteria included the presence of other neurological disorders, comorbidities likely to affect gait, or any history of smoking or
heart diseases, and high baseline physical activity.
These two groups were well matched with respect to their sex distribution, age, number of years of education and ﬁtness level (as there
were no signiﬁcant differences on any of these variables prior to the
AET intervention program, see Table 1). Yet, and as expected, signiﬁcant
group differences were found on Beck's depression and anxiety scales,
with PD patients showing higher scores on both scales as compared
with HC participants.

2.2. Clinical assessment of health and cardiovascular ﬁtness

2.4. Behavioural statistical data analysis

First, PD subjects were recruited based on a neurological assessment
performed by an expert neurologist. Clinical assessments of the participants' health and physical activity level were then performed by a
geriatrist, neuropsychologist and physiologist using the following
tests: the United Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) (Goetz et
al., 2008), the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) or Mini Mental
State Evaluation (MMSE) (Nazem et al., 2009), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (Beck and Beamesderfer, 1974) and Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) (Osman et al., 1997), as well as the Jackson's Questionnaire
(Jackson et al., 1990).
Participants' cardiovascular ﬁtness level was evaluated using either a
submaximal aerobic test (11 HC, 5 PD) or a medically supervised maximal oxygen uptake test (9 HC, 14 PD). The protocol required a ﬁve minutes resting period before measuring heart rate, blood pressure, and
aerobic capacity. For the evaluated with a sub-maximal test (using a recumbent bike), the test started with a workload stage of 35 or 50 W (for
women and men, respectively), lasting one minute; the intensity increasing progressively by 15 W every minute until they reached 85%
of their predicted maximal heart rate (HRmax = 208 − 0.7 × age).
When the target heart rate was reached, participants were asked to
complete the current stage (if possible). The power level (in W) of the
last completed stage was used to extrapolate the maximal aerobic
power (MAP). Then, VO2max estimation was calculated with body
weight (kg) and MAP (W) measures, using the American College
Sport Medicine's formula: VO2 = (10,8 × W/weight) + 7; MAP estimation was used for exercise prescription. For the participants that were
evaluated with a graded cycling (one minute workload stage) maximal
test, the protocol started again at 35 W or 50 W (for women and men,
respectively), and the intensity progressively increased by 15 W every
minute until maximal efforts criteria were fulﬁlled (e.g., age predicted
maximal heart rate ± 10 bpm and VO₂ plateau), or until subjects
could not maintain the required workload anymore (fatigue). Aerobic
capacity (VO2max) was measured directly using a breath-by-breath
system. The last completed stage power (W) was recorded and
used for exercise prescription (American College of Sport Medicine,
2006). Importantly, PD individuals performed the stress test while
following their usual medication regimen, which did not change
during the study period. In addition, for each patient, the stress
tests were administered at the same time of day and did not change
pre-to-post AET.

The main independent variables included in our analyses were the
presence/absence of the disease (i.e., PD vs. HC groups, between group
variable) and the effect of aerobic training, expressed as the time of testing (pre- vs. post- intervention, within-group variable). Dependent variables included the following: physical ﬁtness (expressed as VO2max
estimate) and the subject's performance (learning score) on the MSL
task. We ﬁrst assessed the relationship between independent and dependent variables using a mixed repeated measures analysis of variance
(ANOVA), with group as between-subjects factor and time of testing as
within-subjects factor. In order to account for the effect of multiple comparisons, the statistical signiﬁcance was adjusted using the Bonferroni
method. The two psychological variables (depression and anxiety)
were used as covariates in all subsequent analyses involving behavioural data, to control for group differences at baseline on these variables. All
analyses were performed with SPSS 20 (IBM Inc., Armonk, NY).

2.3. Motor sequence learning task
Subjects' implicit MSL capacity was evaluated using a version of
the serial reaction time (SRT) task (Nissen and Bullemer, 1987), in
which participants were asked to press buttons on a keyboard in response to corresponding visual stimuli presented on a screen. Unbeknown to the participants, stimuli were presented in a random or in
a repeating sequential order, in blocks of 40 stimuli each. These
blocks were presented in triplets (sequence, random, sequence),
with a total of 12 triplets during the entire training session. For
the sequential blocks, two 8-item, second order conditional
sequences (2-4-3-1-4-2-1-3 and 3-1-2-4-1-3-4-2) were used and
counterbalanced between sessions (pre-, post-AET) and subjects,
in order to avoid repetition of the learned sequence for the same individual. For each trial, reaction time (i.e., the time between the onsets of the stimulus to the completion of the response. To assess
sequence learning, reaction times (RTs) and accuracy were compared between the sequence and random blocks, with faster RTs
and better accuracy for sequence as compared to the random blocks
reﬂecting greater motor sequence learning capacity. More information on motor task procedure can be found in previous paper
(Duchesne et al., 2015).

2.5. Experimental procedure
Participants were tested on two time points: pre and post training.
Each occasion was similar and included two different days of testing
that occurred at least 48 h apart. On day 1, participants were ﬁrst informed in details about the study protocol before signing a consent
form, which was approved by the “Regroupement Neuroimagerie Québec” Ethics Review Committee. Participants were then evaluated with
respect to their functional capacities and cardiorespiratory ﬁtness
level, as well as to their medical and psychological status. This was
followed by giving instructions to participants regarding the scanning
procedure and the motor sequence learning task while lying in a mock
scanner. During this familiarization session, participants had time to
practice a randomly assigned trial to correct the positioning of the ﬁngers on the response box. On Day 2, participants' brain was then
scanned while completing the motor sequence task while positioned
in the magnetic resonance imaging system available at the “Unité de
Neuroimagerie Fonctionnelle” from the “Université de Montréal”, the
latter session occurring before and after the AET program.
2.5.1. The exercise protocol procedure
The cardiorespiratory ﬁtness program involved three months of recumbent bike-training, three times a week, 1 h/session, which occurred
at the same time of day. The exercise intensity prescription was based
on the subject's maximal aerobic power output from the maximum volume of oxygen (VO₂peak) uptake conducted on pre-test day (American
College of Sport Medicine, 2006). Duration of the exercise program
started at 20 min and 60% of intensity per session, and was then increased by steps of 5 min and 5% of intensity every week until participants reached 40 min of training at 80% intensity. To reach a highintensity level, bike speed was maintained at 60 rpm. As such, to achieve
the desired bike resistance power and adjust intensity level (if needed),
the work intensity was based on power output (Watt), controlling for
subject's heart rate. In addition, rate of perceived exertion (Borg scale)
(Borg, 1982) was assessed on each training session. The target of 75%
or more in participation rate in the ﬁtness training program was
achieved. In addition, PD individuals did not change their medication
regimen for the entire duration of the study.
2.6. fMRI data acquisition and analysis
Functional MRI-series were acquired using a 3.0T TIM TRIO scanner
system (Siemens, Erlangen, Germany), equipped with a 12-channel
head coil. Multislice T2*-weighted fMRI images were obtained with a gradient echo-planar sequence using axial slice orientation in an ascending
order (TR = 2650 ms, TE = 30 ms, FA = 90°, 43 transverse slices,
3 mm slice thickness, 10% inter-slice gap, FoV = 220 × 220 mm2, matrix
size = 64 × 64 × 43, voxel size = 3.4 × 3.4 × 3 mm3). A structural T1-

562

C. Duchesne et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 12 (2016) 559–569

weigthed 3D MP-RAGE sequence (TR = 2300 ms, TE = 2.98 ms, TI =
900 ms, FA = 9°, 176 slices, FoV = 256 × 256 mm2, matrix size =
256 × 256 × 176, voxel size = 1 × 1 × 1 mm3) was also acquired in all
subjects. Head movements were minimized using cushions and instructions prior to scanning.
Functional volumes were pre-processed and analysed using SPM8
(http://www.ﬁl.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/software/spm8/; Wellcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK) implemented in MATLAB.
Functional scans of each session were realigned using rigid body transformations, iteratively optimized to minimize the residual sum of squares
between the ﬁrst and each subsequent image separately for each session,
hence creating a mean realigned image. The mean functional image was
then coregistered to the structural T1-image using a rigid body transformation optimized to maximize the normalized mutual information between the two images. Coregistration parameters were then applied to
the realigned BOLD time series. An average subject-based template was
created using DARTEL in SPM8, and registered to MNI space (Montreal
Neurological Institute, http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca). All functional and
anatomical images were then normalized using the resulting template. Finally, all functional images were spatially smoothed using an isotropic 8mm full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel.
The analysis of fMRI data, based on a summary statistics approach,
was conducted in 2 serial steps, accounting respectively for ﬁxed and
random effects. For each subject, changes in brain regional responses
were estimated through a model including responses to the sequence
and random conditions separately in each practice session (pre and
post). These four regressors consisted of boxcars convolved with the canonical hemodynamic response function. Instructions as well as movement parameters derived from realignment of the functional volumes
were also included as covariates of no interest. High-pass ﬁltering was
implemented in the design matrix using a cut-off period of 128 s to remove slow drifts from the time series. Serial correlations in fMRI signal
were estimated using an autoregressive (order 1) plus white noise
model and a restricted maximum likelihood (ReML) algorithm.
The contrast of interest explored the main motor sequence learning
effect (Sequence - Random) between sessions (POST - PRE). The
resulting contrast images of each subject were then further spatially
smoothed (Gaussian kernel 6 mm FWHM) and entered in a secondlevel analysis, accounting for inter-subject variance. In the second
level analyses, one sample t-tests were performed to explore main
motor sequence learning effect between-sessions within each group
(HC and PD) separately. Subsequently, two-sample t-tests were performed in order to compare this effect between groups (HC vs PD).
Furthermore, we performed an additional analysis in order to assess the
relationship between these changes in brain activation and aerobic ﬁtness
across sessions. Speciﬁcally, the main sequence learning effect between
sessions was regressed against changes in aerobic ﬁtness to ascertain
whether these effects were related to the AET. As before, one sample ttests were performed to explore the regression effects within each group
(HC and PD) separately, and two-sample t-tests were performed in order
to compare the regression effects between groups (HC vs PD).
The set of voxel activation values resulting from each analysis described
above (activation and regression analyses) were displayed in statistical
maps at a threshold of p b 0.005 (uncorrected for multiple comparisons).
However, all statistical inferences were performed at a threshold of
p b 0.05 after family-wise error (FWE) correction for multiple comparisons
over small spherical volumes (10 mm radius) located in a priori deﬁned
structures of interest reported in published work on motor learning.
3. Results
3.1. Behavioural results
3.1.1. Aerobic exercise training
The 3-months aerobic training regimen yielded a signiﬁcant improvement in aerobic ﬁtness as indicated by the estimated VO2max in

the two groups combined (F1,35 = 17.333, p b 0.001), as well as in
both HC (F1,35 = 15.188, p b 0.001) and PD (F1,35 = 9.984, p b 0.003)
groups separately (see Supplemental materials for more details). Also
the estimated power level increased signiﬁcantly following AET in the
two groups combined (F1,35 = 16.461, p b 0.001) as well as in the HC
(F1,35 = 14.930, p b 0.001) and PD (F1,35 = 10.500, p b 0.003) groups
separately. However, there was no signiﬁcant group × session interaction, nor any group differences for all of these ﬁtness measures. Altogether, these results indicate that the effect of exercise had similar
physiological beneﬁts in both groups of participants who signiﬁcantly
increased their individual level of aerobic ﬁtness (Duchesne et al.,
2015).

3.1.2. Motor sequence learning
The detailed results of the MSL task for the two conditions (sequence
and random) and groups (PD and HC), both pre and post training session are reported elsewhere (Duchesne et al., 2015) and here in Supplemental materials. Even though the interaction between groups and
conditions regardless of time of testing (i.e. pre- vs. post-AET) was not
signiﬁcant (F1,35 = 0,266, p = 0.6), across all participants, we observed
a signiﬁcant difference in reaction time between conditions (F1,35 =
17.712, p b 0.001), with performance during the sequence being faster
than during the random condition; an indicator of motor sequence
learning capacity. In addition, there was a marginally signiﬁcant interaction between condition and session (F1,35 = 3.650, p = 0.064) across
the two groups, hence demonstrating a trend that the participant's
motor sequence learning capacity tended to improve more than their
performance in the random condition following AET.
Within-group analyses revealed between-session improvement in
reaction time for both sequence (F1,35 = 12.525, p b 0.001) and random
conditions (F1,35 = 8.422, p b 0.006); whereas PD individuals showed
AET-related improvement in RT only for the sequential condition
(F1,35 = 5.173, p b 0.029). Most importantly, when assessing motor sequence learning capacity in each group, we identiﬁed a signiﬁcant sequence learning effect (i.e., sequential - random conditions) pre-AET
in HC (F1,35 = 4.059, p = 0.052), but not in PD (F1,35 = 1.427, p =
0.24). After AET, however, both groups showed signiﬁcant sequence
learning (F1,35 = 7.134, p b 0.011, for HC and F1,35 = 8.878, p b 0.005).

3.2. Brain imaging results
3.2.1. Functional brain changes related to motor learning capacity following
AET in PD
To investigate the effects of AET on the neural correlates speciﬁc to
motor sequence learning, we contrasted the main sequence learning effect [Sequence – Random] by session [POST – PRE] within PD group. The
results of this analysis revealed signiﬁcant training-related changes for
PD's individuals. Speciﬁcally, brain responses reﬂecting motor sequence
learning capacity increased signiﬁcantly post-AET in the temporal lobes,
left ventral striatum, left hippocampus, cerebellar lobules 8 and 9 bilaterally and right crus (Table 2, Fig. 1).
To test whether pre-post functional brain changes expressing motor
learning capacity were indeed related to improvement in aerobic ﬁtness, we conducted a regression analysis between changes in estimated
VO2max and changes in MSL brain responses ([Sequence –
Random] × session [POST – PRE]). In PD patients, increases in VO2max
(indicating improved aerobic ﬁtness as a result of training) correlated
positively and signiﬁcantly with increases activity in the hippocampus

563

bilaterally (Table 2. Fig. 2) and the left dorsal striatum. This indicated
that as the aerobic capacity improved in PD patients, the motor learning
speciﬁc activation also increased in these brain regions. In contrast, a
signiﬁcant negative correlation was observed in bilateral cerebellum
lobe 7, 8 and 9 (Table 2, Fig. 2).
While the regions corresponding to the main sequence learning effect and those resulting from the regression analysis were found in similar macro-structures (i.e. hippocampus, striatum), they did not
spatially overlap.

3.2.2. Functional brain changes related to motor learning capacity following
AET in HC
The main learning effect [Sequence – Random] by session [POST –
PRE] assessed within the HC group revealed no signiﬁcant change in activity between sessions. The regression analysis [Sequence –
Random] × session [POST – PRE] also revealed no signiﬁcant correlation
between AET-related changes in aerobic capacity and brain changes related to motor learning capacity for HC group alone.

3.2.3. Between group differences in functional brain activity related to motor learning capacity following AET
When comparing the two groups (PD vs. HC) on the main learning
effect [Sequence – Random] by session [POST – PRE], PD patients
showed signiﬁcantly higher levels of motor learning related activation

than HC, post-AET as compared to pre-AET, in the left cerebellum (lobules 8 and 9), right globus pallidus, and left ventral striatum (Table 3,
Fig. 3). The left hippocampus was marginally signiﬁcant (0.06) in this
contrast. However, no signiﬁcant differences were found in the opposite
direction (i.e., HC greater than PD) for the same contrast.

3.2.4. Functional brain changes following AET in PD and HC regressed
against changes in aerobic ﬁtness
Between-group differences in regression between VO2max changes
and MSL-related brain activity changes were observed in the right hippocampus (Table 3, Fig. 4) and in left cerebellum lobules 8, 9 and 7 (negative correlation). These between-group effects were both driven by the
ﬁndings in the PD group. Again, there was no spatial overlap between
the regions obtained from the regression analysis (Section 3.2.4) and
those obtained from the group contrast (Section 3.2.3), albeit they
were found in the same macro-structures (i.e. hippocampus, cerebellum lobule 8 and 9). Also, no signiﬁcant differences were found in the
opposite direction (i.e., HC greater than PD).
4. Discussion
We recently reported that 12 weeks of progressive intense AET resulted in signiﬁcant improvement in aerobic ﬁtness as well as motor
skill learning in both PD and HC groups (Duchesne et al., 2015). AET-related MSL improvements were global in HC individuals as they were observed in both conditions (sequence and random), but were speciﬁc to
the sequence condition in PD patients. In addition, PD patients improved their sequence-speciﬁc motor learning capacity after aerobic
training as indicated by the signiﬁcant difference between sequence
and random conditions after the training period only. Interestingly, in
the present study, the neuroimaging results corroborate those behavioural ﬁndings and suggest that AET-related changes in motor sequence
learning capacity (i.e., difference between sequence and random conditions) are mainly seen in PD individuals. Speciﬁcally, increases in MSLspeciﬁc brain activity due to training were found in the temporal lobe,

hippocampus, striatum and cerebellum in the PD group. Importantly,
there was also a positive relation between the patients' change in aerobic ﬁtness and MSL-related changes in the hippocampal and striatal activity, while we found a negative relation between the change in ﬁtness
level and activity in the cerebellum in PD patients. Most importantly,
the effects at the cerebral level are larger in the PD than in the HC group.
4.1.1.1. MSL exercise-dependent plasticity related to the striatum and hippocampus in PD individuals
The current study is the ﬁrst to examine the changes in neural substrate supporting MSL following aerobic exercise training in both
healthy controls and PD patients. Our ﬁndings thus extend the neuroimaging literature on implicit MSL in PD individuals and HC participants
(Gamble et al., 2014; Ruitenberg et al., 2015; Siegert et al., 2006), by speciﬁcally highlighting the positive effects of AET on the MSL-related activity in the striatum, cerebellum and; all structures that are typically
involved in motor learning (Albouy et al., 2013; Doyon et al., 2009,
2011). In fact, our hypothesis regarding changes in MSL speciﬁc to
striatal changes following AET was conﬁrmed in PD individuals. This
ﬁnding is consistent with previous studies, which have revealed AETdependent neuroplasticity in the central nervous system due to neurochemical changes in the striatum, the latter having been proposed as
one possible mechanism of action to explain the gains in performance
on motor tasks in PD (Petzinger et al., 2010, 2011, 2013, 2015). Indeed,

research in animal models of PD using dopaminergic neurotoxins has
shown that behavioural motor ameliorations following physical exercise are associated with increased efﬁciency in dopaminergic and glutamatergic neurotransmission (Fisher et al., 2013; Paillard et al., 2015;
Petzinger et al., 2013, 2010, 2015), which together are thought to reduce
the cortically-driven hyper-excitability observed in PD patients. These
authors have reported an increase in dopamine availability coupled
with a greater expression of dopamine D2 receptors, hence producing
a better dopaminergic signaling in the striatum overall. Furthermore,
physical exercise has been found to diminish the amount of synaptic
glutamate release, which is known to decrease the level of cortical excitability (Fisher et al., 2004). Although conjectural, it is thus probable that
the AET-speciﬁc changes in striatal activity observed in the current
study may reﬂect this type of neurochemical mechanism, which
would in turn explain the improvement in motor learning.
Interestingly, our results revealed that AET-related and MSL-speciﬁc
functional brain changes are not only observed in the striatum, but
within the hippocampus and cerebellum as well. These ﬁndings could
suggest that such brain structures are part of the functional network
compensating for the typical dysfunction within the cortico-striatal circuits seen in PD. In fact, the reported positive relationship between
changes in aerobic ﬁtness and AET-related MSL brain changes in the
same macro-structures (hippocampus and striatum) is consistent with
emerging data suggesting that links between the hippocampus and
the dopaminergic systems in PD are important in memory and learning

C. Duchesne et al. / NeuroImage: Clinical 12 (2016) 559–569

(Calabresi et al., 2013). In their review, Calabresi et al. (2013) suggested
that, while dopamine-dependent impairment (involving a complex molecular dysfunction at glutamatergic synapses) of hippocampal longterm potentiation (LTP) might contribute to cognitive impairments in
PD, such interactions could also be a potential source of symptoms reduction in PD patients. Clinical interventions such as AET, for example,
could potentially stimulate neurogenesis in the dysfunctional hippocampus of PD's individuals, as it has been shown in rodent's studies
(Voss, Vivar, Kramer, and van Praag, 2013). This type of interventions
could also be responsible for the associated involvement of neurotrophic factors, as a greater expression in brain-derived neurotrophic factor
(BDNF) and LTP mechanisms following exercise has also been proposed
as a putative mechanism responsible for the neuroprotective effects and
functional improvements in this clinical population (Audiffren, André,
and Albinet, 2011; Dishman et al., 2006; Fabel and Kempermann,
2008; Gomez-Pinilla, Zhuang, Feng, Ying, and Fan, 2011; Mustroph et
al., 2012; Voss, Vivar, Kramer, and van Praag, 2013). Based on evidence
that exercise-dependent brain changes within the hippocampus have
been associated with functional changes in memory (Erickson et al.,
2011; Szabo et al., 2011), we can thus conjecture that the improvement
observed during MSL in PD following AET could be explained by LTPlike processes, due to greater expression of BDNF in the hippocampus.
In light of these recent ﬁndings (Calabresi et al., 2013), it can be hypothesized that the beneﬁcial effect that AET has on MSL-related activity in both of these regions, may be based on the interaction or
functional connectivity between them. It is possible that plastic AETand MSL-related changes may ﬁrst occur within the hippocampus, and
then propagate in basal ganglia via interactions between the MTL and
dopaminergic system. This assumption is based on the fact that while
MSL-related changes were observed in both hippocampus and striatum
in PD individuals, only in the hippocampus we found regions in which
MSL-related changes in activity remained positively correlated with improvements in aerobic ﬁtness when PD and HC participants were compared. Yet further functional connectivity investigations are still
necessary to elucidate such AET-related brain reorganisation.

indicating a ‘restoration’ of functionality in the network typically seen
in MSL.
According to the motor sequence learning literature, both the cerebellum and striatum are known to be involved in the early MSL phase,
while only the striatum has been shown to maintain its activity in
later learning stages when the memory trace has been consolidated
(Doyon et al., 2009, 2011, 2002). Therefore, while modest improvements in aerobic capacity linked with increases in cerebellar activity
may reﬂect learning in the early stage tested here, the fact that large improvements in aerobic ﬁtness were associated with an enhanced hippocampal and striatal functioning may reﬂect a transition towards a more
durable stage of MSL. These MSL ﬁndings are thus in line with previous
structural and physiological investigations, which parallel the functional
changes that aerobic exercise can exert in general (e.g., (Hillman,
Erickson, and Kramer, 2008) for a review), and in PD, in particular
(Ahlskog, 2011; Alberts, Linder, Penko, Lowe and Phillips, 2011;
Goodwin, Richards, Taylor, Taylor, and Campbell, 2008; Hirsch and
Farley, 2009; Speelman et al., 2011) for reviews).
4.1.1.3. MSL and exercise in HC individuals
Compared to PD individuals, AET did not have a statistically signiﬁcant effect on changes in the neural correlates of MSL in the HC group.
Such divergence between the HC and PD groups could be explained
by a potential ceiling effect observed at baseline for the HC group in
regards to their MSL capacity at both the behavioural and cerebral
level. Given that HC individuals already showed a good MSL capacity
prior to AET, they obviously had less room for sequence-speciﬁc behavioural improvement compared to PD patients. This is supported by the
fact that analysis of the behavioural results revealed that, while HC individuals improved their motor performance in both random and sequence condition after AET, they also maintained a similar magnitude
in RT difference between these two conditions (Duchesne et al., 2015).
This pattern of results can be interpreted as HC individuals having a
more efﬁcient medial temporal lobe, CS, CC functioning networks
prior to AET, as compared to PD patients, which leaves also less room
for improvements to be seen in functional activity in these brain areas.

4.1.1.2. MSL exercise-dependent plasticity related to the cerebellum in PD
individuals

5. Limitations and conclusions

In the current study, we found that AET-related and MSL speciﬁc
changes in the cerebellum correlated negatively with changes in aerobic
capacity. Although apparently contradictory, this result can be
interpreted in light of several lines of evidence from previous studies:
First, changes in the cerebellum have been interpreted as a compensatory functional system in animal models of PD model following exercise
(Holschneider, Yang, Guo, and Maarek, 2007; Wang, Guo, Myers,
Heintz and Holschneider, 2015a; Wang, Guo, Myers, Heintz, Peng,
Maarek and Holschneider, 2015b), and a similar assumption has been
proposed following striatal dysfunction in PD (Doyon, 2008). Second,
human studies have indicated that both the cortico-striatal (CS) and
cortico-cerebellar (CC) systems play distinctive roles in MSL (Doyon,
2008; Doyon and Benali, 2005; Doyon et al., 2003; Leggio and
Molinari, 2015), despite the fact that cerebellum and basal ganglia are
known to be interconnected (Bostan and Strick, 2010; Hoshi,
Tremblay, Feger, Carras, and Strick, 2005). Given the interaction between the CC and CS systems during MSL (Doyon, 2008; Doyon et al.,
2009; Doyon and Benali, 2005) and the fact that previous functional imaging data revealed that cerebellar hemispheres are hyperactivated,
while the striatum is hypoactivated in PD patients as compared to
healthy controls (Yu, Sternad, Corcos, and Vaillancourt, 2007), it is
thus possible that the cerebellum is capable of compensating for the deﬁcient basal ganglia activity observed in PD. Hence, in the current study,
the PD participants who improved less their aerobic capacity used predominantly the cerebellum during MSL, whereas those who had higher
changes in aerobic ﬁtness used more the hippocampus and striatum,

One of the limitations in our study was the heterogeneity of the patient population. Similar to many other studies with PD patients, disease
characteristics were diverse (e.g., motor, cognitive, neuropsychiatric,
etc.). In fact, it was often a challenge to control for all symptoms and obtain a homogeneous sample. However, we used several strategies to address this limitation. First, we matched the PD group with the HC group
with respect to sex distribution, age, years of education, cognitive and
ﬁtness level. In addition, given that the two groups differed in their depression and anxiety symptoms, we accounted for these variables in our
statistical analyses by considering them as covariates in the analyses of
the behavioural data. Another limitation of our study was the lack of a
PD control group for the type of exercise. Despite this constraint, however, it is worth noting the fact that we conducted a regression analysis
highlighting that there were functional brain changes that were related
to changes in aerobic ﬁtness level, which indicate that there were brain
changes speciﬁc to the AET program in PD patients.
To conclude, this study is the ﬁrst to assess the neural correlates of
MSL following AET in PD. Functional reorganisation of brain activity in
early PD following aerobic training was observed within the hippocampus, the striatum and the cerebellum, resulting in improvement of their
learning capacity. Most importantly, in the same brain structures, albeit
in different sub-regions, we have also showed that MSL speciﬁc brain
plasticity correlated with changes in aerobic ﬁtness, showing a positive
relationship within the hippocampus and the striatum and a negative
relationship within the cerebellum. Altogether our study makes two important contributions to the ﬁeld. First, we show that a 12-week

568

progressive aerobic training regimen has beneﬁcial effects on motor
skill learning in sedentary PD and healthy individuals. Second, we highlight the neurophysiological changes underlying exercise-dependent
plasticity in PD, with particular emphasis on the neuronal substrate of
MSL. Our results thus pave the way for other studies to further explore
the structural and functional organization within brain regions and how
exercise-dependent plasticity manifests itself within the medial temporal lobe, CS and CC systems following chronic or acute bouts of aerobic
activities in PD. As a result, these ﬁndings have important clinical implications for the rehabilitation of PD individuals, as the design and the use
of non-pharmacological interventions based on physical exercise can be
implemented to improve motor learning capacity and restore motor
functions in patients afﬂicted with this debilitating disease.
