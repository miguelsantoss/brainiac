ABSTRACT
The volume of the temporal lobe, superior temporal gyrus, amygdala, and hippocampus
was quantified from magnetic images of the brains of 99 healthy children and adolescents aged
4-18 years. Variability in volume was high for all structures examined. When adjusted for a 9%
larger total cerebral volume in males, there were no significant volume differences between
sexes. However, sex-specific maturational changes were noted in the volumes of medial
temporal structures, with the left amygdala increasing significantly only in males and with the
right hippocampus increasing significantly only in females. Right-greater-than-left laterality
effects were found for temporal lobe, superior temporal gyrus, amygdala, and hippocampal
volumes. These results are consistent with previous preclinical and human studies that have
indicated hormonal responsivity of these structures and extend quantitative morphologic
findings from the adult literature. In addition to highlighting the need for large samples and
sex-matched controls in pediatric neuroimaging studies, the information from this understudied age group may be of use in evaluating developmental hypotheses of neuropsychiatric
disorders.

The temporal lobes and related medial structures, such
as the amygdala and the hippocampus, subserve functions
of language, memory, and emotion (Nolte, 1993). Human
capacity for these functions changes markedly from ages 4
to 18 years (Jerslid, 1963; Wechsler, 1974; Diener et al.,
1985);however, because of the paucity of postmortem data
or well controlled imaging studies of healthy children
(Giedd et al., 19961, little is known about morphometric
changes in these structures that parallel cognitive and
behavioral development.
Electroencephalographicstudies of adolescents and young
adults indicate ongoing maturation of the temporal lobes
during the second decade of life (Buchsbaum et al., 1992).
To our knowledge, however, no in vivo quantitative morphologic studies of these structures have been carried out for
children and adolescents. I n one of the few postmortem
studies of temporal lobe or related structures that included
subjects from the child and adolescent age range, it was
noted that myelination in a key relay zone of the hippocampal formation continues throughout adolescence (Benes
et al., 1994).

With the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI),
studies of normal aging in adults have indicated maturational changes for the temporal lobe and for medial temporal structures, which, in part, are sex specific. For instance,
a recent study comparing brain morphology of 36 subjects
aged 20-35 years to that of 33 subjects aged 60-85 years
found age-related decreases in the amygdala for males and
females but found a decrease in the hippocampus for
females only (Murphy et al., 1996). A study comparing
temporal lobe measures of 96 subjects aged 18-40 years to
those of 34 subjects aged 41-80 years found an 8%.decrease
in temporal lobe volume for males (Cowell et al., 1994).
However, these results may reflect processes at the extreme
end of the aging process. A recent study that included 87
healthy adults aged 18-55 years reported larger superior
temporal gyrus volumes in males but found no significant
age effects (Flaum et a]., 1996).

Based on these reports and on animal and human studies
that have indicated the responsivity of these structures to
hormones (Morse et al., 1986; Gould et al., 1990; Murphy
et al., 1993), we anticipated sex-specific maturational
changes in the temporal lobe and in related medial structures for our child and adolescent sample, possibly with
exaggerated effects concurrent with the hormonal changes
of adrenarche or puberty.
Volumetric measures of the temporal lobe, superior
temporal gyrus, amygdala, and hippocampus were acquired
in 99 healthy children and adolescents aged 4-18 years.
This study is part of an ongoing project at the Child
Psychiatry Branch of the National Institute of Mental
Health to examine the relationship between brain form and
function in healthy and neuropsychiatrically impaired children and adolescents. Quantitative morphometry of the
:erebrum, cerebellum, and basal ganglia for most of the
subjects from this data set have been reported elsewhere
:Giedd et al., 1996).

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects
Healthy male ( n = 53) and female ( n = 46) subjects
mean age 11.8years, S.D. 3.4 years, range 4.7-17.8 years)
vvere recruited from the community over the last 5 years.

Veurological Examination for Subtle Signs (PANESS) intentory (Denckla, 1985) and clinical psychiatric interviews

Achenbach and Edelbrock, 1983), Conners' 48-item Par:nt and 39-item Teacher Questionnaires (Conners, 1973;
2oyette et al., 1978), Vocabulary, Block Design, and Digit
Span subtests of the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Chilken-Revised
(WISC-R; Wechsler, 1974) for subjects unler 16 years of age or the Wechsler Adult Intelligent
kale-Revised for subjects 16 or older (Wechsler, 1981),

consisting of Letter-Word Identification, Word Attack, and
?assage Comprehension subtests; Woodcock and Johnson,
1977). Individuals with physical, neurological, or lifetime
iistories of psychiatric abnormalities were excluded. Subects with first-degree relatives or with more than 20% of
second-degree relatives with major psychiatric disorders
vere also excluded. Approximately five candidates were
screened for every one accepted (Giedd et al., 1996). To
mhance the independence of sample subjects, only one
:hild per family was included in the data set. Male subjects
vere taller than the female subjects (t = 2.37; P = 0.02) and
;cored higher on the Vocabulary subtest of the WISC-R (t =
1.99;P = 0.05). There were no significant group differences

subjects in the youngest age quartile. The protocol was
approved by the Institutional Review Board of the National
Institute of Mental Health. Written consent from the
parents and assent from the child were obtained.

MRI acquisition
All subjects were scanned on the same GE 1.5 Tesla Signa
Advance scanner (GE Signa version 5.4). Three-dimensional volumetric acquisition using spoiled-gradient recalled echo in the steady state yielded images with slice
thicknesses of 1.5 mm in the axial and sagittal planes and
2.0 mm in the coronal plane. Images were acquired from
coronal, axial, and sagittal orientations to avoid possible
multiplanar reformatting errors related to nonanisotropic
voxels. Time to echo was 5 msec, time to repeat was 24
msec, flip angle was 4", acquisition matrix was 192 X 256,
number of excitations was 1, and field of view was 24 cm.
Head positioning during the scan was standardized by
assuring that three vitamin E capsules, one placed in the
meatus of each ear and one taped to the left lateral inferior
orbital ridge, were all visible on a single axial slice. If no
slice clearly contained all three capsules, then the patient
was realigned until this criterion was met. Head positioning
in the remaining plane was standardized by positioning the
subject's nose a t the 12:OO position. The subjects were
scanned in the evening to promote their falling asleep in the
scanner. Younger children were allowed to bring blankets
or stuffed animals into the scanner and to have their
parents read to them. Three children aged 5, 7, and 11 who
had been accepted for the study were unable to complete
the scan due to claustrophobia or excessive anxiety. No
sedation was used.

Image analysis
Clinical interpretation. All scans were evaluated by a
clinical neuroradiologist. One subject was found to have
increased T2 signal intensity in the area of the left semiovale. Another subject was noted to have increased T2 signal
intensity in the right parietal lobe. Neither hyperintensity
was deemed clinically significant, and, on clinical follow up,
both subjects were asymptomatic. They were retained in
the data set. No other gross abnormalities were reported.
Total cerebral volume quantification. A technique that
utilizes an active surface template of the brain to incorporate prior knowledge of brain anatomy to supplement MRI
signal intensity characteristics was used to quantify the left
and right cerebral hemispheres. This method models the
brain surface as an elastically deformable structure while
using successive iterations of an energyminimization function to enforce constraints on curvature and topology. After
this procedure, the brains were examined and edited slice
by slice in the axial plane by experienced raters to remove

slices on which brain matter is visible. Further details are
provided elsewhere (Snell et al., 1995).
Temporal lobelsuperior temporal gyrus quantification.
The imaging data were imported into an image analysis
program developed at the NIH (Rasband, 1993). Measures
of the temporal lobe, superior temporal gyrus, amygdala,
and hippocampal formation were all done by manual tracing in the coronal plane by a single experienced rater
(A.C.V.) who was blind to any subject characteristics. The
temporal lobe is discerned from the frontal and parietal
lobes by the Sylvian fissure. The temporal stem was divided
by a line connecting the most inferior point of the insular
cisterns to the most lateral point of the hippocampal or
amygdaloid fissure (Fig. 1). The posterior extent of the
temporal lobes was defined by the coronal slice containing
the posteriormost aspect of the corpus callosum (inclusive;
Bilder et al., 1994). The superior temporal gyrus was
identified by the gyral boundary in each of the coronal
sections of the temporal lobes and extended posteriorly to
the most posterior slice in which fibers of the fornix were
visible (Shenton et al., 1992). The number of coronal slices
to quantify the temporal lobes ranged from 30 to 40, with a
mean of 34.6.
Amygdala/ hippocampal formation quantification. Our
designation of the hippocampal formation included the
cornu ammonis, dentate gyrus, and subiculum. Each of
these components has different histological characteristics
and has topographically well ordered afferents and efferents
(Nolte, 1993). However, precise delineation of boundaries,
such as that between amygdala and hippocampus, can be
difficult even at a histological level (Bergin et al., 1994). The
coronal slice containing the most anterior portions of the
mammillary bodies was used as a boundary to separate the
amygdala from the hippocampus (Shenton et al., 1992;
Bogerts et al., 1993). The posterior boundary of the hippocampal formation was the most posterior slice in which
fibers of the fornix were visible (Cook et al., 1992; Shenton
et al., 1992). The number of coronal slices used to quantify
the amygdala averaged 6.1, and the number to quantify the
hippocampus averaged 15.9.
Reliabilities for each of the structures were established
by having two raters (A.C.V. and J.N.G.) initially measure
ten subjects twice to determine intrarater and interraterintraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and then by blindly
introducing previously measured scans throughout the
analysis to account for possible “drifts” in rater assessment. Interrater ICCs for the structures measured were as
follows: temporal lobe, 0.98; superior temporal gyrus, 0.92;
amygdala, 0.86; hippocampus, 0.87. Outlines of these structures are presented in Figure 1. Total image processing
time for each subject was approximately 3 hours.

Statistical analysis
The SAS General Linear Model procedure was used to
examine the total group and sex-specific effects of age on
brain structure volumes (SAS Institute, 1990). Because
total brain volume differed significantly between males and
females (9% larger in males), sex differences were analyzed
by using repeated-measures ANOVA and ANCOVA to
adjust for total cerebral volume.
In addition, linearity and constant variance assumptions
were relaxed by using a local regression procedure that
retained the subtle nonlinearities in the data (Hastie and
Tibshirani, 1990) to yield smooth, curvilinear, and sexspecific adaptive fits to the scatterplots of structure vol-

umes by age. Males and females were analyzed separately,
because single, classical, statistical models make linear and
equal variance assumptions that are not always supported
by our data. However, we have included results from the
combined analyses (see Table 3) to allow comparison to
previous reports.

RESULTS
The variability of size was high for all structures examined in this well screened group of healthy children (see Fig.
2). Despite this, sex, maturational, and laterality effects
were seen.

Sex
Cerebral volumes, as reported previously (Giedd et al.,
1996),were approximately 9% larger for males ( t = 5.6; P <
0.0001), even after adjustment for height and weight ( F =
27.5; P < 0.001). Similarly, for all temporal lobe structures
measured, male volumes were approximately 10% larger.
When they were adjusted for total cerebral volume
(ANCOVA), the temporal lobe measures did not show
sexual dimorphism. Table 2 shows sex and side (left or
right) ANOVAs and ANCOVAs corrected for total cerebral
volume. No interactions between sex and side were found.

Maturational change
Similar to the previously reported total cerebral volumes
(Giedd et al., 1996), neither the right, nor the left, nor the
total temporal lobe volume increased significantly with age
for either sex. In females, the right hippocampal volume
showed a significant increase with age (slope of regression
line = 0.72 mm2/year; P = 0.0041, whereas, in males, the
left amygdala volume increased (slope of regression line =
0.72 mm2/year = 0.06; P = 0.01). However, the slopes of
the left or right amygdala or hippocampus did not significantly differ from each other within each sex. Table 3 shows
the linear regression slopes with age for specific structures.
Scatterplots of the amygdala and hippocampus with
respect to sex and age are presented in Figure 2. Both linear
and nonlinear summaries are displayed. A prominent feature that is evident from the scatterplots is the enormous
variation in structure size. The hypothesis of increased
maturational changes around the time of puberty is not
supported by these relatively linear regression results.

Asymmetries
The temporal lobe, superior temporal gyrus, amygdala,
and hippocampus all exhibited a right-greater-than-left
asymmetry (Table 21, which did not change with age.

DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first large, normative,
morphologic study of the temporal lobe and related medial
temporal structures in children and adolescents. All of the
structures that were measured demonstrated a high degree
of variability. Total temporal lobe volume was stable while
amygdala volume increased, only in males, and hippocampal volume increased, only in females. This pattern is
consistent with the distribution of sex hormone receptors
for these structures, with the amygdala having a predominance of androgen receptors (Clark et al., 1988; Sholl and
Kim, 1989) and the hippocampus having a predominance of
estrogen receptors (Morse et al., 1986).
The hormonal responsivity of the hippocampus in females is supported well by both animal and human studies.
Gonadectomized adult female rats have decreased fiber
outgrowth and altered density of dendritic spines in the
hippocampus, which can be reversed with hormone replacement (Morse et al., 1986; Gould et al., 1990). In humans,
women with gonadal hypoplasia were also noted to have
decreased hippocampal volume (Murphy et al., 1993).
The increase in hippocampal volume in females is consistent with a postmortem study (Benes et al., 1994) of 164
psychiatrically normal individuals (newborn to age 76
years) showing that myelination in the subicular and
presubicular regions of the hippocampus continue throughout adolescence and into adulthood. When adjusted for total
brain weight, the area of myelination doubled between the
first and second decades in this key relay zone. A sexually
dimorphic effect was also noted with females who showed a
greater degree of myelin staining during the interval of
6-29 years but showed no significant differences thereafter.
This is consistent with a recent MRI study of 20 young
adults showing proportionately larger hippocampal volumes in females (Filipek et al., 1994).
In addition to receptors for gonadal steroids, the hippocampus and amygdala are rich in receptors for adrenal
steroids, thyroid hormone, and nerve growth factor
(Gould et al., 1991; Amaral et al., 1992).As well as its direct
effects on hippocampal development, estrogen may influence development by blocking the neurodegenerative effects of glucocorticoids (Sapolsky et al., 1985; Miller et al.,
1989; Sapolsky, 1990). The diversity of afferent and efferent connections to the many distinct nuclei of
the amygdala and the hippocampus as well as the complexity of their various neurochemical systems make the prediction of functional correlates of gross volume changes difficult.
Several limitations of this study should be noted. First,
the use of internal medial landmarks (e.g., the mammillary
bodies) to define structural boundaries does not consider
cytoarchitectonic or sulcaligyral information. With regard

to rightileft asymmetries, the right cerebral hemisphere
tends to be shifted anteriorly compared to the left (Bilder et
al., 19941, and this would favor the observed right-greaterthan-left asymmetries of the amygdala, superior temporal
gyrus, and temporal lobe.
This phenomenon, however, would not account for a
right-greater-than-left hippocampal volume, because the
posterior boundary of the hippocampus (ascending fibers of
the crux of the fornix) was determined on a per-hemisphere
basis, and the location of the boundary between the amygdala and the hippocampus farther posteriorly on the right
should serve to decrease the relative size of the right
hippocampus. The use of sulcal and gyral landmarks on
three-dimensional reconstructed images to define these
structures would be preferable, because it would be more
sensitive to developmental changes in the Sylvian fissure
and the inferior sulcus of the superior temporal gyrus, and
it would provide a more valid index of asymmetry. This
further analysis is planned.
The interpretation of volumetric changes is complicated
by the myriad of factors contributing to structure size,
including the number and size of neurons and glial cells,
packing density, vascularity, and matrix composition. These
parameters, in turn, are affected by genetics, environment,
hormones, growth factors, and nutrients in the developing
nervous system (Diamond et al., 1964; Jacobson, 1991).
Despite this complexity, there are suggestions of a relationship between hippocampal size and memory function in
birds, where food-storing species have larger hippocampal
volumes than related species of nonfood-storing birds (Krebs
et al., 1989; Sherry et al., 1989). Mammals also show a
relationship between spatial memory and hippocampal size
(Sherry et al., 1992). For instance, males of a polygamous
vole species that explore large areas in search of mates and
that perform better on laboratory measures of spatial
ability have significantly larger relative hippocampal volumes than their female counterparts. This sexual dimorphism of hippocampal size is not seen in the monogamous
vole species, which does not show male-female differences
in spatial ability (Jacobs et al., 1990). Such relationships
are less striking in humans, although correlations between
left hippocampus volume and memory for stories have been
noted (Lencz et al., 1992; Goldberget al., 1994).
The stability of the total temporal lobe volume with age
for our sample mirrors findings from the adult literature in
which temporal lobe volumes decrease at a much slower
rate than other brain regions (Coffey et al., 1992; Murphy
et al., 1995). However, stability over time in gross size of a
structure may not be sensitive to qualitative changes in
connectivity or tissue composition.
Anomalies of temporal lobe and medial temporal lobe
structures have been reported for a variety of psychiatric

PEDIATRIC MRI OF TEMPORAL LOBE
disorders, including affective disorders (Swayzeet al., 19921,
autism (Bachevalier, 19941, and, most consistently, schizophrenia (Swayze et al., 1992; Bogerts et al., 19931, which is
increasingly understood as a neurodevelopmental disorder
(Weinberger, 1994). These disorders have marked sex
differences in age of onset, symptomatology, and risk
factors. Our sex-specific maturational differences may have
relevance to the expression of these disorders.
The high variability of structural volumes necessitates
large sample sizes and/or longitudinal studies to quantify
accurately the heterochronous developmental curves in this
population. A longitudinal study of these subjects is underway to validate these cross-sectional results. The sex specificity of these findings should underscore the importance of
sex-matched samples in developmental neuroimaging studies.
